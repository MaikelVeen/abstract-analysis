Cardiac pathology in Mucopolysaccharidosis I mice: Losartan modifies ERK1/2 activation during cardiac remodeling.  ;Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the IDUA gene, that codifies the alpha-L-iduronidase enzyme, which deficiency leads to storage of glycosaminoglycans, with multiple clinical manifestations. One of the leading causes of death in MPS I patients are cardiac complications such as cardiac valve thickening, conduction abnormalities, myocardial dysfunction, and cardiac hypertrophy. The mechanism leading to cardiac dysfunction in MPS I is not entirely understood. In a previous study, we have demonstrated that losartan and propranolol improved the cardiac function in MPS I mice. Thus, we aimed to investigate whether the pathways influenced by these drugs may modulate the cardiac remodeling process in MPS I mice. According to our previous observation, losartan and propranolol restore the heart function, without altering valve thickness. MPS I mice presented reduced activation of AKT and ERK1/2, increased activity of cathepsins, but no alteration in metalloproteinase activity was observed. Animals treated with losartan showed a reduction in cathepsin activity and restored ERK1/2 activation. While both losartan and propranolol improved heart function, no mechanistic evidence was found for propranolol so far. Our results suggest that losartan or propranolol could be used to ameliorate the cardiac disease in MPS I and could be considered as adjuvant treatment candidates for therapy optimization.

Effect of Left and Right Coronary Flow Waveforms on Aortic Sinus Hemodynamics and Leaflet Shear Stress: Correlation with Calcification Locations.  ;Coronary flow induces hemodynamic alterations in the aortic sinus region. The objectives of this study are to: (1) investigate the differences among sinus hemodynamics and leaflet wall shear stresses engendered by the left versus right versus non-coronary flow and (2) correlate respective wall shear stresses with leaflet calcification in patients. A left heart simulator flow loop with a tunable coronary circuit provided physiological coronary flow waveforms corresponding to the left coronary cusp case (LCC), right coronary cusp case (RCC), and non-coronary cusp case (NCC). High spatio-temporal resolution particle image velocimetry was conducted to quantify leaflet wall shear stress and sinus vorticity fields and to measure aortic leaflet tip kinematics. Thirty-one patients with severe calcific aortic valve disease were segmented from CT data for the calcific volumes in their respective left, right, and non-coronary cusps. Leaflet tip position during systole shows the RCC has a wider leaflet opening compared to LCC and NCC. Velocity and vorticity fields combined with leaflet position data show that sinus vorticity is diminished (peak ~ 43 s-1) in the LCC while RCC and NCC maintain high vorticity (~ 1200 and ~ 950 s-1 respectively). WSS magnitudes greater than 0.3 Pa show 20 and 81% greater occurrences in the LCC and RCC respectively compared to NCC. Significant differences [X2 (2, n = 31) = 7.31, p = 0.0258] between the calcification levels in each cusp of the patient population. Coronary flow differences between LCC, RCC, and NCC show significant impact on leaflet kinematics and sinus flow hemodynamics. Clinical data correlations of the coronary flow cases indicate the left coronary cusp has a higher likelihood of calcification compared to the right.

Risk factors of chronic left ventricular dysfunction after cardiac valve surgery.  ;"BACKGROUND: To analyze the risk factors of chronic left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) after cardiac valve surgery. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 860 patients who underwent heart valve surgery in our center from January 2017 to December 2018, including 650 males and 210 females, aged 58±5.8 years. Inclusion criteria: (I) the patient was clinically diagnosed with heart valve disease and met the surgical indications for mitral valve replacement (MVR), mitral valve repair (MVP), aortic valve replacement (AVR) and double valve replacement (DVR); (II) if atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, and tricuspid regurgitation are combined before surgery, radiofrequency ablation, coronary bypass and tricuspid angioplasty were performed contemporarily. Exclusion criteria: (I) preoperative LVEF <50%; (II) aortic dissection underwent Bentall and right heart valve replacement procedures; (III) cardiopulmonary resuscitation and death during perioperative period and 6 months after operation; (IV) postoperative CRRT, IABP, or ECMO assistance; (V) postoperative cardiac dysfunction due to valvular dysfunction, perivalvular leak, or infective endocarditis. Patients were divided into LVD group (LVEF <40%) and control group (LVEF ≥40%) based on cardiac LVEF at 6 months after surgery. Logistic regression was used to analyze the risk factors of postoperative LVD. RESULTS: There were 126 cases in LVD group and 734 cases in control group. There were significant differences in preoperative coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, pulmonary hypertension, NYHA classification, left ventricular end diastolic diameter (LVEDD), and left ventricular end systolic diameter (LVESD) between the two groups (P<0.05). The differences in the changes of LVEDD and LVESD before and after operation between the two groups were statistically significant (P<0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed that preoperative LVEDD >55 mm, preoperative LVESD >40 mm, preoperative combined atrial fibrillation, preoperative combined pulmonary hypertension, preoperative NYHA III-IV, and preoperative combined coronary artery disease were the risks of postoperative chronic LVD. CONCLUSIONS: The left ventricular diameter, preoperative coronary artery disease, NYHA III-IV, preoperative atrial fibrillation, and preoperative pulmonary hypertension are risk factors for chronic LVD after heart valve surgery.

Pulmonary valve replacement in primary repair of tetralogy of Fallot in adult patients.  ;"BACKGROUND: Adults with unrepaired tetralogy of Fallot (ToF) are common in developing countries. Long-term overload of the right ventricle places adult patients at risk for postoperative right heart failure after primary repair, which contributes to morbidity and mortality. The effect of pulmonary valve replacement (PVR) in reducing postoperative morbidity and mortality in adults has never been validated. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study in adults (age ≥18 years) with ToF undergoing primary repair from January 2014 to December 2019 at our institution. Patients were divided into three groups according to techniques used to enlarge the right ventricle outflow tract (RVOT). Baseline variables and perioperative outcomes were collected. The primary endpoint was operative mortality. Secondary endpoints were incidences of right heart failure and stage 3 acute kidney injury (AKI). RESULTS: A total of 56 patients were enrolled (mean age 41.5±11.7 years, 30 females, 53.6%). They were divided into three groups designated as the following: TA-PVR group for trans-annular patch enlargement with PVR; TA group for trans-annulus patch enlargement without PVR; and group AP for annulus preservation. Four patients (7.1%) died postoperatively, all due to right heart failure. All twelve patients in the TA-PVR group survived. There was no significant difference in mortalities among groups. Ten patients (17.9%) developed right heart failure after surgery with no significant difference among groups. Three patients (5.4%) developed stage 3 AKI after surgery, none belonging to the TA-PVR group, however, not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Right heart failure is a common complication after primary repair of adult ToF. Trans-annulus patch enlargement should be cautiously selected in this population. PVR with trans-annulus patch enlargement may be a promising technique to protect against postoperative right heart failure and mortality when annulus preservation is not feasible.  "
Incidental Thoracic Aortic Dilation On Chest Computed Tomography In Patients With Atrial Fibrillation.  ;Individuals with atrial fibrillation (AF) have risk factors that predispose to thoracic aneurysmal disease (TAD) and atherosclerosis. In this study in individuals with AF, we assessed the occurrence of incidental TAD and assessed if a validated predictive score used to predict AF, the CHARGE-AF score, was associated with greater aortic dimensions. We also assessed the prevalence of coronary calcification. We conducted a cross-sectional study of 1,000 consecutive individuals with AF undergoing chest multidetector CT during evaluation for pulmonary vein isolation. A dilated aortic root (AR) or ascending aorta (AA, dimension/ body surface area >2.05cm/m2) were found in 195 (20%). A total of 12 (1%) had significant aortic aneurysmal enlargement of > 5.0cm. Advancing age, a bicuspid aortic valve, hypertension and male gender were associated with increased aortic dimensions. Aortic root dimensions increased linearly (P<0.001) and ascending aortic dimensions increased non-linearly across CHARGE-AF deciles (P<0.001). Nearly two-thirds (63%) had coronary calcification, 38% of whom were not on lipid-lowering therapy. In conclusion, in individuals with AF undergoing gated chest CT, 1 in 5 had previously undetected TAD, with a small proportion having significantly aneurysmal dimensions approaching surgical thresholds. Risk factors previously established to increase the propensity to develop AF are also associated with increased TAD. These findings raise the need to consider a surveillance strategy for TAD in patients with AF, particularly in those with other risk factors for aortic disease. A high prevalence of coronary calcium was also detected, representing an opportunity to optimize statin therapy in patients with AF.  
Usefulness of Thoracic Aortic Calcium to Predict 1-Year Mortality after Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.  ;In patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), vascular disease is associated with increased risk of mortality. Thoracic aortic calcification (TAC), an objective surrogate of vascular disease, could be a predictor of mortality after TAVI. We aimed to analyze the association between TAC burden and 1-year all-cause mortality in patients undergoing TAVI in a US population. From July 2015 through July 2017, a retrospective review of TAVI procedures was performed at Baylor Scott & White-The Heart Hospital, Plano, Texas. Patients were analyzed for comorbidities, cardiac risk factors, and 30-day and 1-year all-cause mortality. Restricted cubic splines (RCS) analysis was used to define low, moderate, and high TAC categories. The association between TAC and survival was evaluated using unadjusted and adjusted Cox models. A total of 431 TAVI procedures were performed, of which TAC was measured in 374 (81%) patients. Median [IQR] age was 82 [77, 87] years, and 51% were male. Median [IQR] STS PROM was 5.6 [4.1, 8.2] %. Overall 30-day and 1-year all-cause mortality was 1% and 10%, respectively. TAC was categorized as low (<1.6 cm3), moderate (1.6 - 2.9 cm3), and high (>2.9 cm3). At 1 year, all-cause mortality was 16% in patients with high TAC compared to 6% in the low and moderate TAC categories (p = 0.008). Unadjusted and adjusted Cox regression analysis showed a significant increase in mortality for patients with high TAC compared with low TAC (HR 2.98, 95% CI [1.34-6.63]), but not significant compared with moderate TAC group. TAC is a predictor of late mortality after TAVI. In conclusion, adding TAC to pre-operative evaluation may provide an objective, reproducible, and potentially widely available tool that can help in shared-decision making.  
Double Valve Replacement in Patients with Mitral Annular Calcification and Aortic Stenosis.  ;Mitral annular calcification (MAC) is a degenerative process of the fibrous structure of the mitral valve (MV). Surgical MV replacement in the presence of MAC is technically challenging due to high calcium burden and is associated with prohibitive operative mortality. There is no standard management strategy for patients with severe aortic stenosis and severe MV disease with MAC. We report a case series of three patients who underwent concomitant surgical, transatrial implantation of a transcatheter heart valve in the mitral position and transcatheter aortic valve replacement.  
Early Outcomes for Surgical Minimally Invasive SAPIEN 3 Transcatheter Mitral Valve Replacement.  ;BACKGROUND: Limited surgical options are available for patients with extensive mitral annular calcification. Several reports have shown the feasibility of surgical mitral valve replacement utilizing a transcatheter aortic valve in the mitral position (MVR-TAVR). We review our 30-day and 1-year outcomes utilizing a minimally invasive approach for MVR-TAVR. METHODS: Between 2017-2019, 16 patients underwent MVR-TAVR under direct vision. Primary endpoints included overall survival, technical success, and effectiveness. Secondary endpoints included valve and cardiac hemodynamics post-operatively and during follow-up. RESULTS: The 16 patients (69% females) were from ages 53 to 88 years (average 77±9). Comorbidities on presentation: 31% (5/16) were reoperative surgeries, 13% (3/16) had right ventricular dysfunction, 31% (5/16) had severe pulmonary hypertension, and 20% (3/16) had chronic kidney disease. Isolated surgery was performed on 69% (11/16) of patients, with a cross-clamp (58%[7/12]) or on a fibrillating heart (42%[5/12]), while concomitant surgery was performed in 31% (5/16) of patients with a cross-clamp. Upon follow up, the estimated 30-day mortality rate was 12.5% and the 1-year mortality rate was 36.2%. A moderate post-operative paravalvular leak (PVL) was evident immediately in one patient and a severe PVL after 30-day follow-up in another. In addition, one patient had mild LVOTO and another had moderate mitral valve stenosis. At 1-year follow up, there were no changes to the mild PVL and moderate stenosis identified post-surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Mini-thoracotomy MVR-TAVR is an acceptable alternative to conventional and transcatheter MVR in patients with mitral valve disease and extensive mitral annular calcification.  
Midterm postoperative prognosis of patients with severe left heart valvular disease combined with moderate or severe pulmonary hypertension treated with treprostinil.  ;BACKGROUND: To investigate the midterm postoperative prognosis of patients with severe left heart valvular disease combined with moderate or severe pulmonary hypertension (PAH) using subcutaneous injection of treprostinil. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on 61 patients with severe left heart valvular disease combined with moderate or severe PAH who had undergone mechanical mitral and/or aortic valve replacement from April 2018 to October 2018. The patients were divided into the treprostinil group and the conventional treatment group according to whether they received treprostinil. The patients were assessed by SwanGanz catheterization, echocardiography, the 6-min walk test (6-MWT), the Borg dyspnoea score and the SF-36 questionnaire. RESULTS: Compared with the preoperative data, the mPAP measured by SwanGanz catheterization, the results of the 6-MWT and the Borg score were significantly improved in both groups during the 1 year follow-up (P < 0.05). Regarding the comparison between the groups, the results in group T were significantly better than those in group C, including the results of the 6-MWT and the general health, vitality and mental health of SF-36 during the 1 year follow-up (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Continuous subcutaneous infusion of treprostinil was not capable of decreasing pulmonary pressures in patients with severe left heart valvular disease combined with moderate or severe PAH during 1 year follow-up, although which some of our data suggest that might improve the symptoms and quality of life of these patients.  
[Surgical treatment of tricuspid valve disease due to permanent pacemaker lead].  ;"Objective: To summarize the etiology and surgical treatment experience of tricuspid valve disease due to permanent pacemaker lead. Methods: The medical records of 22 patients who underwent tricuspid valve operation for tricuspid valve disease due to permanent cardiac pacemaker lead from January 2008 to December 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. There were 12 males and 10 females, with a mean age of (62.6±12.1) years old (45-82 years old). All patients underwent tricuspid valve surgery via open thoracotomy under general anesthesia, including 8 patients through median thoracotomy approach, 4 patients through right mini-thoracotomy approach, and 10 patients with endoscopy-assisted and totally endoscopic technique. Moreover, 8 patients underwent tricuspid valve replacement, and 14 patients received tricuspid valve repair. Results: During the operation, 10 cases of severe tricuspid regurgitation were detected due to valve and subvalvular structures dysfunction involved in the pacing electrode, 7 cases showed tricuspid annulus dilation, and pacing electrode-related infective endocarditis were involved in the tricuspid valve of 5 cases. Compared with conventional median thoracotomy surgery, the amount of postoperative drainage fluid and hospitalization time after minimally invasive surgery (including right mini-thoracotomy and endoscopic surgery) were significantly reduced [281(120, 489) ml vs 368(180, 560) ml, P=0.02; 9.2(4.8, 14.5) d vs 11.2(6.3, 16.9) d, P=0.03]. Postoperative echocardiographic data showed that the size of the right atrium and ventricle in these patients was significantly reduced compared with preoperative data, and their cardiac function were normal. There was no difference of pacing electrode parameters between pre-and postoperative period. All 22 patients were cured and discharged, with no valve-and pacemaker-related complications. Conclusions: Patients with tricuspid valve disease due to permanent cardiac pacemaker lead should actively undergo surgery including tricuspid replacement or repair according to different etiologies, which exhibit satisfactory outcomes. Minimally invasive endoscopic tricuspid surgery is a new technique for the treatment of isolated tricuspid valve disease, with less surgical trauma and faster recovery.  "
Subcoronary Ross/Ross-Konno operation in children and young adults: initial single-centre experience.  ;OBJECTIVES: We sought to evaluate the outcome after modified subcoronary Ross/Ross-Konno operation in children and young adults. METHODS: Between January 2013 and January 2019, a total of 50 patients with median age of 6.3 years (range 0.02-36.5 years, 58% males), including 10 infants (20%), received modified subcoronary Ross/Ross-Konno operation at our institution. Survival, morbidity, reinterventions, aortic valve function and aortic root dimensions were analysed. RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 31.2 months (range 14.4-51 months), there were 1 early death and 1 late death, both in the infant group. The overall survival at 5 years after the operation was 95%. Two patients needed aortic valve replacement, 11 and 15 months after their Ross operation. At 5 years, freedoms from reoperation on the autograft and on the right ventricle to pulmonary artery conduit were 94% and 97%, respectively. Freedom from aortic valve regurgitation greater than mild was 97% at 5 years. Median dimensions of the aortic root at all levels remained in normal range at last visit. Forty-four patients (95%) were in New York Heart Association class I with normal left ventricular function. CONCLUSIONS: The initial experience with the subcoronary Ross/Ross-Konno operation in children and young adults showed excellent outcome. The mortality and morbidity among infants remain significant. The described technique is reproducible and might be advantageous in situations when prosthetic supporting techniques interfere with somatic growth.  
Final 5-year outcomes following aortic valve replacement with a RESILIA™ tissue bioprosthesis.  ;OBJECTIVES: Long-term durability of bioprosthetic valves is predominantly limited by structural valve deterioration. RESILIA™ tissue has exhibited reduced calcification in pre-clinical and early clinical studies. This study evaluated the 5-year clinical and haemodynamic outcomes of an aortic valve with this tissue. METHODS: This was a prospective, non-randomized, single-arm study of 133 patients implanted with a RESILIA aortic bioprosthesis between July 2011 and February 2013 at 2 sites in Poland. Clinical outcomes and haemodynamic performance were assessed annually for 5 years post-implant. Safety events were adjudicated by a Clinical Events Committee and echocardiographic data were assessed by an independent core laboratory. RESULTS: Mean patient age was 65.3 ± 13.5 years, with 34 patients (25.6%) ≤60. The mean follow-up was 4.2 ± 1.5 years. Early (≤30 days) and late (>30 days) all-cause mortality were 2.3% (N = 3) and 3.2%/late patients-years (N = 18) respectively. Early events included thromboembolism in 3 patients (2.3%). Late valve-related events included endocarditis in 1 patient, which led to explant, and valve thrombosis in another patient. There were no events of structural valve deterioration throughout the study. At 5 years, mean gradient was 14.8 ± 7.6 mmHg and effective orifice area was 1.4 ± 0.5 cm2, a marked improvement over baseline values. All New York Heart Association class III patients and most class II patients at baseline had improved classifications at 5 years. CONCLUSIONS: The bioprosthesis with RESILIA tissue demonstrated a good safety profile with excellent haemodynamic performance over 5 years of follow-up. These encouraging outcomes warrant additional investigation of this novel tissue. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT01651052.  
[The expression level of cytokine genes in the cases of native heart valves in infectious endocarditis].  ;"The expression level of IL1B, IL6, IL8, IL10, IL12A, IL12B, IL18, IL23, IL33, CCL2, and IL1RL1 has been investigated using biopsies of native mitral, aortic, and tricuspid valves obtained during surgical correction of acquired defect from 25 patients with infectious endocarditis. Biopsies of native mitral and aortic valve cusps from 12 patients who underwent surgical correction of acquired heart disease of non-infectious etiology were used as control. We used quantitative PCR with fluorescent dye SYBR Green for determination of the cytokine gene expression level. This study revealed that genes could be subdivided into three groups: (i) genes with increased expression (IL1B, IL6, and IL8); (ii) genes with reduced expression (IL33 and IL1RL1); (iii) genes with unchanged expression (IL12A, IL18, IL23, and CCL2). The IL8 gene expression was characterized by the most pronounced increase (9.83 times versus control), while the IL1RL1 gene demonstrated the most pronounced decrease in its expression (4.17 times). Expression of IL10 and IL12B genes was negligible in all samples.  "
Assessment of D-Shaped Annulus of Mitral Valve in Patients with Severe MR Using Semi-Automated 4-Dimensional Analysis: Implications for Transcatheter Interventions.  ;The development of transcatheter mitral valve replacement therapies requires accurate post-processing analysis tools to provide D-shaped mitral annulus dimensions from 3-dimensional (3D) data. The agreement between two semi-automated, software packages to process 3D transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) data for the measurement of the mitral valve annulus dimensions was evaluated. 3DTEE data of patients with moderate-severe mitral regurgitation (MR) were postprocessed with semi-automated, vendor-independent (VI) software and vendor-specific (VS) software. Both post-processing software provided key measurements for the selection of transcatheter valve prosthesis size: annulus area, annulus circumference and the septal-to-lateral distance of the annulus. The intertrigonal distance was provided only by the VS software. The inter- and intra-observer agreements were assessed with Bland-Altman analysis. Of 105 patients (63.8 ± 11 years, 66% male) with MR, 28 had secondary MR, 45 fibroelastic deficiency, and 32 Barlow's disease. Using VS software, the dimensions for the overall population were 16.1 ± 4.6 cm2 for annulus area, for circumference 14.4 ± 1.9 cm, intertrigonal distance 3.4 ± 0.5 cm and septal-to-lateral distance 3.8 ± 0.6 cm. Similar dimensions were obtained using VI software: 15.7 ± 4.6 cm2 for annulus area, 14.5 ± 2.0 cm for circumference, and 4.1 ± 0.6 cm for septal-to-lateral distance. The inter- and intra-observer agreement for both software programs was excellent. In conclusion, current post-processing software programs for 3DTEE data of the mitral valve annulus provide good reproducibility of key measurements to select the transcatheter prosthesis size.  
Determinants of clinical outcomes of surgery for isolated severe tricuspid regurgitation.  ;"OBJECTIVES: Although the incidence of patients with isolated tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is increasing, data regarding the clinical outcomes of isolated TR surgery are limited. This study sought to investigate the prognostic implications according to procedural types, and to identify preoperative predictors of clinical outcomes after isolated TR surgery. METHODS: Among consecutive 2610 patients receiving tricuspid valve (TV) procedure, we analysed 238 patients (age, 59.6 years; 143 females) who underwent stand-alone TV surgery (repair, 132; replacement, 106) for severe TR. Primary outcome was the composite of all-cause mortality and heart transplantation. Clinical outcomes between the repair and the replacement groups were compared after adjusting with the inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) method. RESULTS: During follow-up (median, 4.1 years), 53 patients died and 4 received heart transplantation. Multivariable analysis revealed that age (p=0.001), haemoglobin level (p=0.003), total bilirubin (p=0.040), TR jet area (p=0.005) and right atrial (RA) pressure (p=0.022) were independent predictors of the primary outcome. After IPTW adjustment, there were no significant intergroup differences in the risk of primary outcome (HR 1.01; 95% CI 0.55 to 1.87). In the subgroup analysis, tricuspid annular diameter was identified as a significant effect modifier (p=0.012) in the comparison between repair versus replacement, showing a trend favouring replacement in patients with annular diameter >44 mm. CONCLUSIONS: The outcomes of stand-alone severe TR surgery were independently associated with the severity of TR and RA pressure. In selected patients with severe annular dilation >44 mm, replacement may become a feasible option.  "
Valve-sparing aortic root surgery in children and adults with congenital heart disease.  ;DOI: 10.1016/j.jtcvs.2020.08.116 PMID: 33139062  
Assessment of right ventricular systolic function by tissue motion annular displacement in healthy dogs.  ;"INTRODUCTION/OBJECTIVES: There are few parameters for assessment of right ventricular (RV) systolic function on echocardiographic examination. Morphofunctional studies are limited by the irregular shape of the RV. Recently, tissue motion annular displacement (TMAD), a technique that evaluates valve annulus displacement toward the cardiac apex, has shown a good correlation with left ventricular global longitudinal strain (GLS) in healthy dogs. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the longitudinal systolic function of the RV of healthy dogs using TMAD. ANIMALS: A hundred healthy client-owned dogs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cross-sectional study. Physical examination, electrocardiogram, blood pressure measurement, and echocardiography were recorded. The systolic function of the RV was evaluated by GLS free wall and TMAD. Data were compared with those derived from conventional echocardiography. RESULTS: TMAD values varied according to body weight. There was a correlation of TMAD in millimeters with all indices of RV systolic function, including GLS free wall (R:-0.239; p:0.017). TMAD had a correlation with age and heart rate; whereas there was no relationship with sex and blood pressure. The coefficient of variation for the intraobserver evaluation was lower for the TMAD in millimeters (9.9%) compared with the GLS free wall (17.9%). In addition, the mean time to perform TMAD (8.1 s) was lower than that of the GLS free wall (37.7 s). CONCLUSIONS: TMAD is a fast, reproducible, and promising method for assessing RV systolic function in healthy dogs. However, further studies are needed to understand the applicability of this technique in patients with heart disease.  "
The progression rate of aortic stenosis: key to tailoring the management and potential target for treatment.  ;: Aortic stenosis is the most frequent valvular disease to require intervention in the western world and has always been featured as a progressive disease. The rate of progression can be assessed by carefully performed Doppler echocardiography and can vary greatly between individuals with a profound impact on prognosis. Unfortunately, the determinants of disease progression had been insufficiently studied and remain challenging to define, particularly in the outpatient setting. Multiple factors have been proposed and tested, but at present, there are no proven therapies to slow the course of the stenotic process. Heart valve clinics may be particularly important to define the progression rate and tailor follow-up and management at an individual level. This review enlightens knowledge and gaps regarding the progression-rate of aortic valve stenosis, from the historical perspective to the molecular one.

Tricuspid valve diseases: Interventions on the forgotten heart valve.  ;"Over the past few decades, the tricuspid valve (TV) interventions have been relatively lower compared to other cardiac valvular disease in terms of pathophysiology and management, especially regarding surgical intervention and therapy. However, recent crucial advances in assessment and management of the TV disease have resulted in a renewed interest in the ""forgotten valve."" The medical treatment aims to cure the underlying disease and address the presentation of the right heart failure. Surgical interventions have proven to yield good outcomes for those for whom surgery is indicated. For those who are not suitable for surgery, transcatheter surgery may prove to be a suitable replacement. Best practice with regard to surgical techniques is still in question due to limited data. This has been slowing the introduction of transcatheter interventions into common practical guidelines. The aim of this literature review is to discuss new insights on the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and interventions of TV disease, highlighting the surgical management and emerging transcatheter therapies. In addition, this review will provide an overview of the current state of the literature surrounding TV interventions and providing suggestions for future directives.  "
Transcatheter aortic valve implantation versus surgical aortic valve replacement during the COVID-19 pandemic-Current practice and concerns.  ;COVID-19 has had a dramatic impact on the provision of healthcare. COVID-19 can manifest with cardiac and thrombotic presentations. Additionally, patients with cardiovascular comorbidities are at an increased risk of adverse outcomes related to COVID-19 infection. This in turn has led to a significant reduction in the provision of cardiac surgery with alternative management options utilized to address patients with significant disease. In terms of aortic valve disease, transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) provides advantages over surgical aortic valve replacement in with a lower burden on healthcare resources. COVID-19 also resulted in changes in management strategies and as such TAVI is now being considered in younger- and low-risk patients. However, long term data with regard to TAVI is still unknown, and the use in patient groups that have been excluded in the large pivotal studies that established TAVI as an alternative to surgery has raised specific concerns in the use of TAVI as the preferred treatment choice. With the long term ramification unknown, it is essential that decisions are made with caution.  
Embolized mechanical aortic valve leaflet causing infrarenal aortic stenosis and claudication.  ;Leaflet escape from mechanical heart valves is a rare but potentially fatal complication of prosthetic valve replacement. Historically, the incompetent valve is replaced emergently and the escaped leaflet is subsequently retrieved from its settlement in a distal vessel. If it is not retrieved, the fragment can increase the risk of infection, thrombosis, and migration. We report a case of a mechanical aortic valve leaflet that embolized during valve reoperation and caused occlusive aortic disease found 2 years later. This case emphasizes the importance of locating leaflet fragments after they are noticed missing.  
Candida parapsilosis endocarditis. Report of cases and review of the literature.  ;INTRODUCTION: Infective endocarditis (IE) due to Candida species is a rare disease representing about 1-2% of all IE cases and carries a high mortality rate. Given the rarity of the disease, there are no clear guidelines on the type and duration of antifungal therapy. Thus, long-term or even life-long antifungal treatment is commonly used. CASE REPORT: We report two patients with prosthetic valve C. parapsilosis IE and persistent candidemia that failed conservative treatment and ultimately developed heart failure. They underwent prosthetic valve replacement and prolonged antifungal treatment with favorable outcome. DISCUSSION: Candida IE commonly occurs in the setting of underlying malignancy, chronic liver disease, previous endocarditis, previous antimicrobial exposure, previous abdominal surgery, intravenous drug use, presence of a central venous catheter, and previous cardiac surgery. Both present patients had undergone a cardiac surgery and had a prosthetic heart valve, while one patient had an underlying autoimmune disease that could be associated with higher risk of IE. In both patients transthoracic ultrasound failed to diagnose IE. In our patients, conservative treatment alone was not enough to control the infection, thus, both patients underwent valve replacement and were subsequently treated with antifungals for 6 weeks. Furthermore, both patients were put on long-term antifungal suppression treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Given the absence of controlled randomized trials, the treatment of Candida endocarditis mostly relies on experts' opinion, and, thus, future studies focusing on the type and duration of antifungal treatment are required.  
A Blast From the Past: Radiation Therapy During Childhood Causing Cardiac Fibrosis and Calcification Leading to Complete Heart Block.  ;"Complete heart block (CHB) in a young patient is a rare phenomenon necessitating an extensive workup to identify the etiology of conduction disturbance. Radiotherapy of the thorax is a known risk factor for cardiomyopathy; however, CHB is a rare complication. Here we present a case of a 46-year-old man who presented with CHB and was found to have significant cardiac fibrosis and calcification of the mitral valve annulus. His management required a multidisciplinary and multimodality approach to be able to identify childhood radiation as the cause of cardiomyopathy and establish a personalized management strategy with cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator. This case highlights radiation therapy as an important cause of cardiac conduction abnormalities even decades later, and the importance of extensive search for other reversible etiologies using the multimodality approach.

Giant right atrium: a long-term complication of rheumatic heart disease.  ;Giant right atrium (RA) is a rare entity often seen during childhood due to congenital anomalies. Limited literature has reported such finding in patients with rheumatic valvular heart disease. Here we present a case of a 68-year-old female with a history of rheumatic valve disease treated with a Starr Edwards mechanical ball-in-cage mitral valve replacement and tricuspid valve annuloplasty ring procedures. The patient developed heart failure and had multiple hospital admissions over three decades for heart failure exacerbations mostly triggered by medication and dietary non-compliance. She eventually developed a giant RA that filled most of her thorax. This case demonstrates an extreme form of cardiac remodeling caused by long-term rheumatic valvular heart disease.  
The Role of National Registries in Improving Quality of Care and Outcomes for Cardiovascular Disease.  ;Cardiovascular registries play an integral role in providing real-world data on a number of cardiovascular conditions and allowing measurement of quality metrics across a large cohort of patients. Over the past 35 years, the number of cardiovascular registries has skyrocketed, and their use will only continue to grow as data on novel procedures and devices will need to be collected and analyzed. The American College of Cardiology and Society of Thoracic Surgeons Transcatheter Valve Therapy Registry is just one example of a modern registry that plays a crucial role in collecting data on patients undergoing transcatheter valvular procedures. Through public reporting registries, data can be shared on a hospital and provider level for many quality performance measures. There remains much work to be done on allowing automated data extraction from the electronic medical record directly into registries. No matter how sophisticated and complete a registry is, it can never overcome the problem of treatment selection bias that is inherent in observational data. This review discusses the growth, benefits, and limitations of national registries and their role in developing evidence for best clinical practice, measuring outcomes, providing feedback to clinicians, and improving quality of care.  
Percutaneous mitral valve repair with MitraClip XTR for acute mitral regurgitation due to papillary muscle rupture.  ;Papillary muscle rupture is an infrequent and highly morbid mechanical complication of acute myocardial infarction. Surgical repair or replacement is traditionally considered first-line therapy. However, many of these patients present in extremis with prohibitively high surgical risk. Repair of mitral regurgitation with the MitraClip device (Abbot Vascular, Menlo Park, CA, USA) is an established therapy to treat degenerative and functional mitral regurgitation. We present a case of successful repair of severe mitral regurgitation due to papillary muscle rupture in the setting of acute myocardial infarction. A two-clip strategy resulted in mild residual mitral regurgitation with resolution of cardiogenic shock and refractory hypoxemia requiring veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Six-month follow-up echocardiogram identified durable results with mild mitral regurgitation and left ventricular ejection fraction of 63 %. Our case demonstrates that percutaneous mitral valve repair with MitraClip is a well-tolerated procedure that can provide acute and long-term benefit for patients with acute mitral regurgitation due to papillary muscle rupture who are at prohibitively high surgical risk. <Learning Objective: Our case illustrates the role of MitraClip in acute mitral regurgitation due to papillary muscle rupture in cardiogenic shock as an alternative to surgical intervention in extremely high-risk patients.>.  
Open-heart transseptal transcatheter mitral valve implantation with mitral annular calcification.  ;Mitral valve replacement (MVR) using a prosthesis of transcatheter aortic valve implantation for mitral annular calcification (MAC) is an alternative procedure which is very different from a conventional MVR and is safe. Acceptable results including mortality and morbidity have been reported. We report the case of a male patient treated with this procedure. There was a risk of left ventricular rupture due to extensive decalcification, so we performed transcatheter mitral valve implantation (TMVI). Since he had a history of surgical aortic valve replacement (AVR), we chose open-heart transseptal approach so as not to interfere with the aortic prosthesis. TMVI has a risk of an iatrogenic left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction. Using open-heart transseptal approach, we could easily check an anterior commissure of mitral annulus to prevent LVOT obstruction. <Learning objective: Transcatheter mitral valve implantation (TMVI) using a transcatheter aortic prosthesis is safe for mitral valve disease with mitral annular calcifications. This patient had a history of surgical aortic valve replacement, so we performed open-heart transseptal TMVI to prevent interference with the aortic prosthesis and the iatrogenic left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.>.  
Peripheral arterial embolism and pyrexia in a young patient without comorbidities.  ;Peripheral arteries embolism can be located in various organs. It can be caused by many medical conditions, diagnosis and treatment of which allows to prevent further complications. A CASE REPORT: 26-year-old male patient was admitted to the Department of Internal Medicine, Hypertension and Vascular Diseases due to lasting over two months fatigue, recurrent pyrexia, weight loss and abdominal pain. Prior to that, he presented to physician several times. First time because of left foot pain with oedema and fever. USG revealed embolus in anterior tibial artery. Outpatient antibiotic, antithrombotic and anti-inflammatory treatment was given. The symptoms subsided, but appeared in other limb. After a while patient presented with pyrexia, fatigue, abdominal and lumbar region pain and melaena. CT showed infarction of spleen and left kidney. Once again outpatient treatment with amoxicillin with clavulanate was administered. Eventually, at admission to the clinic, infective endocarditis (IE) with dental origin was suspected. Echocardiography showed vegetation on bicuspid aortic valve, causing regurgitation. Blood culture was taken and empiric antimicrobial therapy with ampicillin, gentamicin and cloxacillin was administered. Blood culture was positive for Streptococcus sanguinis. Carious teeth were extracted, then the aortic valve replacement surgery was performed. Ampicillin was replaced with vancomycin, and gentamicin was continued. After the surgery, patient's condition improved. He was discharged on demand without completing antibiotic treatment, so he had follow-up appointment and IE prophylaxis recommended. CONCLUSIONS: Despite peripheral embolism is common manifestation of IE, this disease is relatively rare and not suspected in young people. The symptoms can be non-specific, what makes diagnosis challenging, as described in this case.  
Multimodality imaging of mitral annular disjunction.  ;Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is diagnosed by auscultation and echocardiography in about 2-3% of the general population and takes rather a benign course. However, in some patients, ventricular arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death (SCD) occur, which is linked to mitral annular disjunction (MAD). MAD is defined as distinct separation of the mitral valve annulus-left atrial wall continuum and the basal region of the posterolateral left ventricular (LV) myocardium. MAD results in disturbed inferior-posterior LV wall and posteromedial papillary muscle stretch giving rise to local fibrosis presenting in cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) as late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and posing a substrate for malignant arrhythmia. Multidetector-row computed tomography (MDCT) in MAD patients is still rarely used.

[Management of Patients with Cardiac Failure Undergoing General Thoracic Surgery].  ;Recent changes in the demographics of surgical candidates, in terms of age, have increased the number of patients with surgical risk factors. In patients with preoperative cardiac diseases such as myocardial ischemia, arrhythmia, or congestive heart failure, it is important to offer any necessary preoperative medical examinations and treatments because postoperative cardiac failure is more of a concern in patients with already abnormal cardiac physiology, undergoing significant lung resection. Thoracic surgeons should be challenged by another conundrum to accurately select the best candidates for surgical treatment. Usually perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy in patients who need general thoracic operations such as lung cancer surgery after coronary artery stent placement or valve replacement have made recommendations, and heparinization is needed for patients with atrial fibrillation for prevention of thrombo-embolism. It is sometimes used in clinical practice as bridging therapy during the period of discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy for patients with cardiac complications after several cardiac surgery. As points to be aware of regarding surgical operations, minimal invasive surgery probably should be performed if possible.  
[Surgical Strategy for Pulmonary Atresia with Ventricular Septal Defect with Major Aortopulmonary Collateral Artery].  ;Although the characteristics and pathophysiology of major aortopulmonary collateral artery (MAPCA) have been better understood, treatment of pulmonary atresia and ventricular septal defect with MAPCA remains challenging. The difficulty in treating this disease is the lack of availability of pulmonary homografts required for pulmonary angioplasty in Japan and the need for manipulation of the posterior mediastinum region, which is not performed in normal cardiac surgery. It is important to build an appropriate surgical strategy by means of preoperative computed tomography( CT) and selective angiography. For treatment, unifocalization or rehabilitation is selected depending on the condition of MAPCA and central pulmonary artery. Because unifocalization is highly invasive, it would be performed at 6 months of age and weigh 5 kg. As a procedure, extensive dissection is performed, and anastomoses between tissue to tissue are basically performed, and reconstruction of the right ventricular outflow tract is performed using a valved conduit that can secure anterograde pulmonary blood flow that is not affected by the condition of the lung. It is effective to confirm postoperative lung perfusion scan and CT, perform a cardiac catheterization test approximately 6 months after surgery, and maintain the pulmonary vessels with catheter intervention if necessary. The ultimate goal of treating this disease is not only to improve cyanosis, but also to maintain pulmonary circulation at lower right ventricular pressure.  
[Surgical Management for Cardiac and Aortic Lesion Caused by Arteritis].  ;"Arteritis is an inflammatory disease of the vessel walls, resulting in vascular damage and a wide variety of clinical symptoms and multisystem disorders. Because aneurysmal disease, coronary disease, and aortic insufficiency affect patient prognosis, surgical intervention plays an important role. Preoperatively, systemic vessels, cardiac function, and other major organs should be evaluated. Regarding the surgical technique, reinforcement of the anastomosis to the fragile aortic wall is important to prevent pseudoaneurysmal formation and prosthetic valvular detachment. As aortic root replacement, we have been applying the modified Bentall procedure with a ""double fixation technique"" and obtained desirable outcomes. Although endovascular repair for aneurysmal disease is one of the treatment options, its longterm efficacy remains uncertain. Postoperative control of inflammation with corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressive agents is also important for long-term management. Pseudoaneurysmal formation and prosthetic valvular detachment may occur progressively over a long period of time. To prevent these complications, strict follow-up with imaging and inflammation control should be performed.  "
[Aortic Valve Surgery for Patients with Severely Calcified Aorta].  ;Severe atherosclerosis of the ascending aorta frequently causes difficulties during heart operations, hindering surgical maneuvers and potentially leading to systemic embolism. There have been several methods to solve these problems but the best way to treat patients requiring aortic valve replacement (AVR) has not been established yet. Surgical techniques for AVR in these patients include AVR under deep hypothermic circulatory arrest with or without endarterectomy of the ascending aorta or replacement of the ascending aorta. Endovascular clamping using a balloon is another approach but require manipulation of the heavily calcified aorta that may result in a certain risk for stroke. Another option to avoid the ascending aorta and cross-clamping is the apico-aortic conduit. Trans-catheter AVR( TAVR),especially trans-apical AVR, has been shown to be feasible in such patients. Large studies and longer follow-up will be required to scientifically prove the superiority of trans-apical AVR over conventional surgical strategies in patients with porcelain aorta requiring AVR.  
"[Covering Suture Line Using Bovine Pericardium during Mitral Valve Replacement for Third Time Infectious Endocarditis;Report of a Case].  ";"A 33-year-old man presenting with fever, fatigue, and delirium was diagnosed with infectious endocarditis(IE). He had already undergone surgery for IE twice;initial valve repair 4 years ago and mitral valve replacement(MVR) 1 year later. He has refractory atopic dermatitis, which was considered to be the cause of his repeated IE. Initially, antibiotics were administered but the infection was not controlled. Therefore, we decided to perform the 3rd surgery. MVR was performed, and using bovine pericardium, we covered valve cuff and suture felts to separete these parts from blood stream. Postoperative echocardiography showed good prosthetic valve motion without transvalvular regurgitation or paravalvular leak. He was discharged on the 39th postoperative day and has been doing well for 2 years since.  "
"[Mitral Valve Plasty in a Patient with Multiple Metal Allergy;Report of a Case].  ";A 76-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital complaining of dyspnea on effort. Echocardiography showed severe mitral regurgitation. Her medical history indicated that she was allergic to metal, and skin patch tests were positive for nickel, cobalt, platinum, manganese, iridium, chromium, and zinc. Valvuloplasty involved triangular resection of P2 and mitral valve annuloplasty with a metal-free, 29 mm Tailor Flexible Ring. The sternum was closed using polyester non-absorbable sutures instead of surgical steel wire. Her postoperative course was uneventful and she was discharged on postoperative day 21. Nine months later, she is well and free of allergic symptoms.  
"[Severe Calcification on Glutaraldehyde-treated Autologous Pericardium after Mitral Valve Repair by Leaflet Augmentation;Report of a Case].  ";We report a case of surgical treatment of mitral valve stenosis due to severe calcification on the glutaraldehyde-treated autologous pericardium. A 39-year-old woman presented with progressive dyspnea. She had undergone mitral valve repair by leaflet augmentation with a glutaraldehyde-treated autologous pericardium for mitral regurgitation 3 years before. Transthoracic echocardiography showed mitral valve stenosis with limited movement of the anterior leaflet. At redo surgery, severe calcification was observed of the glutaraldehyde-treated autologous pericardium patch on the anterior mitral leaflet. Mitral valve replacement was performed successfully, and she was discharged on postoperative day 14.  
"[Valve Re-replacement Combined with Patch Enlargement of the Aortic Annulus for Bioprosthetic Valve Deterioration;Report of a Case].  ";A 42-year-old woman had undergone aortic valve replacement with a 19 mm bioprosthetic valve for aortic stenosis due to a bicuspid valve 8 years before. She was admitted to our hospital for valve re-replacement owing to the prosthetic valve dysfunction. As the patient's valve annulus was markedly thickened owing to pannus formation, we were unable to pass a 19 mm valve sizer through the annulus even after removal of the prosthetic valve and the tissue surrounding the annulus. Valve re-replacement combined with patch enlargement of the aortic annulus was performed to obtain maximally effective orifice area. Her postoperative course was uneventful, and echocardiography revealed no perivalvular leak. In valve re-replacement, it is important to remove the prosthetic valve and the tissue surrounding the annulus to the greatest extent possible and consider patch enlargement of the aortic annulus to avoid patient-prosthesis mismatch in a patient with a small aortic annulus.  
"[Valve-sparing Root Reimplantation for Stanford Type A Acute Aortic Dissection Combined with Aortic Root Dilation and Bicuspid Aortic Valve;Report of a Case].  ";A 45-year-old male developed Stanford type A acute aortic dissection combined with aortic root dilation and congenital bicuspid aortic valve (BAV). He had a Sieveres type 0 BAV, lateral subtype with right and left cusps. Valve-sparing root reimplantation was performed with decalcification of the cusps. Transthoracic echocardiography(TTE) at discharge revealed no aortic regurgitation, and peak velocity of BAV was 2.15 m/second, mean pressure gradient was 9.6 mmHg and aortic valve area was 2.15 cm2. TTE after 6 months revealed only slight elevation of the peak velocity to 2.78 m/second. To perform successful reimplantation in the case of BAV, anatomic orientation of the cusps should be approximately at 180° and the tissue of the cusps should either be normal or have only minor abnormalities. Valve-sparing root reimplantation for BAV needs a careful follow-up for progression of the aortic valve dysfunction.  
[Giant Left Atrial Myxoma Complicated with Hemorrhagic Cerebral Infarction].  ;A 48-year-old woman developed paralysis of the left upper limb and dysarthria. Two days later, she was admitted to a local hospital due to no improvement of symptoms. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed acute hemorrhagic cerebral infarction in the left nucleus basalis. Echocardiography demonstrated a large left atrial mass in the left atrium, shuttling between the left atrium and the left ventricle and moderate mitral regurgitation. Then, she was transferred to our hospital for surgery. Five days after the initial symptoms, resection of the left atrial mass was performed under total cardiopulmonary bypass. First, heparin sodium, and then nafamostat mesilate were used as intraoperative anticoagulation treatment. The left mitral mass was removed via an atrial septal incision and the defect was repaired using a bovine pericardium. The mitral valve was intact and there was no regurgitation. The mass was immunohistologically diagnosed as myxoma. Postoperative brain computed tomography scans demonstrated no exacerbation of the cerebral infarction. She was discharged 13 days after surgery without neurological symptoms.  
Resolving the Disproportionate Left Ventricular Enlargement in Mitral Valve Prolapse Due to Barlow Disease: Insights From Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance.  ;OBJECTIVES: This study hypothesized that left ventricular (LV) enlargement in Barlow disease can be explained by accounting for the total volume load that consists of transvalvular mitral regurgitation (MR) and the prolapse volume. BACKGROUND: Barlow disease is characterized by long prolapsing mitral leaflets that can harbor a significant amount of blood-the prolapse volume-at end-systole. The LV in Barlow disease can be disproportionately enlarged relative to MR severity, leading to speculation of Barlow cardiomyopathy. METHODS: Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) was used to compare MR, prolapse volume, and heart chambers remodeling in patients with Barlow disease (bileaflet prolapse [BLP]) and in single leaflet prolapse (SLP). RESULTS: A total of 157 patients (81 with BLP, 76 with SLP) were included. Patients with SLP were older and more had hypertension. Patients with BLP had more heart failure. Indexed LV end-diastolic volume was larger in BLP despite similar transvalvular MR. However, the prolapse volume was larger in BLP, which led to larger total volume load compared with SLP. Increasing tertiles of prolapse volume and MR both led to an incremental increase in LV end-diastolic volume in BLP. Using the total volume load improved the correlation with indexed LV end-diastolic volume in the BLP group, which closely matched that of SLP. A multivariable model that incorporated the prolapse volume explained left heart chamber enlargement better than a MR-based model, independent of prolapse category. CONCLUSIONS: The prolapse volume is part of the total volume load exerted on the LV during the cardiac cycle and could help explain the disproportionate LV enlargement relative to MR severity noted in Barlow disease.

Three-year outcomes of the postapproval study of the AtriCure Bipolar Radiofrequency Ablation of Permanent Atrial Fibrillation Trial.  ;OBJECTIVES: The Cox Maze IV operation is commonly performed concomitant with other cardiac operations and effectively reduces the burden of atrial fibrillation. Prospective randomized trials have reported outcomes early and at 12 months, but only single-center late durability results are available. As part of the postapproval process for a bipolar radiofrequency ablation system, we sought to determine early and midterm outcomes of patients undergoing the Cox Maze IV operation. METHODS: A prospective, multicenter, single-arm study of 363 patients (mean age, 70 years, 82% valve surgery) with nonparoxysmal atrial fibrillation (mean duration, 60 months, 94% Congestive heart failure, Hypertension, Age ≥ 75, Diabetes, Stroke, VAScular disease, Age 65-74, Sex category ≥2) undergoing concomitant Maze IV atrial fibrillation ablation at 40 sites with 70 surgeons was performed between June 2010 and October 2014. Compliance with the study lesion set was 94.5%, and 99% had left atrial appendage closure. Freedom from atrial fibrillation was determined by extended monitoring, with a 48-hour Holter monitor minimum. RESULTS: There were no device-related complications. Freedom from atrial fibrillation off antiarrhythmic medications at 1, 2, and 3 years was 66%, 65%, and 64%, respectively, and including those using antiarrhythmics was 80%, 78%, and 76%, respectively. Warfarin was used in 49%, 44%, and 40%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with nonparoxysmal atrial fibrillation, compliance with the protocol was high, and freedom from atrial fibrillation off antiarrhythmics was high and sustained to 3 years. The safety and effectiveness of the system and Cox Maze IV procedure support the Class I guideline recommendation for concomitant atrial fibrillation ablation in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.  
How to incorporate left atrial strain in the diagnostic algorithm of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.  ;"The combination of early trans-mitral inflow and mitral annular tissue Doppler velocities (E/e' ratio) is widely applied to noninvasively estimate left ventricular (LV) filling pressures. However, when E/e' is between 8 and 14 its accuracy decreases substantially. Left atrial (LA) deformation analysis by speckle tracking echocardiography was recently proposed as an alternative approach to estimate LV filling pressures, but its role when E/e' is between 8 and 14 has been under-investigated. We aimed to assess whether LA strain could help to identify elevated filling pressures in patients with E/e' between 8 and 14. Among consecutive non-selected patients who underwent a comprehensive echocardiographic evaluation, we enrolled those with E/e' ratio > 8 and ≤ 14. Exclusion criteria were: organic mitral valve disease or mitral surgery; presence of mitral regurgitation greater than moderate in severity; diseases associated with pre-capillary pulmonary hypertension; and undetectable systolic pulmonary artery pressure (PAP-S). Peak LA longitudinal (PALS) and contraction strain (PACS) values was obtained by averaging all segments, and by separately averaging segments measured in the 4-chamber and 2-chamber views. Seventy-six patients had E/e' > 8 and ≤ 14 and formed the study cohort. Mean age 69 ± 12 years, LV ejection fraction (LVEF) 54.5 ± 11.2%, mean E/e' 11.2 ± 1.9, PAP-S 33 ± 7 mmHg, PALS 31.6 ± 11.7%. PALS was significantly associated to PAP-S after adjustment for LVEF, E/e', septal LV longitudinal shortening velocity (s'), LA volume indexed (p = 0.002) and also for ASE/EACVI diastolic dysfunction classification (p = 0.0002). Furthermore, PALS but not ASE/EACVI diastolic dysfunction grading, resulted independently associated to New York Heart Association (NYHA) class (p = 0.0004). PALS is able to predict increased intra-cardiac pressure and NYHA class in patients characterized by E/e' between 8 and 14. Therefore, we propose that PALS might be incorporated in a simplified diagnostic algorithm based on E/e' classes.  "
Cor triatriatum in adulthood with mitral valve regurgitation and atrial fibrillation.  ;Cor triatriatum is a rare congenital heart disease. A 57-year-old woman had cor triatriatum with severe mitral valve regurgitation (MR) and atrial fibrillation (AF). We performed mitral valve repair, left atrial appendage resection, and maze procedure by resection of the anomalous septum in the left atrium. As a result, MR was controllable and AF disappeared after the operation. Although there is no established maze procedure with cor triatriatum, removing the septum was effective to complete it.  
Surgical aspects of valve replacement in carcinoid heart disease.  ;Tricuspid and pulmonary valve replacement in patients with advanced carcinoid heart disease (CaHD) reduces right heart failure and improves prognosis. The surgical literature is limited concerning description of technical aspects of valve replacement in CaHD. Although a dedicated multidisciplinary care is required for these frail patients, optimization of surgical technique is important and may lead to better postoperative outcomes.  
Iranian Society of Cardiac Surgeons COVID-19 task force version II, restarting elective surgeries.  ;Given the nature of heart disease and the importance of continuing heart surgery during the pandemic and its aftermath and in order to provide adequate safety for the surgical team and achieve the desired result for patients, as well as the optimal use of ICU beds, the medical team, blood, blood products, and personal protective equipment, it is essential to change the usual approach during the pandemic. There are still a lot of evidences and experiences needed to produce the perfect protocol. Some centers may have a special program for their centers during this period of epidemics that can be respected and performed. Generally, in pandemic conditions, the use of non-surgical approaches is preferred if similar outcomes can be obtained.  
Haemodynamic determinants of improved aerobic capacity after tricuspid valve surgery in Ebstein anomaly.  ;"BACKGROUND: Although tricuspid valve surgery improves functional capacity in patients with Ebstein anomaly, it is not always associated with improvement in aerobic capacity. The purpose of this study was to identify the determinants of improved aerobic capacity after tricuspid valve surgery in adults with Ebstein anomaly with severe tricuspid regurgitation. METHODS: Retrospective study of patients with severe tricuspid regurgitation due to Ebstein anomaly that had tricuspid valve surgery at Mayo Clinic Rochester (2000-2019) and had preoperative and postoperative cardiopulmonary exercise tests and echocardiograms. The patients were divided into aerobic capacity(+) and aerobic capacity(-) groups depending on whether they had postoperative improvement in %-predicted peak oxygen consumption (VO2). RESULTS: Of 76 patients with severe tricuspid regurgitation due to Ebstein anomaly, 28 (37%) and 48 (63%) were in aerobic capacity(+) and aerobic capacity(-) groups, respectively. The average improvement in peak VO2 was 2.1±1.4 mL/kg/min and -0.9±0.4 mL/kg/min in the in aerobic capacity(+) and aerobic capacity(-) groups, respectively. Although both groups had similar severity of residual tricuspid regurgitation, the aerobic capacity(+) group had more postoperative improvement in right atrial (RA) function, left atrial (LA) function and left ventricular preload and stroke volume. Of the preoperative variables analysed, RA reservoir strain (relative risk 1.12; 95% CI 1.06 to 1.18); LA reservoir strain (relative risk 1.09; 95% CI 1.04 to 1.14) and LV stroke volume index (OR 1.04; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.07) were predictors of postoperative improvement in peak VO2. CONCLUSIONS: One-third of patients with severe tricuspid regurgitation due to Ebstein anomaly had postoperative improvement in aerobic capacity, and atrial function indices were the best predictors of postoperative improvement in aerobic capacity. These data provide new insight into the haemodynamic determinants of exercise capacity and lay the foundation for further studies to determine whether postoperative improvement in aerobic capacity translates to improved long-term survival, and whether timing of tricuspid valve surgery based on these echocardiographic indices will improve long-term outcomes.

Impact of opioid use disorders on outcomes and readmission following cardiac operations.  ;OBJECTIVE: While opioid use disorder (OUD) has been previously associated with increased morbidity and resource use in cardiac operations, its impact on readmissions is understudied. METHODS: Patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting and valve repair or replacement, excluding infective endocarditis, were identified in the 2010-16 Nationwide Readmissions Database. Using International Classification of Diseases 9/10, we tabulated OUD and other characteristics. Multivariable regression was used to adjust for differences. RESULTS: Of an estimated 1 978 276 patients who had cardiac surgery, 5707 (0.3%) had OUD. During the study period, the prevalence of OUD increased threefold (0.15% in 2010 vs 0.53% in 2016, parametric trend<0.001). Patients with OUD were more likely to be younger (54.0 vs 66.0 years, p<0.001), insured by Medicaid (28.2 vs 6.2%, p<0.001) and of the lowest income quartile (33.6 vs 27.1%, p<0.001). After multivariable adjustment, OUD was associated with decreased mortality (1.5 vs 2.7%, p=0.001). Although these patients had similar rates of overall complications (36.1 vs 35.1%, p=0.363), they had increased thromboembolic (1.3 vs 0.8%, p<0.001) and infectious (4.1 vs 2.8%, p<0.001) events, as well as readmission at 30 days (19.0 vs 13.2%, p<0.001). While patients with OUD had similar hospitalisation costs ($50 766 vs $50 759, p=0.994), they did have longer hospitalisations (11.4 vs 10.3 days, p<0.001). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of OUD among cardiac surgical patients has steeply increased over the past decade. Although the presence of OUD was not associated with excess mortality at index hospitalisation, it was predictive of 30-day readmission. Increased attention to predischarge interventions and care coordination may improve outcomes in this population.  
Clinical impact of mitral calcium volume in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation.  ;"BACKGROUND: Mitral annular calcification (MAC) has been associated with mitral valve (MV) disease and cardiovascular events in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). We aimed to investigate the incidence and impact of mitral calcium volume (MCV) quantified by multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) on MV function and clinical outcomes after TAVI. METHODS: Consecutive patients with exploitable echocardiography and MDCT performed during TAVI screening were enrolled in this retrospective analysis. Mitral calcium was assessed visually and measured using a semi-automatic tool developed for the aortic valve in an off-label fashion. RESULTS: MCV >0 mm3 was found in 65% of the 875 included patients. Patients with calcification were older (82 ± 6 versus 81 ± 7; P = 0.002) and had high prevalence of renal dysfunction (69% versus 61%; P = 0.017) and mitral stenosis (25% versus 4%, P < 0.001). MCV correlated well with visual MAC severity (r = 0.94; P < 0.001), but showed a greater predictive value for mitral stenosis (AUC = 0.804 vs. 0.780, P = 0.012) , while it was not a predictor of mitral regurgitation (AUC = 0.514). Correlations were found between MCV and echocardiographic parameters including MV area, mean transmitral gradient, and pressure half-time (P < 0.001 for all). MCV did not impact on cardiovascular mortality or new permanent pacemaker implantation after TAVI. CONCLUSIONS: Calcification of the mitral apparatus is common in TAVI candidates and results in mitral stenosis in 25% of the patients. Increasing MCV predicts mitral stenosis, but had no impact on clinical outcomes following TAVI. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT01368250.  "
Polymyxin B-induced rhabdomyolysis: A case report.  ;RATIONALE: Polymyxin B has been used to treat extensively drug-resistant gram-negative bacteria and shown a better antibacterial effect in the clinic at present. Meanwhile, polymyxin B is associated with several adverse effects. However, there is a lack of awareness that polymyxin B can cause rhabdomyolysis. In this study, we firstly report a case of polymyxin B-induced rhabdomyolysis during antiinfection therapy. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 70-year-old woman suffering from rheumatic heart disease underwent aortic and mitral valve replacement at our institute. Subsequently, she developed bacteremia and pneumonia caused by extensively drug resistance-acinetobacter baumannii. Polymyxin B was administered for 5 days. During treatment, the patient complained of muscle pain and limb weakness, and her serum creatine phosphokinase and myoglobin levels rose. DIAGNOSIS: The clinical symptoms and laboratory examination confirmed rhabdomyolysis, and polymyxin B-induced rhabdomyolysis was considered. INTERVENTION: We ceased polymyxin B treatment and monitored the patient daily. OUTCOMES: Serum creatine phosphokinase levels returned to normal, myoglobin levels decreased, and muscle pain was significantly alleviated after cessation of polymyxin B. We identified this as a case of polymyxin B-induced rhabdomyolysis. LESSONS: Here, we report the first reported case of rhabdomyolysis induced by polymyxin B administration. The awareness of rare adverse reaction helps ensure the clinical safety of polymyxin B treatment.  
"Fetal Diagnosis of Tetralogy of Fallot, Major Aortopulmonary Collateral Arteries, and an ""Inverted"" Pulmonary Valve Causing a Circular Shunt.  ";• Pulmonary blood supply is the main determinant of physiology in tetralogy of Fallot. • This case exhibits a highly abnormal pulmonary valve and blood flow pattern. • Circular shunting may spare fetal health yet lead to neonatal hypoxemia and shock. • Surgical intervention stabilizes pulmonary blood supply in this unusual physiology. • Comparison is made with known subtypes of tetralogy of Fallot.  
Diagnosis of Persistent Left Superior Vena Cava: Lessons Learned from a Recurrent Stroke Case.  ;• Adults with congenital heart disease have a high incidence of stroke. • Agitated saline administration via the left upper extremity was used to detect PLSVC. • Cardiac MRI was used to accurately diagnose PLSVC. • Bicuspid aortic valve can coexist in patients with PLSVC.  
Clinical, Echocardiographic Characteristics and Management Practices in Patients with Rheumatic Valvular Heart Disease.  ;BACKGROUND: Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) is the long-term consequence of acute rheumatic fever (ARF), continues unabated among middle-income and low-income countries. Thus, this study aimed to assess clinical characteristics, echocardiographic characteristics, and management practice of RHD patients. METHODS: Hospital-based prospective cross-sectional study was used. The data were collected from medical records of consecutive patients admitted to medical wards during the study period. The data were cleaned and analyzed using SPSS version 20. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the data. Chi-square was used to compare proportions between categorical variables. RESULTS: Forty-seven patients with a median (IQR) age of 28.0 (17.0-40.0) years were included. Pan systolic murmur was reported in 91.50% of patients. Forty-two (89.4%) of patients were presented with congestive heart failure and 23 (48.9%) with atrial fibrillation. Mitral valve leaflet thickening and calcification with restriction of motion were reported in 91.5% of patients. Mitral regurgitation (MR) (87.2%) and stenosis (MS) (85.1%) were the most common valvular lesions. The combinations of three (MR+MS+TR) 14 (29.8%) and four (MR+MS+TR+AR) 13 (27.7%) valve diseases were most commonly reported. Diuretics (95.7%), anticoagulants (38.3%), digoxin (36.2%), and beta-blockers (34.0%) were among the commonly prescribed medications. CONCLUSION: Rheumatic heart disease affected younger adults. Pansystolic murmur was reported in nearly all patients. Congestive heart failure and atrial fibrillation were common clinical presentations. Morphologic changes in mitral valve and pathologic mitral regurgitation were the most common echocardiographic reports. Cardiovascular medications were commonly utilized for symptomatic management of complications Therefore, echocardiography should be done routinely for patients with RHD, focusing on younger adults, to facilitate diagnosis and treatment before complications develop.  
In-hospital outcomes and prevalence of comorbidities in patients with infective endocarditis with and without heart blocks: Insight from the National Inpatient Sample.  ;Infective endocarditis (IE) complicated by heart block can have adverse outcomes and usually requires immediate surgical and cardiac interventions. Data on outcomes and trends in patients with IE with concurrent heart block are lacking. Patients with a primary diagnosis of IE with or without heart block were identified by querying the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project database, specifically the National Inpatient Sample for the years 2013 and 2014, based on International Classification of Diseases Clinical Modification Ninth Revision codes. During 2013 and 2014, a total of 18,733 patients were admitted with a primary diagnosis of IE, including 867 with concurrent heart blocks. Increased in-hospital mortality (13% vs 10.3%), length of stay (19 vs 14 days), and cost of care ($282,573 vs $223,559) were found for patients with IE complicated by heart block. Additionally, these patients were more likely to develop cardiogenic shock (8.9% vs 3.2%), acute kidney injury (40.1% vs 32.6%), and hematologic complications (19.3% vs 15.2%), and require placement of a pacemaker (30.6% vs 0.9%). IE and concurrent heart block resulted in increased requirement for aortic (25.7% vs 6.1%) and mitral (17.3% vs 4.2%) valvular replacements. Conclusion was made that IE with concurrent heart block worsens in-hospital mortality, length of stay, and cost for patients. Our analysis demonstrates an increase in cardiac procedures, specifically aortic and/or mitral valve replacements, and Implantable Cardiovascular Defibrillator/Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy/ Permanent Pacemaker (ICD/CRT/PPM) placement in IE with concurrent heart block. A close telemonitoring system and prompt interventions may represent a significant mitigation strategy to avoid the adverse outcomes observed in this study.  
2020 Jeffrey M. Hoeg Award Lecture: Calcifying Extracellular Vesicles as Building Blocks of Microcalcifications in Cardiovascular Disorders.  ;Cardiovascular calcification is an insidious form of ectopic tissue mineralization that presents as a frequent comorbidity of atherosclerosis, aortic valve stenosis, diabetes, renal failure, and chronic inflammation. Calcification of the vasculature and heart valves contributes to mortality in these diseases. An inability to clinically image or detect early microcalcification coupled with an utter lack of pharmaceutical therapies capable of inhibiting or regressing entrenched and detectable macrocalcification has led to a prominent and deadly gap in care for a growing portion of our rapidly aging population. Recognition of this mounting concern has arisen over the past decade and led to a series of revolutionary works that has begun to pull back the curtain on the pathogenesis, mechanistic basis, and causative drivers of cardiovascular calcification. Central to this progress is the discovery that calcifying extracellular vesicles act as active precursors of cardiovascular microcalcification in diverse vascular beds. More recently, the omics revolution has resulted in the collection and quantification of vast amounts of molecular-level data. As the field has become poised to leverage these resources for drug discovery, new means of deriving relevant biological insights from these rich and complex datasets have come into focus through the careful application of systems biology and network medicine approaches. As we look onward toward the next decade, we envision a growing need to standardize approaches to study this complex and multifaceted clinical problem and expect that a push to translate mechanistic findings into therapeutics will begin to finally provide relief for those impacted by this disease.  
Mitral Valve Repair of Atrial Functional Mitral Regurgitation in Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction.  ;Our objective was to describe the long-term effects of endoscopic mitral valve (MV) repair on outcome in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and atrial functional mitral regurgitation (AFMR). In patients with HFpEF, even mild AFMR has been associated with poor outcome. The study population consisted of consecutive patients with HFpEF (left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ 50%, H2FPEF score ≥ 5) and AFMR, who underwent isolated, minimally invasive endoscopic MV repair (MVRepair group) (n = 131) or remained on standard of care (StanCare group) (n = 139). Patients with coronary artery disease or organic mitral regurgitation (MR) were excluded. Patients were matched using inverse probability of treatment weighting. Endpoints were all-cause mortality and a composite of all-cause mortality and HFpEF readmissions. The median follow-up was 5.03 years (interquartile range (IQR) 2.6-7.9 years). In the MVRepair group, the perioperative, 30-day, 1-year, and 5-year mortality were 0, 1%, 1%, and 12%, respectively. Additionally, 13 (10%) patients were readmitted for worsening HFpEF, while 2 (1%) individuals underwent redo MV surgery for recurrent MR. MVRepair compared with StanCare showed 21-29% (Standard Error (SE) 6-8%) and 19-26% (SE 6-8%) absolute risk reduction of all-cause mortality and HFpEF readmissions, respectively (all p < 0.05). MVRepair emerged as the strongest independent predictor of all-cause mortality (Hazard Ratio (HR) 0.16, 95% (Confidence Interval (CI) 0.07-0.34, p < 0.001) and HFpEF readmissions (HR 0.21, 95% CI 0.09-0.51, p < 0.001). At 5-year follow-up, in the MVRepair group, a total of 88% were alive and 80% were alive without readmission for HFpEF. We can conclude that endoscopic MV repair is associated with low perioperative mortality as well as high long-term efficacy, and appears to improve clinical outcome in patients with AFMR and HFpEF.  
Acute Kidney Injury after Heart Valve Surgery in Elderly Patients: any Risk Factors to Modify?  ;"INTRODUCTION: Postoperative acute kidney injury contributes to longer hospital stays and increased costs related to cardiac surgery in the elderly. We analyse the influence of the patient's age on risk factors for acute kidney injury after cardiac valve surgery. METHODS: We evaluated the prevalence and risk factors for acute kidney injury in 939 consecutive patients undergoing valve surgery, between 2013 and 2018. RESULTS: The prevalence of acute kidney injury was 19.5%. Hypertension (P=0.017); RR (95% CI): 1.74 (1.10-3.48), age ≥70 years (P=0.006); RR (95% CI): 1.79 (1.17-2.72), preoperative haematocrit <33% (P=0.009); RR (95% CI): 2.04 (1.19-3.48), glomerular filtration rate <60 ml/min/1.73 m2 (P<0.0001); RR (95%) CI: 2.36 (1.54-3.62) and cardiac catheterization <8 days before surgery (P=0.021); RR (95% CI): 2.15 (1.12-4.11) were identified as independent risk factors. In patients older than 70 years, with no kidney disease diagnosed preoperatively, glomerular filtration rate <70 ml/min/1.73 m2, male gender, cardiopulmonary bypass time, preoperative haematocrit <36% and preoperative therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors were risk factors for acute kidney injury after valve surgery. CONCLUSION: In elderly patients, postoperative acute kidney injury develops with higher values of preoperative glomerular filtration rate than those observed in a younger population. Preoperative correction of anaemia, discontinuation of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and surgical techniques reducing cardiopulmonary bypass time would be considered to reduce the prevalence of renal failure.

European heart health survey 2019.  ;BACKGROUND: Rising life expectancy in the western population is increasing the prevalence of heart valve diseases (HVD). HYPOTHESIS: The level of awareness and initial screening for HVD should be sufficient. The potential impact of HVD on the daily activities of the elderly population in Europe might affect our society. METHODS AND RESULTS: A survey was conducted, including a total of 12 832 people aged ≥ 60 years in 11 European countries. Of all the people surveyed, 5.6% could correctly describe aortic valve stenosis. Most participants (75.0%) claimed they regularly do activities like sports or social activities, 29.2% provide care for a family member, friend or acquaintance. The majority (69.2%) would be prevented from doing these activities by symptoms such as chest pain, fatigue or shortness of breath. Having chest pain (76.5%) and shortness of breath (57.8%) were reasons for most people to arrange an appointment with their GP, whereas only 26.2% would visit a GP for fatigue. 67.6% of respondents claimed to be checked with a stethoscope by their GP occasionally, never, or only when they ask. The preferred treatment option for HVD is a keyhole procedure (45.8%), whereas open heart surgery would only be preferred by 7.0%. CONCLUSION: Knowledge about HVD is still low. Neither appointments with a GP driven by symptoms nor regular use of a stethoscope are a reliable guarantee for early diagnosis. With the over 60s in Europe playing an active role in social life, awareness campaigns and regular heart health checks may guarantee early diagnosis and treatment of HVD.

Imaging characteristics and associations in twisted atrioventricular connections on multidetector computed tomography angiography.  ;AIM: To evaluate the imaging characteristics and associations in patients with twisted atrioventricular connections on multidetector computed tomography (CT) angiography. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 2605 CT angiography studies performed for suspected congenital heart diseases in our institution from January 2014 to December 2018. Twisted atrioventricular connections were diagnosed in 12 patients. Segmental sequential approach developed by Anderson et al was employed to characterize the complex congenital heart disease. Ventricular topology was also determined. CTA was also assessed to look for any associated intra- and extracardiac anomalies. RESULTS: Out of 12 patients with twisted atrioventricular connections, usual viscero-atrial arrangement was seen in nine patients, two patients had mirror-imaged viscero-atrial arrangement and one patient had mirror-imaged atrial arrangement. Right-sided heart was seen in four patients. Two patients had discordant atrioventricular connections, seven had concordant atrioventricular connections while three showed double-inlet right ventricle. Ventriculoarterial connections were concordant in two patients, discordant in one patient while nine patients had double-outlet right ventricle. Superior-inferior ventricular morphology with near-horizontal interventricular septum was seen in four patients. Left-sided aortic arch with normal branching pattern was observed in nine patients. No coronary anomaly was seen in any patient. Other associations included ventricular and atrial septal defects, pulmonic stenosis, hypoplasia/atresia of tricuspid valve, straddling of mitral valve, and duplicated superior caval veins. CONCLUSION: CT angiography is useful in diagnosis of twisted atrioventricular connections with accurate identification of viscero-atrial arrangement, atrioventricular and ventriculoarterial connections, and orientation and presence or absence of associated anomalies.  
Possible Susceptibility Genes for Intervention against Chemotherapy-Induced Cardiotoxicity.  ;Recent therapeutic advances have significantly improved the short- and long-term survival rates in patients with heart disease and cancer. Survival in cancer patients may, however, be accompanied by disadvantages, namely, increased rates of cardiovascular events. Chemotherapy-related cardiac dysfunction is an important side effect of anticancer therapy. While advances in cancer treatment have increased patient survival, treatments are associated with cardiovascular complications, including heart failure (HF), arrhythmias, cardiac ischemia, valve disease, pericarditis, and fibrosis of the pericardium and myocardium. The molecular mechanisms of cardiotoxicity caused by cancer treatment have not yet been elucidated, and they may be both varied and complex. By identifying the functional genetic variations responsible for this toxicity, we may be able to improve our understanding of the potential mechanisms and pathways of treatment, paving the way for the development of new therapies to target these toxicities. Data from studies on genetic defects and pharmacological interventions have suggested that many molecules, primarily those regulating oxidative stress, inflammation, autophagy, apoptosis, and metabolism, contribute to the pathogenesis of cardiotoxicity induced by cancer treatment. Here, we review the progress of genetic research in illuminating the molecular mechanisms of cancer treatment-mediated cardiotoxicity and provide insights for the research and development of new therapies to treat or even prevent cardiotoxicity in patients undergoing cancer treatment. The current evidence is not clear about the role of pharmacogenomic screening of susceptible genes. Further studies need to done in chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity.  
E3 Ubiquitin ligase NEDD4 family‑regulatory network in cardiovascular disease.  ;Protein ubiquitination represents a critical modification occurring after translation. E3 ligase catalyzes the covalent binding of ubiquitin to the protein substrate, which could be degraded. Ubiquitination as an important protein post-translational modification is closely related to cardiovascular disease. The NEDD4 family, belonging to HECT class of E3 ubiquitin ligases can recognize different substrate proteins, including PTEN, ENaC, Nav1.5, SMAD2, PARP1, Septin4, ALK1, SERCA2a, TGFβR3 and so on, via the WW domain to catalyze ubiquitination, thus participating in multiple cardiovascular-related disease such as hypertension, arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, heart failure, cardiotoxicity, cardiac hypertrophy, myocardial fibrosis, cardiac remodeling, atherosclerosis, pulmonary hypertension and heart valve disease. However, there is currently no review comprehensively clarifying the important role of NEDD4 family proteins in the cardiovascular system. Therefore, the present review summarized recent studies about NEDD4 family members in cardiovascular disease, providing novel insights into the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease. In addition, assessing transgenic animals and performing gene silencing would further identify the ubiquitination targets of NEDD4. NEDD4 quantification in clinical samples would also constitute an important method for determining NEDD4 significance in cardiovascular disease.  
Stroke prevention strategies in high-risk patients with atrial fibrillation.  ;Effective stroke prevention with oral anticoagulation (OAC) is the cornerstone of the management of patients with atrial fibrillation. The use of OAC reduces the risk of stroke and death. For most patients with atrial fibrillation without moderate or severe mitral valve stenosis or prosthetic mechanical heart valves, treatment options include vitamin K antagonists, such as warfarin, and non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs). Although most guidelines generally recommend NOACs as the first-line OAC, caution is required in some groups of patients with atrial fibrillation at high risk of stroke and bleeding who have been under-represented or not studied in the randomized clinical trials on NOACs for stroke prevention. In addition to OAC, non-pharmacological, percutaneous therapies, including left atrial appendage occlusion, for stroke prevention have emerged, sometimes used in combination with catheter ablation for the treatment of the atrial fibrillation. High-risk groups of patients with atrial fibrillation include patients with end-stage renal failure (including those receiving dialysis), extremely old patients (such as those aged >80 years with multiple risk factors for bleeding), patients with dementia or those living in a long-term care home, patients with previous intracranial bleeding or recent acute bleeding (such as gastrointestinal bleeding), patients with acute ischaemic stroke and patients with an intracardiac thrombus. This Review provides an overview of stroke prevention strategies, including left atrial appendage occlusion, in patients with atrial fibrillation at high risk of stroke and bleeding.

Long-term outcomes of rheumatic mitral valve repair: Is it worthwhile to do it?  ;"AIM: This retrospective study was undertaken to evaluate the long-term outcomes of mitral valve repair in rheumatic patients. METHODS: From 2003 to 2019, 151 patients (mean age 26.5 ± 14.9 years; 68.9% female) underwent mitral valve repair. Fifty-three (35.1%) had atrial fibrillation, and 79 (52.3%) were in New York Heart Association class III/IV. Pure mitral regurgitation was present in 109 (72.2%) patients, pure stenosis in 9 (6%), and mixed regurgitation and stenosis in 33. RESULTS: Three (2%) patients died postoperatively and 4 (2.6%) were lost during follow-up. Mean follow-up was 90.5 ± 55.6 months. There were 22 (14.8%) late deaths. Actuarial survival at 5, 10, and 15 years was 90.7% ± 2.5%, 83.5% ± 3.6%, and 76.5 ± 6.1%, respectively. Twelve (8.5%) patients underwent reoperation. Freedom from reoperation at 5, 10, and 15 years was 96.1% ± 1.7%, 89.8% ± 3.2%, and 82.3% ± 6.1%, respectively. Forty-two (29.2%) patients developed recurrent mitral regurgitation. Freedom from recurrence of mitral regurgitation at 5, 10, and 15 years was 70.9% ± 4.3%, 56% ± 5.9%, and 53.3% ± 6.4%, respectively. Eighty-one (56.6%) patients were and free from all events during follow-up. Freedom from all events at 5, 10, and 15 years was 64.8% ± 4.1%, 48.6% ± 5.3%, and 43.7% ± 5.8%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Although rheumatic mitral valve repair is associated with late recurrence of mitral regurgitation, it has benefits in selected patients, especially children and young patients who want to avoid the lifelong risks of anticoagulation. Long-term follow-up is essential in these patients.  "
Inhaled versus intravenous milrinone in mitral stenosis with pulmonary hypertension.  ;OBJECTIVE: To evaluate and compare the hemodynamic effects of intraoperative intravenous milrinone versus inhalational milrinone at two timepoints in patients with severe pulmonary hypertension undergoing mitral valve surgery. METHODS: A prospective observational study was performed in 100 patients with severe rheumatic mitral stenosis (with/without regurgitation) and right ventricular systolic pressure > 50 mm Hg. They were divided into two groups based on the strategy used to reduce pulmonary hypertension. Fifty patients had inhalational milrinone after sternotomy until initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass and after release of the aortic crossclamp until weaning off cardiopulmonary bypass. The other 50 patients received an intravenous loading dose of milrinone 50 µg·kg-1 over 10 min on release of the aortic crossclamp. Both groups received intravenous milrinone 0.5 µg·kg-1 during weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass. Hemodynamic data were evaluated at the 3 timepoints. RESULTS: Pulmonary artery pressures, central venous pressure, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure decreased significantly in the inhalational milrinone group compared to the intravenous milrinone group. Systemic vascular resistance index and cardiac index were significantly higher and pulmonary vascular resistance index was significantly lower in the inhalational milrinone group. The mean arterial pressure-to-mean pulmonary artery pressure ratio was significantly lower in the intravenous milrinone group. Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion and right ventricular fractional area change were increased significantly in the inhalational milrinone group. CONCLUSION: Intraoperative inhalational milrinone before and after cardiopulmonary bypass is safe, easy to administer, and results in significant improvements in right ventricular hemodynamics, right ventricular function, and systemic hemodynamics.  
Supracardiac total anomalous pulmonary venous connection with cor triatriatum sinister: A rare diagnosis confirmed by saline contrast echocardiography.  ;In cor triatriatum sinister, the left atrium is divided by a membrane into a proximal and a distal chamber. Usually proximal chamber receives all the pulmonary veins and drains through an opening in the dividing membrane into distal chamber, which empties into left ventricle through the mitral valve. Rarely, the two chambers lack a communication and there is associated total anomalous pulmonary venous connection (TAPVC). We report a 1-month-old infant with cyanosis and heart failure, who had cor triatriatum sinister associated with supracardiac TAPVC. The case is reported for rarity of the association with a focus on contrast echocardiographic imaging.  
Hypoplasia of the posterior mitral valve leaflet: Don't forget to look beyond the mitral valve.  ;Hypoplasia of the posterior mitral valve leaflet (PMVL) is a very rare finding in adulthood and can coexist with other congenital heart defects. In this image, a transesophageal echocardiography (TOE) carried out on a 59-year-old woman with a 2-month history of dyspnea revealed a hypoplastic PMVL causing severe mitral regurgitation associated with a secundum-type atrial septal defect (ASD) with left-to-right shunting. This case demonstrates how essential 3-dimensional TOE is for a comprehensive assessment of the mitral valve and to improve the diagnostic accuracy of concomitant congenital heart abnormalities.

Risk Factors and Timing of Acute Myocardial Infarction Associated With Pregnancy: Insights From the National Inpatient Sample.  ;"Background Pregnancy increases the risk of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The purpose of this study was to examine timing and risk factors for AMI in pregnancy and poor outcome. Methods and Results National Inpatient Sample (2003-2015) was screened in pregnancy, labor and delivery, and postpartum. There were 11 297 849 records extracted with 913 instances of AMI (0.008%). One hundred eleven (12.2%) women experienced AMI during labor and delivery, 338 (37.0%) during pregnancy and most during the postpartum period (464; 50.8%). The prevalence of AMI in pregnancy has increased (P=0.0005). Most major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events occurred in the postpartum period (63.5%). Inpatient mortality was 4.5%. Predictors of AMI include known coronary artery disease (odds ratio [OR], 517.4; 95% CI, 420.8-636.2), heart failure (OR, 8.2; 95% CI, 1.9-35.2), prior valve replacement (OR, 6.4; 95% CI, 2.4-17.1), and atrial fibrillation (OR, 2.7; CI, 1.5-4.7; P<0.001). Risk factors of traditional atherosclerosis including hyperlipidemia, obesity, tobacco history, substance abuse, and thrombophilia were identified (P<0.001). Gestational hypertensive disorders (eclampsia OR, 6.0; 95% CI, 3.3-10.8; preeclampsia OR, 3.2; 95% CI, 2.5-4.2) were significant risk factors in predicting AMI. Risk factors associated with major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events included prior percutaneous coronary intervention (OR, 6.6; 95% CI, 1.4-31.2) and pre-eclampsia (OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.3-3.9). Conclusions AMI is associated with modifiable, nonmodifiable, and obstetric risk factors. These risk factors can lead to devastating adverse outcomes and highlight the need for risk factor modification and public health resource initiatives toward the goal of decreasing AMI in the pregnant population.

Isolated left atrial cryoablation of atrial fibrillation in conventional mitral valve surgery.  ;"BACKGROUND: Recent trends of surgery for atrial fibrillation (AF) are towards more safe and effective energy sources, as well as to simplified sets of atrial lesions. METHODS: One hundred eighteen (mean age, 67.4 ± 9.2 years) selected patients with paroxysmal/persistent AF and mitral valve (MV) disease underwent cryoablation of AF combined with conventional (not via mini-thoracotomy) MV surgery; the lesion set was limited to only the left atrium. Multivariable analyses identified predictors of cardiac rhythm at hospital discharge and follow-up. RESULTS: There were 7 (5.9%) hospital deaths; 33 (28%) patients were discharged on AF. Higher values of preoperative left atrial volume index (odds ratio [OR] = 1.07, 95% confidence interval [95%CI]: 1.01-1.13) and mixed etiology of MV disease (OR = 4.19, 95%CI: 1.23-14.2) were predictors of hospital discharge on AF. Seventy-four (66.7%) patients were on stable sinus rhythm at follow-up (median period, 6.6 years); the 1, 5, and 10-year nonparametric estimates of adjusted freedom from AF were 98.1%, 89.2% and 45.6%, respectively. Higher values of preoperative systolic pulmonary artery pressure (hazard ratio [HR] = HR = 1.04, 95%CI: 1.01-1.08) and AF at hospital discharge (HR = 4.14, 95%CI: 1.50-11.4) were predictors of AF at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: During conventional MV surgery, a cryo-lesion set limited to only the left atrium may give good, immediate and long-term results. Left atrial dilation and mixed etiology of MV disease were predictors of hospital discharge on AF. Preoperative pulmonary hypertension and AF at discharge combined with an increased risk of AF at follow-up.  "
History, development and clinical perspectives of sutureless and rapid deployment surgical aortic valve replacement.  ;Degenerative aortic stenosis is the most frequent valvular heart disease in industrialized countries. Conservative treatment may beneficially influence symptoms but is never successful. Surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) was the only recognized treatment option to provide substantially prolonged survival until 2008. Operative mortality of isolated SAVR has been reported as low as 0.5% to 1% in experienced institutions, while long-term survival is close to that observed in a control healthy population of similar age. A multitude of studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of SAVR with regard to improvement in quality of life and physical performance in the majority of symptomatic patients. In the last decade, transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has emerged as an equal treatment modality, first in patients with high surgical risk and more recently in patients with intermediate and low surgical risk. Paravalvular regurgitation and the higher rate of pacemaker implantation remain points of consideration. Additionally, the long-term durability of TAVI devices and occurrence of stroke late after TAVI require additional analyses. Sutureless (SU-SAVR) and rapid deployment valve (R-SAVR) were designed to simplify and accelerate a conventional or less invasive surgical procedure while allowing complete excision of the calcified native valve. From 3 different implants tested more than 10 to 15 years ago, only two are available on the market today: the Perceval® valve from Liva Nova and the Intuity® sutureless prosthesis from Edwards Lifesciences. There has been extensive experience with these two devices in previous years and the results obtained are comparable to those observed following the use of conventional implants. The sutureless devices may be of particular interest for more complex and combined surgical procedures. This review summarizes the sutureless (SU-SAVR) and rapid deployment valve technologies and presents a clinical outlook for the patient population managed with these devices.  
Sutureless valve and rapid deployment valves: a systematic review and meta-analysis of comparative studies.  ;"BACKGROUND: The treatment of aortic valve disease is the most common valvular surgery in industrialized nations, with 3-9% of the population over the age of eighty having at least moderate aortic stenosis. As transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has become more established, newer surgical prostheses have been developed with a variety of anchoring systems that do not rely solely on sutures to hold the valve in an appropriate position. The Edwards Intuity valve is a bovine pericardial prosthesis that is modelled on the widely implanted Perimount MagnaEase aortic prosthesis. The Perceval valve is a bovine pericardial valve attached to a self-expanding nitinol stent, which uses the radial force exerted on the patient's aortic annulus and aortic root by the stent portion to hold the valve in position. This meta-analysis compares the outcomes of comparative studies of these two valve systems. METHODS: This systematic review and meta-analysis compares the outcomes of rapid deployment valves (RDV) and sutureless valves (SURD) and was performed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) recommendations and guidance. The search strategy interrogated six electronic databases. Outcomes measured included all-cause mortality at latest follow up, stroke, cross-clamp and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) times, pacemaker implantation rates, paravalvular leak and post-operative transvalvular gradient. RESULTS: The search strategy identified 407 unique papers for initial assessment with seven studies qualifying for inclusion in the analysis. The outcomes of 4,076 patients (1,650 RDV, 2,426 SURD) were included. There was no difference in mortality, stroke or moderate or worse paravalvular regurgitation between the two groups. SURD had significantly shorter CPB time by 15.7 minutes [95% confidence interval (CI): 4.2-27.1; P=0.007] and a shorter cross-clamp time by 11.3 minutes (95% CI: 6.3-16.3; P<0.001) compared to RDV. RDV had a lower post-operative transvalvular gradient by 2.5 mmHg (95% CI: 1.2-3.8; P<0.001) and a lower rate of mild paravalvular regurgitation (OR 2.51; 95% CI: 1.435-4.768; P=0.004). CONCLUSIONS: Both valve types have an adequate safety profile and are comparable to conventional sutured prostheses. There was a significant reduction in cross-clamp and CPB times associated with SURD. This may be of benefit for patients requiring multiple concomitant procedures and increases the utility of minimally invasive valve replacement. However, SURD was associated with higher post-operative transvalvular gradients and a higher incidence of paravalvular regurgitation.  "
Cardiac manifestations and effects of enzyme replacement therapy for over 10 years in adults with the attenuated form of mucopolysaccharidosis type I.  ;BACKGROUND: Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) is a rare autosomal recessive disease caused by a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme α-L-iduronidase. Cardiac manifestations such as valvular heart disease are associated with poor prognosis. There have been only a few reports on the effect of long-term enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for adult patients with the attenuated form of MPS I (Scheie syndrome) and cardiac involvement. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed four adult patients of Scheie syndrome for which ERT was performed in our hospital. We investigated the findings of electrocardiography and echocardiography for the four patients performed before and 10 years after the initiation of ERT to evaluate the efficacy for ERT in Scheie syndrome. RESULTS: The ages of the patients at the initiation of ERT ranged from 26 to 46 years. The mean follow-up period was 129 months (121 to 134 months). Two patients underwent valve replacement surgery before the initiation of ERT. One patient had gradual progressive aortic valve stenosis and mitral valve stenosis during the course of ERT, and double valve replacement was finally performed. The patient who had started ERT at the youngest age did not develop significant cardiovascular disease. Regarding clinical courses with ERT for a period of 10 years, all four patients survived and they showed relatively stable cardiac conditions although two patients developed sick sinus syndrome after the valvular surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Valvular disease in patients with Scheie syndrome occur at a young age. In a limited number of the four patients, ERT might contribute the stability of cardiac condition.  
"When a multipolar catheter misses an ""arm"": A known complication experienced anew.  ";DOI: 10.1016/j.hrcr.2020.07.013 PMCID: PMC7573382 PMID: 33101946  
A Clinical Challenge in the Emergency Department: A Case of Klebsiella Infective Endocarditis Presenting With Splenic Abscess.  ;Infective endocarditis (IE) is a serious bacterial infection of the endocardium and/or heart valves that carries considerable morbidity and mortality. Often presenting with very non-specific symptoms, this disease presents many challenges to the emergency medicine practitioner. A 47-year-old male with no pertinent medical history presented to the emergency department complaining of shortness of breath. He stated that his symptoms had been persistent for the last three weeks and were associated with malaise and fatigue. CT of the abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast revealed a 7-cm hypodensity of the spleen concerning for abscess versus infarct. He denied any trauma or IV drug use. Follow-up ultrasound was ordered, which characterized the hypodensity as a splenic abscess. An echocardiogram was recommended for possible IE, and cardiology was consulted. The transthoracic echocardiogram was performed on hospital day 2, which showed minimal mitral valve thickening with mild mitral regurgitation. The interventional radiology (IR) service was consulted for the splenic abscess in order to perform CT-guided drainage. An IR drain was successfully placed on hospital day 3. On the same day, blood cultures grew Klebsiella pneumoniae. On hospital day 5, that patient was transferred to the ICU for possible empyema formation with signs of respiratory distress. The patient underwent CT of the chest that showed the development of a left-sided effusion. The patient had also been persistently tachycardic and febrile, with high leukocytosis since admission and worsening respiratory status. Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) was scheduled but put on hold due to worsening respiratory status. Repeat TEE was scheduled five days later, which showed mitral regurgitation and increased size of the vegetation despite antibiotic therapy. Two days later, he was scheduled for mitral valve repair. When reviewing our case, the patient had both common and uncommon aspects of splenic abscess or IE. First, despite having respiratory symptoms for two weeks, the primary reason he came to the hospital was due to the new onset of fevers. He was febrile, tachycardic, and with significant leukocytosis. He continued to have fevers despite antibiotic therapy and IR drainage of the abscess. With no history of IV drug use history, negative transthoracic echocardiography, lack of immunocompromising condition, and blood cultures with gram-negative rods, IE became less likely of a diagnosis.  Establishing the diagnosis of IE proved to be exceptionally complicated, especially in the setting of a COVID-19 pandemic. The most notable challenge was having a high index of suspicion despite any risk factors. The patient was a previously healthy 47-year-old male with no medical problems. IE continues to be a clinical challenge for physicians, especially in the emergency department, due to the lack of diagnostic criteria such as positive blood cultures or vegetations visualized on echocardiographic studies. IE has a wide gamut of presentations with different levels of acuity. Diagnosis is more straightforward when patients present with obvious risk factors, but, in many cases, such as this one, those risk factors may be absent. A high index of suspicion is required, especially in patients with additional findings such as splenic abscess, embolic phenomenon, focal neurologic deficit, mycotic aneurysm, decompensated heart failure, new murmurs, or pleural effusions.  
Left heart hypoplasia operated using double pulmonary arterial banding with double arterial duct stenting: A case report.  ;"Hypoplastic left heart syndrome is a heterogeneous group of congenital cardiac malformations which associates hypoplastic/aplastic left ventricle, mitral and aortic valve, hypoplastic/atresia and severe aortic artery coarctation, and represents a medical-surgical emergency. We present a case of a newborn hospitalised in three clinics (two clinics from Timisoara and one from Vienna), and operated for hypoplastic left heart syndrome, without aortic coarctation, using a mixed technique cardiovascular repair surgery. The initial therapeutic conduct included maintaining the permeability of the arterial canal with prostaglandin E1. At the Vienna General Hospital, at the age of 17 days, bilateral banding of the pulmonary artery was performed and, at the age of 20 days, during the cardiac catheterisation, the Rashkind procedure (balloon atrial septostomy) was performed, with two stents being implanted in the arterial canal. Postoperative complications were postcardiotomy syndrome, pneumonia with Enterococcus faecalis and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, sepsis with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, coagulopathy, mixed anaemia, and metabolic acidosis. The patient died 1 month after the intervention due to cardiorespiratory arrest, bilateral congestive heart failure, left heart hypoplasia with shunt through the arterial canal and pulmonary artery banding, multiorgan failure, and severe secondary haemorrhagic disease. In conclusion, the initial cardiac surgical reconstruction consisted of a mixed technique, and anticoagulant medical treatment with heparin, antibiotics (bacterial endocarditis prophylaxis to be performed throughout life); postintervention hypoxic and infectious complications resulted in multiorgan failure and death.

Expression of Calcification and Extracellular Matrix Genes in the Cardiovascular System of the Healthy Domestic Sheep (Ovis aries).  ;The maintenance of a healthy cardiovascular system requires expression of genes that contribute to essential biological activities and repression of those that are associated with functions likely to be detrimental to cardiovascular homeostasis. Vascular calcification is a major disruption to cardiovascular homeostasis, where tissues of the cardiovascular system undergo ectopic calcification and consequent dysfunction, but little is known about the expression of calcification genes in the healthy cardiovascular system. Large animal models are of increasing importance in cardiovascular disease research as they demonstrate more similar cardiovascular features (in terms of anatomy, physiology and size) to humans than do rodent species. We used RNA sequencing results from the sheep, which has been utilized extensively to examine calcification of prosthetic cardiac valves, to explore the transcriptome of the heart and cardiac valves in this large animal, in particular looking at expression of calcification and extracellular matrix genes. We then examined genes implicated in the process of vascular calcification in a wide array of cardiovascular tissues and across multiple developmental stages, using RT-qPCR. Our results demonstrate that there is a balance between genes that promote and those that suppress mineralization during development and across cardiovascular tissues. We show extensive expression of genes encoding proteins involved in formation and maintenance of the extracellular matrix in cardiovascular tissues, and high expression of hematopoietic genes in the cardiac valves. Our analysis will support future research into the functions of implicated genes in the development of valve calcification, and increase the utility of the sheep as a large animal model for understanding ectopic calcification in cardiovascular disease. This study provides a foundation to explore the transcriptome of the developing cardiovascular system and is a valuable resource for the fields of mammalian genomics and cardiovascular research.  
Fallot type of absent pulmonary valve syndrome - A case report.  ;"Absent pulmonary valve syndrome (APVS) is a rare congenital cardiac malformation characterized by absent, dysplastic, or rudimentary pulmonary valve leaflets in association with other cardiac anomalies. It has an incidence of 3-6% in cases of tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) and 0.2-0.4% of live-born infants with congenital heart disease (CHD). Absent pulmonary valve leads to dilated main pulmonary artery; presenting as a pulsatile, paracardiac cystic lesion on antenatal ultrasound (USG). We report a case of this rare anomaly in association with ventricular septal defect (VSD), TOF, and left axis deviation of heart detected at 23 weeks of gestation.  "
Right mini-thoracotomy approach in patients undergoing redo mitral valve procedure.  ;AIM: A minimally invasive technique is an attractive option in cardiac surgery. In this study, we present our experience with minimally invasive cardiac surgery (MICS) via right mini-thoracotomy on patients undergoing mitral valve procedure as reoperation. METHODS: From 2017 until 2019, 20 patients underwent reoperation of the mitral valve through a right-sided mini-thoracotomy. Cardiopulmonary bypass was established through cannulation of the femoral vessels. All patients requiring isolated re-operative mitral valve surgery with suitable femoral vessels for cannulation were included in the study. Patients requiring concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or with peripheral artery disease were excluded. RESULTS: The mean age was 65 ± 12 years. The average log. EuroSCORE was 9 ± 5%. Ten patients with severe mitral valve regurgitation (MR) underwent re-repair of the mitral valve. Seven of them were post mitral valve repair (MVR), one was post aortic valve replacement (AVR), one had tricuspid valve repair, and one other patient had CABG before. Ten patients underwent mitral valve replacement due to mixed mitral valve disease (n = 9) or mitral valve endocarditis (n = 1). Eight patients were post MVR and 2 had AVR before. The mean time to reoperation was 7.5 ± 8 years. In-hospital mortality was 5% (n = 1). The mean cross clamp time was 54 ± 26 min. Postoperative echocardiography revealed competent valve function in all cases with mean ejection fraction of 55 ± 9%. The Kaplan-Meier 1- and 2-year survival was 95%. CONCLUSION: The MICS approach for mitral valve reoperation in selected patients seems to be safe and feasible. It is also a surgical option for high-risk patients.  
Comparison of the Bentall procedure versus valve-sparing aortic root replacement.  ;Bentall and valve-sparing root replacement (VSRR) procedures are established treatments for aortic root disease. We present a single-center retrospective analysis comparing outcomes of bioprosthetic Bentall (BB), mechanical Bentall (MB), and VSRR patients from November 2007 to October 2016. Survival analysis was performed to evaluate the composite endpoint of freedom from recurrent aortic insufficiency, reoperation, or death. Of the 170 patients, BB was performed in 36 patients, MB in 63 patients, and VSRR in 71 patients. For BB, MB, and VSRR, the mean age was 63.8, 45.5, and 49.2 years (P < 0.001), respectively. Additionally, significantly more patients in the MB group (n = 32, 50.8%, P < 0.001) than in the BB and VSRR groups had prior cardiac surgeries. Cardiopulmonary bypass time and cross-clamp time were significantly longer in the VSRR group (P = 0.04 and 0.0005, respectively). Despite the complexity of the procedure, VSRR patients had higher combined freedom from death and reoperation than patients in the BB or MB groups. Elective Bentall root replacement is an excellent option for patients with root disease. Patients undergoing Bentall tend to have more severe or emergent cases, making them unlikely candidates for VSRR. VSRR in experienced centers carries equivalent morbidity and mortality and improved survival.  
Hybrid intervention approach to coronary artery and valvular heart disease.  ;Coronary angiography is used to assess the burden of coronary artery disease prior to surgical valve repair/replacement and often leads to concomitant bypass and valve surgery. We sought to evaluate outcomes of an alternative, hybrid approach involving percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and valve surgery, assessing the rate of stent thrombosis as a primary outcome. We reviewed charts of consecutive patients who underwent planned PCI prior to surgical valve repair/replacement by a single surgeon from January 2008 to December 2016. We calculated rates of surgical complication, duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) prior to surgery, and rates of stent thrombosis and in-stent restenosis. Twenty-four patients were included in this study. Surgery was performed a median of 52.5 days following PCI. DAPT was withheld an average of 8 days before and resumed an average of 4 days after surgery. Ninety-two percent of surgeries were minimally invasive. There were no bleeding complications, stent thromboses, or restenosis events. All patients survived the 1-year follow-up. For patients with mixed coronary and valvular heart disease, a heart team approach involving preoperative PCI followed by staged minimally invasive valvular surgery appears to be safe and warrants further exploration.  
Long-Term Outcomes and Echocardiographic Data After Aortic Valve Replacement With a 17-mm Mechanical Valve.  ;BACKGROUND: We investigated the long-term clinical and hemodynamic outcomes after aortic valve replacement (AVR) with a 17-mm mechanical valve.Methods and Results:Between January 2005 and December 2011, 80 patients with aortic stenosis underwent AVR with the 17-mm St. Jude Medical Regent prosthetic valve. Echocardiography was performed preoperatively, at discharge, and at follow-up, which was performed at least 2 years postoperatively (median interval, 7.3 years). Prosthesis-patient mismatch (PPM) was defined as an indexed effective orifice area <0.85 cm2/m2at discharge and occurred in 25 patients (31%). The median follow-up period was 8.7 years (100% complete). Overall in-hospital mortality was 2.5% (2 patients) with 27 late deaths (34%). The 5- and 10-year survival rates were 78.7% and 63.0%, respectively. Peripheral arterial disease and concomitant mitral valve repair were independent predictors of late mortality. The 5- and 10-year freedom from major adverse valve-related events (MAVRE) rates were 91.6% and 83.5%, respectively. PPM at discharge did not affect long-term survival, freedom from MAVRE, or freedom from heart failure. Echocardiographic data at follow-up revealed a significant reduction in the mean left ventricular mass index (LVMI). LVMI reduction observed at follow-up was similar between patients with and without PPM. CONCLUSIONS: AVR with the 17-mm mechanical prosthesis had acceptable long-term clinical and hemodynamic outcomes. Significant reduction in LVMI was observed regardless of PPM.  
Correlations between lipoprotein(a) gene polymorphisms and calcific aortic valve disease and coronary heart disease in Han Chinese.  ;OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between lipoprotein(a) gene (LPA) polymorphisms and calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) and coronary heart disease (CHD) in Han Chinese. METHODS: A total of 148 patients were recruited (n = 71 with CAVD and n = 77 with CHD) based on a diagnosis achieved using color Doppler echocardiography, coronary angiography, or computed tomography angiography. Seventy-one control individuals without CAVD or CHD were also recruited. Biomarkers including levels of lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)], low-density lipoprotein and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoprotein A1, and apolipoprotein B were tested. LPA polymorphisms rs10455872, rs6415084, rs3798221, and rs7770628 were analyzed using SNaPshot SNP. RESULTS: Lp(a) levels were significantly higher in CAVD and CHD groups compared with controls. There was no significant difference in the allelic frequency distribution of rs3798221, rs7770628, or rs6415084 between CHD, CAVD, and control groups. Linear regression showed that rs3798221, rs7770628, and rs6415084 were associated with increased Lp(a) concentrations. Two CAVD patients among the 219 participants carried AG minor alleles at rs10455872, while the remainder carried AA minor alleles. CONCLUSION: rs3798221, rs6415084, and rs7770628 polymorphisms within LPA are associated with higher Lp(a) plasma levels, which correlate with increased CAVD and CHD risks.  
Left atrial thrombus formation within a few days of hospitalization in semi-acute ischemic heart disease despite no atrial fibrillation and mitral stenosis: a case report.  ;"BACKGROUND: Currently, the occurrence of left atrial thrombus despite the provision of heparinization within a few days of hospitalization without atrial fibrillation (AF) and mitral stenosis (MS) is rarely reported. CASE PRESENTATION: A 71-year-old woman presented with chest discomfort and dyspnea. Examination revealed ST elevation with sinus rhythm, congestive heart failure, and moderate mitral regurgitation (MR) by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). Diuretics, a coronary vasodilator, and unfractionated heparin (15,000 units/day) were administered. Four days after hospitalization, her C-reactive protein level had increased; therefore, TTE was repeated, revealing a thrombus in the left atrial appendage, which was probably affected by heparin resistance because of low antithrombin (49%). On day 5, the patient underwent emergency removal of the thrombus, mitral valve replacement, and coronary artery bypass. CONCLUSION: Patients can exhibit low left ventricular contractility, even sinus rhythm without MS. Thus, TTE and subsequent coagulation tests including antithrombin must be performed to prevent thrombus.  "
A method for simultaneously crosslinking and functionalizing extracellular matrix-based biomaterials as bioprosthetic heart valves with enhanced endothelialization and reduced inflammation.  ;With the coming of an aging society and the emergence of transcatheter valve technology, the implantation of bioprosthetic heart valves (BHVs) in patients with valvular disease has significantly increased worldwide. Currently, most clinically available BHVs are crosslinked with glutaraldehyde (GLUT). However, the GLUT treated BHV is less durable due to the combined effect of multiple factors such as cytotoxicity, immune responses, and calcification. In this study, the in-situ polymerization of sulfonic monomers with a decellularized extracellular matrix (ECM) was performed to simultaneously achieve the crosslinking and functionalization of ECM. Subsequently, the feasibility of the hybrid ECM used as leaflet material of BHV was evaluated. In in-vitro tests, the results indicated that the hybrid ECM fixed collagen efficiently and the introduction of sulfonic polymer promoted the proliferation and migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). In in-vivo tests, after being implanted in SD rats and mice, the hybrid ECM significantly inhibited immune response and calcification compared with the non-hybrid counterpart and GLUT crosslinked tissue. These results indicated that the hybrid ECM exhibited more competitive stability and better biocompatibility compared to these features in GLUT-crosslinked valve. Therefore, the sulfonic polymer hybrid ECM provides a potential material for more durable BHV and the in-situ polymerization strategy can serve as a general treatment method for tissue crosslinking as well as tailoring the biophysical properties of ECM.  
Interactive editing of virtual chordae tendineae for the simulation of the mitral valve in a decision support system.  ;PURPOSE: Decision support systems for mitral valve disease are an important step toward personalized surgery planning. A simulation of the mitral valve apparatus is required for decision support. Building a model of the chordae tendineae is an essential component of a mitral valve simulation. Due to image quality and artifacts, the chordae tendineae cannot be reliably detected in medical imaging. METHODS: Using the position-based dynamics framework, we are able to realistically simulate the opening and closing of the mitral valve. Here, we present a heuristic method for building an initial chordae model needed for a successful simulation. In addition to the heuristic, we present an interactive editor to refine the chordae model and to further improve pathology reproduction as well as geometric approximation of the closed valve. RESULTS: For evaluation, five mitral valves were reconstructed based on image sequences of patients scheduled for mitral valve surgery. We evaluated the approximation of the closed valves using either just the heuristic chordae model or a manually refined model. Using the manually refined models, prolapse was correctly reproduced in four of the five cases compared to two of the five cases when using the heuristic. In addition, using the editor improved the approximation in four cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our approach is suitable to create realistically parameterized mitral valve apparatus reconstructions for the simulation of normally and abnormally closing valves in a decision support system.  
Elevated high-sensitivity troponin T levels at 1-year follow-up are associated with increased long-term mortality after TAVR.  ;BACKGROUND: Elevated pre-procedural high-sensitivity troponin T (hs-TnT) levels predict adverse outcomes in patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). It is unknown whether elevated troponin levels still provide prognostic information during follow-up after successful TAVR. We evaluated the long-term implications of elevated hs-TnT levels found at 1-year post-TAVR. METHODS AND RESULTS: The study included 349 patients who underwent TAVR for severe AS from 2010-2019 and for whom 1-year hs-TnT levels were available. Any required percutaneous coronary interventions were performed > 1 week before TAVR. The primary endpoint was survival time starting at 1-year post-TAVR. Optimal hs-TnT cutoff for stratifying risk, identified by ROC analysis, was 39.4 pg/mL. 292 patients had hs-TnT < 39.4 pg/mL (median 18.3 pg/mL) and 57 had hs-TnT ≥ 39.4 pg/mL (median 51.2 pg/mL). The high hs-TnT group had a higher median N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) level, greater left ventricular (LV) mass, higher prevalence of severe diastolic dysfunction, LV ejection fraction < 35%, severe renal dysfunction, and more men compared with the low hs-TnT group. All-cause mortality during follow-up after TAVR was significantly higher among patients who had hs-TnT ≥ 39.4 pg/mL compared with those who did not (mortality rate at 2 years post-TAVR: 12.3% vs. 4.1%, p = 0.010). Multivariate analysis identified 1-year hs-TnT ≥ 39.4 pg/mL (hazard ratio 2.93, 95% CI 1.91-4.49, p < 0.001), NT-proBNP level > 300 pg/mL, male sex, an eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as independent risk factors for long-term mortality after TAVR. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated hs-TnT concentrations at 1-year after TAVR were associated with a higher long-term mortality.

Myocardial disease and ventricular arrhythmia in Marfan syndrome: a prospective study.  ;"BACKGROUND: Aortic root dilatation and-dissection and mitral valve prolapse are established cardiovascular manifestations in Marfan syndrome (MFS). Heart failure and arrhythmic sudden cardiac death have emerged as additional causes of morbidity and mortality. METHODS: To characterize myocardial dysfunction and arrhythmia in MFS we conducted a prospective longitudinal case-control study including 86 patients with MFS (55.8% women, mean age 36.3 yr-range 13-70 yr-) and 40 age-and sex-matched healthy controls. Cardiac ultrasound, resting and ambulatory ECG (AECG) and NT-proBNP measurements were performed in all subjects at baseline. Additionally, patients with MFS underwent 2 extra evaluations during 30 ± 7 months follow-up. To study primary versus secondary myocardial involvement, patients with MFS were divided in 2 groups: without previous surgery and normal/mild valvular function (MFS-1; N = 55) and with previous surgery or valvular dysfunction (MFS-2; N = 31). RESULTS: Compared to controls, patients in MFS-1 showed mild myocardial disease reflected in a larger left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD), lower TAPSE and higher amount of (supra) ventricular extrasystoles [(S)VES]. Patients in MFS-2 were more severely affected. Seven patients (five in MFS-2) presented decreased LV ejection fraction. Twenty patients (twelve in MFS-2) had non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) in at least one AECG. Larger LVEDD and higher amount of VES were independently associated with NSVT. CONCLUSION: Our study shows mild but significant myocardial involvement in patients with MFS. Patients with previous surgery or valvular dysfunction are more severely affected. Evaluation of myocardial function with echocardiography and AECG should be considered in all patients with MFS, especially in those with valvular disease and a history of cardiac surgery.  "
Shear Stress-Induced Activation of von Willebrand Factor and Cardiovascular Pathology.  ;The von Willebrand factor (vWF) is a plasma protein that mediates platelet adhesion and leukocyte recruitment to vascular injury sites and carries coagulation factor VIII, a building block of the intrinsic pathway of coagulation. The presence of ultra-large multimers of vWF in the bloodstream is associated with spontaneous thrombosis, whereas its deficiency leads to bleeding. In cardiovascular pathology, the progression of the heart valve disease results in vWF deficiency and cryptogenic gastrointestinal bleeding. The association between higher plasma levels of vWF and thrombotic complications of coronary artery disease was described. Of note, it is not the plasma levels that are crucial for vWF hemostatic activity, but vWF activation, triggered by a rise in shear rates. vWF becomes highly reactive with platelets upon unfolding into a stretched conformation, at shear rates above the critical value (more than 5000 s-1), which might occur at sites of arterial stenosis and injury. The activation of vWF and its counterbalance by ADAMTS-13, the vWF-cleaving protease, might contribute to complications of cardiovascular diseases. In this review, we discuss vWF involvement in complications of cardiovascular diseases and possible diagnostic and treatment approaches.  
Percutaneous Mechanical Aspiration vs Valve Surgery for Tricuspid-valve Endocarditis in Drug Users.  ;"BACKGROUND: Valve surgery in tricuspid-valve infective endocarditis is controversial in people who inject drugs (PWID) due to perceived risks of reinfection due to recidivism. The study objective was to compare outcomes of percutaneous mechanical aspiration (PMA) using the Penumbra Indigo system to valve surgery in PWID with tricuspid-valve infective endocarditis. METHODS: Retrospective cohort of adult PWID hospitalized with definite tricuspid-valve infective endocarditis and received PMA or valve surgery from 1/2014-4/2019. Primary endpoint was all-cause 12-month mortality; secondary endpoints included in-hospital mortality and all-cause 12-month readmission. RESULTS: 85 patients were included: 42 PMA, 43 valve surgery. Baseline patient demographics were similar between groups; 62 (73%) of patients were women, and the median (IQR) age was 31 (27-41) years. Seventy-four (86%) patients had a previous history of infective endocarditis and received long-term antibiotic therapy prior to surgical intervention; 33 (38%) patients presented with septic shock on admission. The most commonly organism was methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (32/84, 38%). Five (12%) PMA patients died in-hospital compared to 1 (2%) who received valve surgery (P=0.11). All-cause 12-month mortality was 24% and 19% for PMA and surgery groups, respectively (P=0.57). When considering confounders, there was no difference in all-cause 12-month mortality between PMA and valve surgery groups (adjOR, 1.5; 95%CI, 0.48-4.8); no significant differences in secondary outcomes were identified. CONCLUSIONS: PMA was associated with similar outcomes to valve surgery for management of TVE in PWID. PMA may be an alternative to valve surgery as a treatment or bridging strategy to surgery while PWID undergo addiction treatment.  "
Noninvasive assessment of fluid responsiveness for emergency abdominal surgery in dogs with pulmonary hypertension: Insights into high-risk companion animal anesthesia.  ;"OBJECTIVE: Optimizing cardiac stroke volume during high-risk surgical anesthesia is of particular interest with regard to a therapeutic target to reduce the incidence of postoperative complications. However, intensive fluid management in critically ill small animals with pulmonary hypertension (PH) has been empirically performed, and thus it can be challenging. Stroke volume variation (SVV) has been used as a dynamic preload predictor of fluid responsiveness. We hypothesized that if SVV exhibited robust reliability in the setting of hemodynamically unstable condition, it would provide more precise information on fluid resuscitation to translate it into veterinary anesthesia. Thus the aim of this study was to investigate the utility of SVV measured by the electrical velocimetry (EV) method for predicting fluid responsiveness in dogs with PH. METHODS: Sixteen dogs undergoing emergency abdominal surgery and diagnosed with PH secondary to myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) on preoperative transthoracic echocardiogram were included. Dogs were randomly assigned to 2 groups with and without inotropic cardiac support with dobutamine. Hemodynamic measurements including stroke volume and SVV derived from the EV device were performed under general anesthesia before (baseline) and after surgery (fluid challenge with a colloid solution defined by a SV increase of ≥ 10%). RESULTS: In both groups, SVV elevated significantly after abdominal surgery compared with baseline. In dobutamine infused group, the SVV values decreased significantly after fluid challenge (P < 0.05) with a greater number of responders than saline infused control group (P < 0.01). Receiver operating curve analysis of SVV confirmed high positive predictive value for dogs during dobutamine infusion (P < 0.05; cut-off value of 15%; specificity 90%, sensitivity 82%). CONCLUSIONS: Noninvasive EV monitoring may be useful for the prediction of fluid responsiveness in critically ill dogs with left-sided heart failure-related PH. This normalization of dynamic preload indices, which could be achieved more precisely under inotropic support, may prevent further detrimental consequence of fluid loading.  "
Interventional echocardiography: Opportunities and challenges in an emerging field.  ;The growth of transcatheter structural heart disease interventions has created a subspecialty of interventional imagers who focus on preprocedural planning and the periprocedural guidance of these complex cases. In particular interventional imagers who focus on periprocedural guidance have developed a specific expertise in interventional transesophageal echocardiography (iTEE). This nascent field has challenges in training, reimbursement, and occupational hazards which are unique to this field. This review encompasses the evolution of iTEE, current challenges, and future opportunities.  
[Aortic valve papillary fibroelastoma and anomalous origin of the right coronary artery].  ;"We report a case of a 48-year-old man who complained episodes of angina at rest. Instrumental investigation demonstrated a mass involving the ventricular side of the aortic valve suggestive for papillary fibroelastoma; an anomalous origin of the right coronary artery from the left sinus of Valsalva and no significant coronary artery disease were shown as well. The patient underwent open heart surgery, the tumor was excised and the aortic valve was spared. Pathological examination confirmed the diagnostic hypothesis of papillary fibroelastoma. The resolution of anginal symptoms after surgery suggests the possibility of papillary fibroelastoma causing these symptoms.  "
Annuloplasty for mitral valve repair in degenerative disease: to be flexible or to be rigid? That's still the question.  ;The choice of ring for mitral valve repair is still largely left to the surgeon's preferences and there are no specific guidelines regulating this decision. Despite this previous researches have described important features appertaining to each of the different types of rings currently available. Particularly, the debate is still open in regards to the flexibility that these devices should or should not have. Later in this issue of the Journal, Panicker and colleagues have reported their results with flexible and rigid rings in mitral valve repair. The results are very interesting and once again are highlighting the importance of using the right ring for the right disease.  
Predictive Value of Pre-Operative 2D and 3D Transthoracic Echocardiography in Patients Undergoing Mitral Valve Repair: Long Term Follow Up of Mitral Valve Regurgitation Recurrence and Heart Chamber Remodeling.  ;"The ""ideal"" management of asymptomatic severe mitral regurgitation (MR) in valve prolapse (MVP) is still debated. The aims of this study were to identify pre-operatory parameters predictive of residual MR and of early and long-term favorable remodeling after MVP repair. We included 295 patients who underwent MV repair for MVP with pre-operatory two- and three-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography (2DTTE and 3DTTE) and 6-months (6M) and 3-years (3Y) follow-up 2DTTE. MVP was classified by 3DTTE as simple or complex and surgical procedures as simple or complex. Pre-operative echo parameters were compared to post-operative values at 6M and 3Y. Patients were divided into Group 1 (6M-MR < 2) and Group 2 (6M-MR ≥ 2), and predictors of MR 2 were investigated. MVP was simple in 178/295 pts, and 94% underwent simple procedures, while in only 42/117 (36%) of complex MVP a simple procedure was performed. A significant relation among prolapse anatomy, surgical procedures and residual MR was found. Post-operative MR ≥ 2 was present in 9.8%: complex MVP undergoing complex procedures had twice the percentage of MR ≥ 2 vs. simple MVP and simple procedures. MVP complexity resulted independent predictor of 6M-MR ≥ 2. Favorable cardiac remodeling, initially found in all cases, was maintained only in MR < 2 at 3Y. Pre-operative 3DTTE MVP morphology identifies pts undergoing simple or complex procedures predicting MR recurrence and favorable cardiac remodeling.  "
An endoscopic repair of residual post-myocardial infarction ventricular septal defect.  ;"Post-myocardial infarction (MI) ventricular septal defect (VSD) is a serious condition that is, fortunately, less diagnosed nowadays due to the advances in early diagnosis and treatment of ischaemic heart disease (incidence 1-2%). Despite the lower mortality of both surgical and interventional closure of the defect (25%) as compared to medical therapy (40-50%), there are still risks of residual leak in both approaches. Herein, we describe a case of a successful endoscopic-assisted repair of a delayed residual leak post-MI VSD after surgical repair. An attempt for interventional closure of the leaking point had failed; an endoscopic-assisted minimal access closure was successfully performed.  "
National trends and 30-day readmission rates for next-day-discharge TAVR: An analysis from the Nationwide readmissions database, 2012-2016.  ;"BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has evolved toward a minimalist approach, resulting in shorter hospital stays. Real-world trends of next-day discharge (NDD) TAVR are unknown. This study aimed to evaluate underlying trends and readmissions of NDD-TAVR. METHODS: This study was derived from the Nationwide Readmissions Database (NRD) from 2012 to 2016. International Classification of Diseases, Ninth and Tenth revisions, codes were used to identify patients. Any discharge within 1day of admission was identified as NDD. NDD-TAVR trends over the years were analyzed, and any admissions within 30days were considered readmissions. A hierarchical logistic regression model was used to identify predictors of readmission. RESULTS: Of 49,742 TAVR procedures, 3104 were NDD. The percentage of NDD-TAVR increased from 1.5% (46/3051) in 2012 to 12.2% (2393/19,613) in 2016. However, the 30-day readmission rate remained the same over the years (8.6%). The patients' mean age was 80.3±8.4years. Major readmission causes were heart-failure exacerbation (16%), infections (9%), and procedural complications (8%). In 2016, there were significantly higher late conduction disorder and gastrointestinal bleeding readmission rates than in 2012-2015. Significant predictors of readmission were anemia, baseline conduction disease, cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, neoplastic disorders, and discharge to facility. CONCLUSIONS: The percentage of NDD-TAVR increased over the years; however, readmission rates remained the same, with a higher rate of conduction abnormality-related hospitalizations in 2016. Careful discharge planning that includes identification of baseline factors that predict readmission and knowledge of etiologies may further prevent 30-day readmissions.  "
A Preclinical Trial of Perventricular Pulmonary Valve Implantation: Pericardial Versus Aortic Porcine Valves Mounted on Self-Expandable Stent.  ;"BACKGROUND: Perventricular pulmonary valve implantation (PPVI) of a xenograft valve can be a less invasive technique that avoids cardiopulmonary bypass in patients who require pulmonary valve replacement. We compared the hemodynamics, durability, and histologic changes between two different xenogenic valves (pericardial versus aortic valve porcine xenografts) implanted into the pulmonary valve position using a PPVI technique, and evaluated the safety and efficacy of PPVI as a preclinical study. METHODS: In 18 sheep, pericardial (group PP, n = 9) or aortic valve (group PAV, n = 9) xenogenic porcine valves manufactured as a stented valve were implanted using a PPVI technique. The porcine tissues were decellularized, alpha-galactosidase treated, fixed with glutaraldehyde after space-filler treatment, and detoxified to improve durability. Hemodynamic and immunohistochemical studies were performed after the implantation; radiologic and histologic studies were performed after a terminal procedure. RESULTS: All stented valves were positioned properly after the implantation, and echocardiography and cardiac catheterization demonstrated good hemodynamic state and function of the valves. All the anti-α-Gal IgM and IgG titers were below 0.3 optical density. Computed tomography of extracted valves demonstrated no significant differences in degree of calcification between the two groups (p=0.927). Microscopic findings revealed a minimal amount of calcification and no significant infiltration of macrophage or T-cell in both groups, regardless of the implantation duration. CONCLUSIONS: The PPVI is a feasible technique. Both stented valves made of PP and PAV showed no significant differences in hemodynamic profile, midterm durability, and degree of degenerative dystrophic calcification.  "
Fetal Pulmonary Valvuloplasty in Fetuses with Right Ventricular Outflow Tract Obstructive Disease: Experience and Outcome of the First Five Cases in China.  ;The current study was to report our initial experiences of fetal pulmonary valvuloplasty (FPV) for fetuses with pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum (PA/IVS) and critical pulmonary stenosis (CPS), including case selection, technical feasibility, and the effects of FPV on utero and postnatal outcome. Two fetuses with PA/IVS and three fetuses with CPS were enrolled between September 2016 and April 2018. All fetuses were with concomitant severe right ventricular dysplasia and growth arrest. Parameters of right cardiac development and hemodynamics, including tricuspid/mitral annulus ratio (TV/MV), right ventricle/left ventricle long-axis ratio (RV/LV), tricuspid valve inflow duration/cardiac cycle ratio (TVI/CC), degree of tricuspid regurgitation (TR), and blood flow direction of arterial duct and ductus venosus, were evaluated using echocardiogram. FPV was performed trans-abdominally under ultrasound guidance. Echocardiogram was performed post-FPV and every 2-4 weeks thereafter until delivery. The median gestational age at the time of FPV was 28 weeks. From technical perspective, pulmonary balloon valvuloplasty was successfully performed and the opening of pulmonary valve was improved in all fetuses in 2-4 weeks. However, progressive restenosis was observed in four fetuses with gestation advancing, and re-atresia occurred in two PA/IVS fetuses at 36th and 37th weeks' gestation, respectively. The growth trajectories of TV/MV, RV/LV, and TVI/CC were improved in the 1st week after FPV and then slowed down along with pulmonary valve restenosis. All fetuses were born alive and underwent postnatal interventions, including pulmonary balloon valvuloplasty in three fetuses and surgical procedures in two fetuses. During follow-up, three fetuses turned to be biventricular, one became one and a half ventricular at 1-year old, and one died of neonatal infection. Although pulmonary valve restenosis might occur as gestation advancing, FPV seems to be a safe and feasible procedure to improve the growth trajectories of right heart for fetuses with PA/IVS and CPS.  
Bicuspid aortopathy - molecular involvement of microRNAs and MMP-TIMP.  ;OBJECTIVES: We aimed to elucidate the correlation between expression patterns of aortic tissue microRNAs and the aortopathy formation in bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) disease. METHODS: All 65 patients who underwent elective aortic valve repair/replacement +/- proximal aortic replacement due to BAV disease with or without concomitant aortic aneurysm were identified from our BAV registry. Aortic tissue was collected intraoperatively from the ascending aorta at the greater and lesser curvature. Aortic tissue microRNAs analysis included 11 microRNAs (miR-1, miR-17, miR-18a, miR-19a, miR-20a, miR-21, miR-29b, miR-106a, miR-133a, miR-143 and miR-145). Furthermore, analysis of MMP2, TIMP1/2 mRNA and the protein expression was subsequently performed. Primary study endpoint was the correlation between microRNAs and MMP2, TIMP1/2 mRNA/protein expression. RESULTS: We found a significant association between miR-133a and TIMP1 mRNA (r = 0.870, p < 0.001), an inverse correlation between miR-143a and MMP2 protein expression (r=-0.614, p = 0.044) and a positive correlation between miR-133a and TIMP-2 protein expression (r = 0.583, p = 0.036) at the greater curvature. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that aortic tissue microRNAs may reflect remodeling processes of the proximal aorta in BAV aortopathy. Specific aortic tissue microRNAs may exert their regulatory effects on the aortopathy through their impact on MMPs/TIMPs homeostasis at the level of greater curvature.  
Effects of COPD on in-hospital outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve implantation: Results from the National Inpatient Sample database.  ;"BACKGROUND: Comorbid chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) increases morbidity and mortality among aortic valve replacement patients undergoing conventional surgery. The impact of COPD in patients undergoing less invasive transcatheter aortic valve insertion (TAVI) is unclear. HYPOTHESIS: This study evaluates the in-hospital outcomes of TAVI in patients with and without COPD. METHODS: This population-based, retrospective study of 8466 TAVI patients (29.87% with COPD) evaluates the effects of COPD on short-term clinical outcomes (in-hospital mortality, length of hospital stay, and postoperative complications) using data from the National Inpatient Sample database from 2011 to 2014. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine factors associated with in-hospital mortality and postoperative complications. Linear regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with length of hospital stay. RESULTS: COPD is significantly associated with increased risk of respiratory complications and pneumonia after TAVI (aOR = 1.43, 95% CI: 1.24-1.64; P < .001) but not in-hospital mortality, length of hospital stay, or non-respiratory postoperative complications as compared to non-COPD patients. Concomitant COPD is significantly associated with increased risk of respiratory complications or pneumonia after TAVI but may still be the best treatment option for some patients. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with comorbid COPD who receive TAVI have greater risk of developing postoperative respiratory complications and pneumonia. Vigilance for specific respiratory complications is highly warranted when treating this subgroup. Treatment decisions must be individualized.  "
A modified frozen elephant trunk technique for acute Stanford type A aortic dissection.  ;"BACKGROUND: Acute Stanford type A aortic dissection is often fatal, with a high mortality rate and requiring emergency intervention. Salvage surgery aims to keep the patient alive by addressing severe aortic regurgitation, tamponade, primary tear, and organ malperfusion and, if possible, prevent the late dissection-related complications in the proximal and downstream aorta. Unfortunately, no optimal standard treatment or technique to treat this disease exists. Total arch replacement with frozen elephant trunk technique plays an important role in treating acute type A aortic dissection. We aim to describe a modified elephant trunk technique and report its short-term outcomes. METHODS: From February 2018 to August 2019, 16 patients diagnosed with acute Stanford type A aortic dissection underwent surgery with the modified frozen elephant trunk technique at Xiamen Heart Center (male/female: 9/7; average age: 56.1 ± 7.6 years). All perioperative variables were recorded and analyzed. We measured the diameters of the ascending aorta, aortic arch, and descending aorta on the bifurcation of the pulmonary and abdominal aortas and compared the diameters at admission, before discharge, and 3 months after discharge. RESULTS: Fifteen patients (93.8%) had hypertension. The primary tears were located in the lesser curvature of the aortic arch and ascending aorta in 5 (31.3%) and 9 patients (56.3%), respectively, and no entry was found in 2 patients (12.5%). The dissection extended to the iliac artery and distal descending aorta in 14 (87.6%) and 2 patients (12.5%), respectively. The duration of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), cross-clamping, and antegrade cerebral perfusion were 215.8 ± 40.5, 140.8 ± 32.3, and 55.1 ± 15.2 min, respectively. Aortic valve repair was performed in 15 patients (93.8%). Bentall procedure was performed in one patient (6.3%). Another patient received coronary artery repair (6.3%). The diameters at all levels were greater on discharge than those on admission, except the aortic arch. After 3 months, the true lumen diameter distal to the frozen elephant trunk increased, indicating false lumen thrombosis and/or aortic remodeling. CONCLUSIONS: The modified frozen elephant trunk technique for acute Stanford type A aortic dissection is safe and feasible and could be used for organ malperfusion. Short-term outcomes are encouraging, but long-term outcomes require further investigation.  "
Prosthesis-patient mismatch after mitral valve replacement: A pooled meta-analysis of Kaplan-Meier-derived individual patient data.  ;"OBJECTIVE: The hemodynamic effect and early and late survival impact of prosthesis-patient mismatch (PPM) after mitral valve replacement remains insufficiently explored. METHODS: Pubmed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for English language original publications. The search yielded 791 potentially relevant studies. The final review and analysis included 19 studies compromising 11,675 patients. RESULTS: Prosthetic effective orifice area was calculated with the continuity equation method in 7 (37%), pressure half-time method in 2 (10%), and partially or fully obtained from referenced values in 10 (53%) studies. Risk factors for PPM included gender (male), diabetes mellitus, chronic renal disease, and the use of bioprostheses. When pooling unadjusted data, PPM was associated with higher perioperative (odds ratio [OR]: 1.66; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.32-2.10; p < .001) and late mortality (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.46; 95% CI: 1.21-1.77; p < .001). Moreover, PPM was associated with higher late mortality when Cox proportional-hazards regression (HR: 1.97; 95% CI: 1.57-2.47; p < .001) and propensity score (HR: 1.99; 95% CI: 1.34-2.95; p < .001) adjusted data were pooled. Contrarily, moderate (HR: 1.01; 95% CI: 0.84-1.22; p = .88) or severe (HR: 1.19; 95% CI: 0.89-1.58; p = .24) PPM were not related to higher late mortality when adjusted data were pooled individually. PPM was associated with higher systolic pulmonary pressures (mean difference: 7.88 mmHg; 95% CI: 4.72-11.05; p < .001) and less pulmonary hypertension regression (OR: 5.78; 95% CI: 3.33-10.05; p < .001) late after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Mitral valve PPM is associated with higher postoperative pulmonary artery pressure and might impair perioperative and overall survival. The relation should be further assessed in properly designed studies.  "
A hybrid endocardial-epicardial biventricular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator to circumvent the tricuspid valve.  ;The development of pacing and defibrillator systems that do not involve hardware traversing the tricuspid annulus can be desirable in order to minimize lead-related complications such as tricuspid regurgitation. Occasionally, primary tricuspid valve pathology (ie, infectious endocarditis, nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis, and carcinoid disease) or congenital heart disease prohibits use of transvenous leads and alternative strategies are required to provide pacing or defibrillation. We describe such a case in which a biventricular implantable cardioverter defibrillator was implanted using a hybrid system involving endocardial and epicardial components.  
3D Echocardiography Provides Highly Accurate 3D Printed Models in Congenital Heart Disease.  ;Cardiac 3D printing is mainly performed from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) 3D datasets, though anatomic detail of atrioventricular (AV) valves may be limited. 3D echo provides excellent visualization of AV valves. Thus, we tested the feasibility and accuracy of 3D printing from 3D echo in this pilot series of subjects with congenital heart disease (CHD), with a focus on valve anatomy. Five subjects with CHD were identified. 3D echo data were converted to 3D printable files and printed in collaboration with 3D Systems Healthcare (Golden, Colorado). A novel technique for valve modeling was utilized using commercially available software. Two readers (KM, SA) independently measured valve structures from 3D models and compared to source echo images. 3D printing was feasible for all cases. Table 1 shows measurements comparing 2D echo to 3D models. Bland Altman analysis showed close agreement and no significant bias between 2D and digital 3D models (mean difference 0.0, 95% CI 1.1 to - 1.1) or 2D vs printed 3D models, though with wider limits of agreement (mean difference - 0.3, 95% CI 1.9 to - 2.6). Accuracy of 3D models compared to 2D was within < 0.5 mm. This pilot study shows 3D echo datasets can be used to reliably print AV and semilunar valve structures in CHD. The 3D models are highly accurate compared to the source echo images. This is a novel and value-added technique that adds incremental information on cardiac anatomy over current methods.  
Geleophysic and acromicric dysplasias: natural history, genotype-phenotype correlations, and management guidelines from 38 cases.  ;PURPOSE: Geleophysic dysplasia (GD) and acromicric dysplasia (AD) are characterized by short stature, short extremities, and progressive joint limitation. In GD, cardiorespiratory involvement can result in poor prognosis. Dominant variants in the FBN1 and LTBP3 genes are responsible for AD or GD, whereas recessive variants in the ADAMTSL2 gene are responsible for GD only. The aim of this study was to define the natural history of these disorders and to establish genotype-phenotype correlations. METHODS: This monocentric retrospective study was conducted between January 2008 and December 2018 in a pediatric tertiary care center and included patients with AD or GD with identified variants (FBN1, LTBP3, or ADAMTSL2). RESULTS: Twenty-two patients with GD (12 ADAMTSL2, 8 FBN1, 2 LTBP3) and 16 patients with AD (15 FBN1, 1 LTBP3) were included. Early death occurred in eight GD and one AD. Among GD patients, 68% presented with heart valve disease and 25% developed upper airway obstruction. No AD patient developed life-threatening cardiorespiratory issues. A greater proportion of patients with either a FBN1 cysteine variant or ADAMTSL2 variants had a poor outcome. CONCLUSION: GD and AD are progressive multisystemic disorders with life-threatening complications associated with specific genotype. A careful multidisciplinary follow-up is needed.  
Long Term Survival After Surgery for Ischaemic Mitral Regurgitation: A Single Centre Australian Experience.  ;BACKGROUND: Ischaemic mitral regurgitation (IMR) is associated with an increase in both mortality and congestive heart failure in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Intervention for moderate to severe IMR involves either valve repair or replacement. The ideal option is yet to be fully defined with relatively poor long-term survival being noted in the literature. METHOD: A retrospective observational study was conducted to review the outcomes of patients undergoing CABG in combination with either mitral valve repair (MVr) or mitral valve replacement (MVR) for concurrent coronary artery disease with moderate to severe IMR at The Prince Charles Hospital in Brisbane between the years 2002 to 2015. RESULTS: One hundred and five (105) patients were included, 81 patients (77%) undergoing CABG and MVr and 24 patients (23%) undergoing CABG and MVR. There was no difference in 30-day mortality between the two groups (1% in MVr and 0% in MVR, p=0.589), however patients in the MVr group were significantly more likely, in univariate and multivariate analysis, to develop at least moderate MR (40% v. 8%, p=0.006). The 5-year survival was 87% and 55% at 10 years. CONCLUSIONS: In patients undergoing CABG and mitral valve intervention for IMR, long-term mortality remains high. There was no difference in short- or long-term mortality between repair and replacement although recurrence of at least moderate mitral regurgitation was significantly higher with mitral valve repair.  
Blood flow simulations in the pulmonary bifurcation in relation to adult patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot.  ;Understanding the haemodynamic environment of the pulmonary bifurcation is important in adults with repaired conotruncal congenital heart disease. In these patients, dysfunction of the pulmonary valve and narrowing of the branch pulmonary arteries are common and can have serious clinical consequences. The aim of this study was to numerically investigate the underlying blood flow characteristics in the pulmonary trunk under a range of simplified conditions. For that, an in-depth analysis was conducted in idealised two-dimensional geometries that facilitate parametric investigation of healthy and abnormal conditions. Subtle variations in morphology influenced the haemodynamic environment and wall shear stress distribution. The pressure in the left pulmonary artery was generally higher than that in the right and main arteries, but was markedly reduced in the presence of a local stenosis. Different downstream pressure conditions altered the branch flow ratio, from 50:50% to more realistic 60:40% ratios in the right and left pulmonary artery, respectively. Despite some simplifications, this study highlights some previously undocumented aspects of the flow in bifurcating geometries, by clarifying the role of the stagnation point location on wall shear stress and differential branch pressures. In addition, measurements of the mean pressure ratios in the pulmonary bifurcation are discussed in the context of a new haemodynamic index which could potentially contribute to the assessment of left pulmonary artery stenosis in tetralogy of Fallot patients. Further studies are required to confirm the results in patient-specific models with personalised physiological flow conditions.  
A Genomic Study of Myxomatous Mitral Valve Disease in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels.  ;Cavalier King Charles spaniels (CKCSs) show the earliest onset and the highest incidence of myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD). Previous studies have suggested a polygenic inheritance of the disease in this breed and revealed an association with regions on canine chromosomes 13 and 14. Following clinical and echocardiographic examinations, 33 not-directly-related CKCSs were selected and classified as cases (n = 16) if MMVD was present before 5 years of age or as controls (n = 17) if no or very mild MMVD was present after 5 years of age. DNA was extracted from whole blood and genotyped with a Canine 230K SNP BeadChip instrument. Cases and controls were compared with three complementary genomic analyses (Wright's fixation index-FST, cross-population extended haplotype homozygosity-XP-EHH, and runs of homozygosity-ROH) to identify differences in terms of heterozygosity and regions of homozygosity. The top 1% single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected and mapped, and the genes were thoroughly investigated. Ten consensus genes were found localized on chromosomes 3-11-14-19, partially confirming previous studies. The HEPACAM2, CDK6, and FAH genes, related to the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) pathway and heart development, also emerged in the ROH analysis. In conclusion, this work expands the knowledge of the genetic basis of MMVD by identifying genes involved in the early onset of MMVD in CKCSs.  
[Percutaneous treatment of double valve defect with a modified extracorporeal membrane oxygenation system].  ;Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been developed to provide hemodynamic support in patients with severe cardiac or respiratory failure. In the last few years, its use has become increasingly common in interventional cardiology rooms for high-risk coronary interventions and for transcatheter therapies for valvular disease, which are increasingly complex in subsets of fragile patients at high surgical risk and with multiple comorbidities.Here, we describe the treatment of an extremely critical patient for severe dual valvulopathy, severe impairment of post-infarct systolic function, advanced heart failure with prohibitive operative risk. In a single session, the double valvular volume defect was treated percutaneously, using ECMO with an additional drainage of the left ventricle, performing a transcatheter implantation of two aortic valve prostheses with the valve-in-valve technique and the implantation of two MitraClips with excellent final result.  
Risk Factors for Mortality and Circulatory Outcome Among Neonates Prenatally Diagnosed With Ebstein Anomaly or Tricuspid Valve Dysplasia: A Multicenter Study.  ;"Background In a recent multicenter study of perinatal outcome in fetuses with Ebstein anomaly or tricuspid valve dysplasia, we found that one third of live-born patients died before hospital discharge. We sought to further describe postnatal management strategies and to define risk factors for neonatal mortality and circulatory outcome at discharge. Methods and Results This 23-center, retrospective study from 2005 to 2011 included 243 fetuses with Ebstein anomaly or tricuspid valve dysplasia. Among live-born patients, clinical and echocardiographic factors were evaluated for association with neonatal mortality and palliated versus biventricular circulation at discharge. Of 176 live-born patients, 7 received comfort care, 11 died <24 hours after birth, and 4 had insufficient data. Among 154 remaining patients, 38 (25%) did not survive to discharge. Nearly half (46%) underwent intervention. Mortality differed by procedure; no deaths occurred in patients who underwent right ventricular exclusion. At discharge, 56% of the cohort had a biventricular circulation (13% following intervention) and 19% were palliated. Lower tricuspid regurgitation jet velocity (odds ratio [OR], 2.3 [1.1-5.0], 95% CI, per m/s; P=0.025) and lack of antegrade flow across the pulmonary valve (OR, 4.5 [1.3-14.2]; P=0.015) were associated with neonatal mortality by multivariable logistic regression. These variables, along with smaller pulmonary valve dimension, were also associated with a palliated outcome. Conclusions Among neonates with Ebstein anomaly or tricuspid valve dysplasia diagnosed in utero, a variety of management strategies were used across centers, with poor outcomes overall. High-risk patients with low tricuspid regurgitation jet velocity and no antegrade pulmonary blood flow should be considered for right ventricular exclusion to optimize their chance of survival.  "
[Percutaneous closure of aortic anastomotic leak using amplatzer vascular plug Ⅳ: a case report].  ;Publisher: 该文报道1例Standford A型主动脉夹层术后发生吻合口漏的病例，细小的漏口位于人工血管远端与自体主动脉吻合区，形成升主动脉假性动脉瘤。术中使用4 F造影导管释放Ⅳ型血管塞，有效封堵漏口，同时使得假性动脉瘤血栓化，短期疗效理想。.  
[Long-term outcome of percutaneous balloon aortic valvuloplasty for children with congenital aortic valve stenosis].  ;Objective: To assess the efficacy and long-term outcome of percutaneous balloon aortic valvuloplasty (PBAV) for children with congenital aortic stenosis (CAS) and to explore risk factors for significant aortic regurgitation (AR) and reintervention after PBAV during follow up. Methods: This was a retrospective study. Children (≤18 years old) with CAS, who underwent PBAV in Guangdong Provincial Hospital from January 2004 to December 2018, were included in this study. Demographic, preoperative transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and surgical data were collected. Postoperative complications were closely observed, and the patients were followed up at 1, 6, 12 months after the operation, and then at one year interval thereafter. Endpoint events included significant AR and reintervention. Reintervention was defined as any intervention that needed to be performed on the valve for various reasons, including re-PBAV, surgical valvuloplasty and valve replacement. Significant AR was defined as AR grade≥3 by TTE criteria. The results of the last TTE examination before the end of the study were collected. The Kaplan-Meier curve for long-term AR-free and intervention-free survival was plotted. Cox regression model was used to further analyze the risk factors for significant AR and reintervention after PBAV in CAS patients. Results: A total of 55 patients were enrolled in this study, and the age was 4.6(1.6, 6.5) years, with 37(67.3%) males. The peak systolic valve gradient fell from (80.3±30.6)mmHg to (38.5±18.5)mmHg(P<0.001, 1 mmHg=0.133 kPa). Surgical success rate was 89% (49/55). Acute post-PBAV AR occurred in 18 patients, including 3 patients with RA≥3 grade. In-hospital complications occurred in 6 patients (2 deaths, 2 cases of transient arrhythmia, and 2 cases of femoral artery embolization). Fifty patients accomplished the follow-up and the follow-up time was 6.2(3.4, 8.5) years. Significant AR was found in 20 patients. Significant AR-free survival rate was 53% at 5 years and 19% at 10 years. Reintervention was performed in 11 patients (4 with valvuloplasty and 7 with valve replacement), and the 5-year and 10-year intervention-free survival rates were 87% and 62%, respectively. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that acute post-PBAV AR was a risk factor for long-term significant AR (HR=2.398, 95%CI 1.007-5.712, P=0.048). Post-PBAV residual pressure gradient ≥ 35 mmHg (HR=4.747, 95%CI 1.116-19.329, P=0.030)and acute post-PBAV AR (HR=5.104, 95%CI 1.083-24.065, P=0.039)were risk factors for re-intervention. Conclusions: PBAV is safe and effective in the treatment of CAS in children, but attention should be paid on significant AR post procedure. Acute post-PBAV AR is a risk factor for re-intervention and significant AR post PBAV, and high post-PBAV residual pressure gradient is a risk factor for re-intervention.  
Clinical Impact of Intervention Strategies after failed Transcatheter Mitral Valve Repair.  ;"AIMS: Failure of Transcatheter Mitral Valve Repair (fTMVR) therapy has a decisive prognostic influence, and complex retreatment is of higher risk. The aim of this analysis is to evaluate the survival outcome of percutaneous procedures and surgery after unsuccessful TMVR interventions for different etiologies. METHODS AND RESULTS: Of 824 consecutive patients that had been treated with the MitraClip device at our institution, between September 2009 and May 2019, 63 (7.6%) symptomatic patients with therapy failure and persistent or recurrent mitral regurgitation (MR) underwent reinterventions. An outcome analysis for primary (PMR) and secondary mitral regurgitation (SMR) and subsequent percutaneous vs. surgical treatment was carried out. MitraClip reinterventions were performed in 36 patients (57.1%; n=26 SMR, n=10 PMR), while 27 (42.9%; n=13 SMR, n=14 PMR) underwent open-heart surgery. Surgical patients wiith PMR showed lower mortality than patients with SMR (p &lt; 0.0001) and reclip patients with PMR (p = 0.073). Atrial fibrillation (HR &amp; 95 CI: 2.915 [1.311, 6.480]), prior open-heart surgery (2.820 [1.215, 6.544] and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2.506 [1.099, 5.714]) increased the risk of death. T he level of post-interventional mitral regurgitation had no relevant impact on survival. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that after SMR and failed TMVR, reclipping is an appropriate treatment option for symptomatic patients. For PMR patients, surgery must be favored over a ReClip procedure. However, patients with atrial fibrillation, prior open-heart surgery and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are at risk of reduced survival after reinterventions.  "
miRNA-1183-targeted regulation of Bcl-2 contributes to the pathogenesis of rheumatic heart disease.  ;To determine whether up-regulation of miR-1183 targeting the gene for anti-apoptotic factor, B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) contributes to apoptosis in patients with rheumatic heart disease (RHD). Peripheral blood samples were isolated for miR-1183 characterization. The function of miRNA-1183 in RHD using miRNA mimic on PBMCs and THP-1 cell models. The binding of miR-1183 and Bcl-2 gene was confirmed by luciferase activity test. We also measured expression levels of BCL-2 in heart valve tissue from patients with RHD using ELISA and immunohistochemistry. In silico analysis and reporter gene assays indicated that miR-1183 directly targets the mRNA encoding BCL-2. It is found that miR-1183 binds directly to the 3'UTR of the BCL-2 mRNA and down-regulates the mRNA and protein levels of BCL-2. Overexpression of miR-1183 in RHD patients and cell lines down-regulated BCL-2 expression and induced apoptosis. With the progression of the disease, the expression of BCL-2 in the heart valve tissue of patients with RHD decreased. MiRNA-1183 is up-regulated in RHD and induces cardiac myocyte apoptosis through direct targeting and suppression of BCL-2, both of which might play important roles in RHD pathogenesis. During the compensatory period of RHD, up-regulated miR-1183 destroyed the balance of apoptosis proteins (Bax and BAK) in Bcl-2 family, enhance the apoptosis cascade reaction and reduce the anti apoptosis effect. The significantly higher expression levels of miR-1183 appear to play distinct roles in RHD pathogenesis by regulation BCL-2, possibly affecting myocardial apoptosis and remodeling in the context of RHD.

Candida spp. Infective Endocarditis: Characteristics and Outcomes of Twenty Patients with a Focus on Injection Drug use as a Predisposing Risk Factor.  ;"BACKGROUND: Candida spp. infective endocarditis (CIE) although rare is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Risk factors include prosthetic heart valves and injection drug use (IDU). We reviewed all cases of CIE at our institution to describe the microbiology, treatment, and outcomes of patients focusing on IDU as a predisposing factor. METHODS: Retrospective cohort of patients with definite CIE between 2013-2019 at a university hospital was analyzed. Demographic data collected included IDU, microbiologic, treatment, and mortality. The primary outcome of interest was 12-month, all-cause mortality. RESULTS: 20 patients were included (one had two separate episodes of CIE); CIE accounted for 4% of total infective endocarditis (IE) cases during the study period. The median (IQR) age was 38 (30-58) years, 10 (50%) had a previous history of IE, and 4 (20%) patients had prosthetic heart valves or an implanted cardiac device. Thirteen (65%) patients were IDU. The tricuspid valve was the primary valve involved (8/18, 44%), and C. albicans was the most frequently isolated organism (8, 36%). Echinocandin was the most common treatment strategy (8, 40%). Only three (15%) patients underwent valve replacement during hospitalization. There were no in-hospital fatalities, and 5 (25%) patients died at one-year; all were IDU (39% to 0%, P=0.11). CONCLUSION: CIE is a rare infectious disease seen more commonly in the IDU population. Cardiac surgery was rarely performed, and long-term mortality was 25%. Additional data are needed to identify ideal management strategies in this population.  "
Echocardiographic screening of pregnant women by non-physicians with remote interpretation in primary care.  ;BACKGROUND: Impact of heart disease (HD) on pregnancy is significant. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the feasibility of integrating screening echocardiography (echo) into the Brazilian prenatal primary care to assess HD prevalence. METHODS: Over 13 months, 20 healthcare workers acquired simplified echo protocols, utilizing hand-held machines (GE-VSCAN), in 22 primary care centres. Consecutive pregnant women unaware of HD underwent focused echo, remotely interpreted in USA and Brazil. Major HD was defined as structural valve abnormalities, more than mild valve dysfunction, ventricular systolic dysfunction/hypertrophy, or other major abnormalities. Screen-positive women were referred for standard echo. RESULTS: At total, 1 112 women underwent screening. Mean age was 27 ± 8 years, mean gestational age 22 ± 9 weeks. Major HD was found in 100 (9.0%) patients. More than mild mitral regurgitation was observed in 47 (4.2%), tricuspid regurgitation in 11 (1.0%), mild left ventricular dysfunction in 4 (0.4%), left ventricular hypertrophy in 2 (0.2%) and suspected rheumatic heart disease in 36 (3.2%): all, with mitral valve and two with aortic valve (AV) involvement. Other AV disease was observed in 11 (10%). In 56 screen-positive women undergoing standard echo, major HD was confirmed in 45 (80.4%): RHD findings in 12 patients (all with mitral valve and two with AV disease), mitral regurgitation in 40 (14 with morphological changes, 10 suggestive of rheumatic heart disease), other AV disease in two (mild/moderate regurgitation). CONCLUSIONS: Integration of echo screening into primary prenatal care is feasible in Brazil. However, the low prevalence of severe disease urges further investigations about the effectiveness of the strategy.  
Coronary Revascularization of Giant Aneurysms in Children With Kawasaki Disease: A Report of Two Cases.  ;In recent years, >100 cases of coronary artery stenotic lesions due to Kawasaki disease were treated with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Surgical indications include stenosis of >75%, myocardial infarction history, electrocardiographic changes, and ischemia, as detected by myocardial scintigraphy and electrocardiography, due to drugs or exercise. Some centers have reported good patency rates, even in infants. The advantages of CABG in younger patients are minimal loss of left ventricular function, early elimination of post-operative ischemia risk, and improved quality of life. However, the disadvantage of performing CABG in younger patients is the small coronary artery diameter and the thin vessel wall, which can lead to post-operative occlusion, especially when performed by inexperienced surgeons. The optimal timing of CABG varies by institution and case, which depends on the presence or absence of complications, such as left ventricular dysfunction or valve regurgitation, and surgeon's experience. Importantly, unlike adult surgery, childhood CABG needs to be kept open for the very longest possible period of time to determine the optimal conditions for surgery. We report two pediatric cases of giant coronary artery aneurysms diagnosed in infancy. During school age, the patients had a mild decline of left ventricular ejection function. In one case, there were no clinical symptoms because of the development of collateral vessels and limitation of exercise. Both patients underwent surgery with good results. The gastric gastroepiploic artery could be anastomosed owing to the development of collateral blood vessels, although it was obstructed. At 1 year after surgery, both patients had a good post-operative course without complications of anastomotic stenosis or myocardial damage due to aneurysm resection. If conditions are favorable, bypass surgery can be postponed to several years until the coronary arteries are sufficiently large to warrant a delay in coronary artery stenosis in cases of infantile Kawasaki disease.  
A combined approach to correct posterior left ventricular aneurysm, aortic stenosis and coronary artery disease.  ;Ischaemic heart disease and aortic stenosis are potentially life-threatening conditions. A post-infarct left ventricular aneurysm, when combined with the above, is particularly hazardous. We present a case where all three conditions occurred simultaneously and describe the surgical approach undertaken to attempt correction. The patient underwent aneurysmectomy together with aortic valve replacement and two-vessel coronary artery bypass grafting. The aneurysm was excised with direct linear closure of the walls using a Teflon-buttressed interrupted mattress suture technique. Post-operatively, ventricular systolic function was good (LVEF 40%) together with a well-seated aortic valve showing no paravalvular leaks. This case highlights the importance of meticulous removal of thrombus from the aneurysm and everting the edges thereby eliminating a thrombogenic surface and the risk of embolic stroke. The restorative procedure itself serves to underline the importance of ventricular shape in the effective functioning of the myocardium for sustaining an adequate stroke volume with normalized physiology.  
Impact of Hypothyroidism on Echocardiographic Characteristics of Patients With Heart Valve Disease: A Single-Center Propensity Score-Based Study.  ;Background: Hypothyroidism is known to be correlated with multiple heart diseases. However, the influence of hypothyroidism on the patients with heart valve disease (HVD) is still unclear. The purpose of our study was to investigate the impact of hypothyroidism on echocardiographic characteristics of patients with heart valve disease. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study which included 2,128 patients with HVD, and they were divided into euthyroid, subclinical hypothyroidism (SCHypoT), and overt hypothyroidism (OHypoT) group. Echocardiographic characteristics before and after valve surgery between groups were compared by using propensity score (PS) analysis. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to compare the percent of recovery of left atrial (LA) enlargement between groups. Results: Overall, 463 patients had hypothyroidism (404 SCHypoT patients and 59 OHypoT patients), and 1,665 patients were euthyroid. At baseline, hypothyroidism was associated with significantly higher left atrial diameter (LAD), interventricular septum thickness, left ventricular posterior wall thickness, pulmonary artery systolic pressure, and lower left ventricular ejection fraction. After valve surgery, only LAD remained significantly higher in the patients with hypothyroidism. Additionally, patients with hypothyroidism had a significantly lower recovery rate of LA enlargement after valve surgery compared with euthyroid patients. Conclusion: Hypothyroidism was associated with a larger LAD in patients with HVD before and after surgery, which may suggest that hypothyroidism is a risk factor of LA enlargement of HVD. Besides, hypothyroidism was associated with a significantly lower recovery rate of LA enlargement after valve surgery.  
[Cardiac CT-Scan: Utility for the management of chest pain, cardiovascular screening and before atrial fibrillation ablation procedure].  ;Cardiac CT-scan is recommended for sorting patients presenting with stable or acute chest pain with low to intermediate risk of coronary artery disease (CAD). Recent studies have shown its reliability for diagnosing CAD in high-risk patients, notably those with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) without ST-elevation. Coronary CT-scan also represents a great opportunity for the screening of atherosclerosis in patients at risk and allows a better prevention of coronary artery disease by introduction of preventive treatments in patients with abnormal coronary CT-scan, especially statins. It is useful for the follow-up of patients who underwent a coronary arteries revascularization with either stents or bypasses. Coronary arteries calcium scoring appears to be an independent predictive factor of cardiovascular and total mortality and its use is recommended for stratifying the cardiovascular risk. However, its interpretation remains unobvious and the patient management is poorly improved by the results. Anyway, if the score is above zero, atherosclerosis is present and therefore a lipid lowering treatment should be discussed. Cardiac CT-scan has become the Gold Standard exam before an aortic valve replacement, for the measurement of the aortic root notably, allowing the best prothesis selection. Before atrial fibrillation ablation procedure by pulmonary vein isolation, the cardiac CT-scan allows a 3-D visualization of the two atria, especially the left atrium, and rules out any suspicion of cardiac thrombus. It allows the research of an anomalous pulmonary venous connection. The 3-D support will also enable the operator to navigate in the heart during the ablation procedure.  
Aorto-left ventricular tunnel: case series of a rare disease.  ;INTRODUCTION: Aorto-left ventricular tunnel is a rare disease that can cause significant morbidity early in life due to volume overload and left ventricular failure. Surgical intervention is usually curative with minimal early complications. However, long-term effects and outcome are not fully determined. OBJECTIVE: We are reporting a case series of this rare CHD with its long-term outcome. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of all children from birth to 14 years of age who were admitted between 2001 and 2020 with the diagnosis of aorto-left ventricular tunnel. Demographic, echocardiographic, and perioperative data were collected and reviewed. The pre-operative data were compared with data reviewed on the last outpatient follow-up. RESULTS: Total of five patients fulfilled our inclusion criteria. Three patients were diagnosed after auscultating an incidental murmur, one had symptoms of congestive heart failure, and one had an abnormal fetal echocardiogram. Echocardiography demonstrated stenotic and regurgitant aortic valve with severely depressed left ventricle function in two patients, one of them with also single left coronary artery. The other three patients had normal aortic valve structure and normal ventricular function. All five patients had surgical repair, two by patch closure at aortic end of aorto-left ventricular tunnel, two by patch closure at both aortic and left ventricular ends, and one by aortic root replacement using a homograft. During follow-up, there was no residual aorto-left ventricular tunnel in any of our five cases, two had moderate aortic regurgitation and one had moderate residual aortic stenosis. CONCLUSIONS: Spectrum of presentation for aorto-left ventricular tunnel varies from an occult lesion to frank left heart failure due to volume or less commonly, pressure overload. Early surgical repair is recommended and is usually associated with complete resolution. Long-term follow-up is recommended for aortic root dilatation and aortic valve competency, as valve function need to be addressed in a timely manner to avoid further complications.  
Perforated posterior mitral leaflet aneurysm in an 8-month-old infant.  ;Mitral valve aneurysm not associated with infective endocarditis is rarely reported in children. We report a case of perforated posterior mitral leaflet aneurysm in an infant with reference to surgical and histopathological findings. Although its aetiology remains unclear, we suggest to include mitral valve aneurysm in differential diagnosis as a cause of mitral regurgitation in children.  
Impact of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in patients undergoing cardiac surgery: a systematic review.  ;"The clinical status and prognosis of patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has dramatically changed in the recent years. Cardiovascular diseases can be related to combined antiretroviral therapy and to the aging of HIV-positive population, resulting in significant mortality and morbidity in those patients. It is crucial to understand whether the HIV-status affects the indications and outcomes of cardiac surgery. A literature search was conducted through electronic databases up to 15 May 2020 following PRISMA guidelines. Variables (i.e. patients characteristics) and endpoints (i.e. postoperative complications) were considered as defined in the original publications. All paper describing post-operative outcomes after cardiac surgery were included. Methodological quality of all included studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool and the US Preventive Services Task Force grade. A total of eight studies were included in this systematic review; five studies discussed the outcomes of patients with HIV infection, while three studies compared results based on HIV status. All evidences derived from retrospective observational studies with high variability and poor-to-fair quality. Most patients underwent surgical myocardial revascularization. HIV status is not associated with differences in operative mortality (P = 0.32), postoperative mediastinitis (P = 0.30) or pulmonary infective complications (P = 0.67). Cardiac surgery can be considered safe in HIV-positive patients, and HIV status alone should not be considered as a contraindication for cardiac surgery and should not be considered a risk factor for postoperative mortality or perioperative complications. Further studies are required for patients with AIDS.  "
Echocardiographic diagnosis of Shone's syndrome.  ;"Shone's syndrome is a rare congenital heart disease that includes 4 cardiovascular anomalies: supravalvular mitral ring, parachute mitral valve, subaortic stenosis, and coarctation of the aorta. Early diagnosis and treatment result in better outcomes. Echocardiography plays an important role in the diagnosis and is the optimal examination for detecting this disease. Pressure gradients are often unreliable and inaccurate; thus, careful anatomical observation of the left ventricular inflow and outflow tracts, particularly the mitral valve, is vital for accurate diagnosis and planning appropriate management. Herein, we describe 9 cases of Shone's syndrome, diagnosed with echocardiography and treated surgically.  "
Carcinoid Heart Disease: Pathophysiology, Pathology, Clinical Manifestations, and Management.  ;Carcinoid heart disease (CHD) is a rare and potentially lethal manifestation of an advanced carcinoid (neuroendocrine) tumor. The pathophysiology of CHD is related to vasoactive substances secreted by the tumor, of which serotonin is most prominent in the pathophysiology of CHD. Serotonin stimulates fibroblast growth and fibrogenesis, which can lead to cardiac valvular fibrosis. CHD primarily affects right heart valves, causing tricuspid and pulmonic regurgitation and less frequently stenosis of these valves. Left heart valves are usually spared because vasoactive substances such as serotonin are enzymatically inactivated in the lung vasculature. The pathology of CHD is characterized by plaque-like deposition of fibrous tissue on valvular cusps, leaflets, papillary muscles, chordae, and ventricular walls. Symptomatic CHD usually presents between 50 and 70 years of age, initially as dyspnea and fatigue. Echocardiography is the mainstay of imaging and demonstrates thickened right heart valves with limited mobility and regurgitation. Treatment focuses on control of the underlying carcinoid syndrome, targeting subsequent valvular heart disease and managing consequent heart failure. Surgical valve replacement and catheter-directed valve procedures may be effective for selected patients with CHD.  
Temporal changes in the incidence of infective endocarditis in Denmark 1997-2017: A nationwide study.  ;Background Infective endocarditis (IE) remains a life-threatening disease, yet substantial variation in reported incidences of the disease exist. We aimed to conduct a contemporary, nationwide study of the temporal changes in incidence of IE. Methods We included all Danish cases of first-time IE (1997-2017) using nationwide registries. Patients were grouped into three seven-year intervals (1997-2003, 2004-2010, 2011-2017). Crude annual incidence rates (IR) per 100,000 person-years (PY) were examined overall and per subgroups: age, sex, patients without prior prosthetic heart valve or a cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED). Results We identified 8675 patients with IE. Over time, patients were older at diagnosis with a median age of 66.2 years (interquartile range, IQR: 51.5-76.5) and 72.2 years (IQR 62.2-79.9) in 1997-2003 and 2011-2017, respectively. The overall IR increased from 5.0/100,000 PY (95% CI: 4.4-5.6) to 10.5/100,000 PY (95% CI: 9.6-11.3) from 1997 to 2017. IR for patients without prior prosthetic heart valve or a CIED increased from 4.9/100,000 PY (95% CI: 4.3-5.5) to 6.4/100,000 PY (95% CI: 5.8-7.1) (P ≤ 0.0001 for interaction). The IR in males increased from 5.6/100,000 PY (95% CI: 4.7-6.5) to 14.2/100,000 PY (95% CI: 12.9-15.6). The IR in females increased from 4.3/100,000 PY (95% CI: 3.6-5.2) to 6.7/100,000 PY (95% CI: 5.8-7.7), and the IR for patients ≥80 years increased eight-fold from 1997 to 2017. Conclusion The incidence of IE more than doubled during the study period. The increase was mainly seen among men and elderly patients only partly explained by the increase in patients with prior heart valve prosthesis or a CIED.  
CT-Determined Tricuspid Annular Dilatation Is Associated With Increased 2-Year Mortality in TAVR Patients.  ;"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence and prognostic impact of tricuspid annular dilatation (TAD) measured in multislice computed tomography datasets in patients undergoing transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve replacement for severe aortic stenosis. BACKGROUND: TAD is an increasingly recognized entity associated with poor outcomes in patients with valvular heart disease. METHODS: The maximal septolateral diameter of the tricuspid annulus was measured in consecutive patients with 3-dimensional multidetector row computed tomographic datasets undergoing transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve replacement. Receiver-operating curve characteristic analysis was performed to obtain an ideal, body surface area-normalized cutoff for TAD. Ethical approval was obtained from the institutional ethics board. RESULTS: The study included 1,137 patients, of whom 299 died within a mean follow-up period of 1.8 ± 1.0 years. TAD was identified in 446 patients (39.2%) on the basis of a receiver-operating characteristic cutoff of 23 mm/m2. TAD had no impact on procedural outcomes, including device failure defined according to Valve Academic Research Consortium-2 criteria. Patients with TAD experienced significantly greater mortality (hazard ratio: 1.99; 95% confidence interval: 1.59 to 2.51; p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis including clinical and echocardiographic parameters confirmed the predictive value of TAD (hazard ratio: 1.78; 95% confidence interval: 1.33 to 2.38; p < 0.001), while echocardiographic variables, including estimated pulmonary artery pressure and the severity of tricuspid regurgitation, did not reach statistical significance. The predictive value of TAD was incremental to a baseline model of clinical and echocardiographic parameters (continuous net reclassification improvement 0.204; p < 0.01) and incremental to the Society of Thoracic Surgeons score (continuous net reclassification improvement 0.209; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: TAD is an independent predictor of all-cause mortality in patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement.  "
Alterra Adaptive Prestent and SAPIEN 3 THV for Congenital Pulmonic Valve Dysfunction: An Early Feasibility Study.  ;"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to demonstrate the safety and functionality of the Alterra Adaptive Prestent and SAPIEN 3 transcatheter heart valve (THV) in patients with dysfunctional, dilated right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) greater or equal to moderate pulmonary regurgitation (PR). BACKGROUND: Significant variations in the size and morphology of the RVOT affect the placement of transcatheter pulmonary valves. The Alterra Prestent internally reduces and reconfigures the RVOT, providing a stable landing zone for the 29-mm SAPIEN 3 THV. METHODS: Eligible patients had moderate or greater PR, weighed >20 kg, and had RVOT diameter 27 to 38 mm and length >35 mm. The primary endpoint was device success, a 5-item composite: 1 Alterra Prestent deployed in the desired location, 1 SAPIEN 3 THV implanted in the desired location within the Prestent, right ventricular-to-pulmonary artery peak-to-peak gradient <35 mm Hg after THV implantation, less than moderate PR at discharge, and no explantation 24 h post-implantation. The secondary composite endpoint was freedom from THV dysfunction (RVOT/pulmonary valve (PV) reintervention, greater or equal to moderate total PR, mean RVOT/PV gradient ≥ 35 mm Hg at 30 days and 6 months. Descriptive statistics are reported. RESULTS: Enrolled patients (N = 15) had a median age and weight of 20 years and 61.7 kg, respectively; 93.3% were in New York Heart Association functional class I or II. Device success was 100%. No staged procedures were necessary. No THV dysfunction was reported to 6 months. No serious safety signals were reported. CONCLUSIONS: This early feasibility study demonstrated the safety and functionality of the Alterra Adaptive Prestent in patients with congenital RVOT dysfunction and moderate or greater PR. Durability and long-term outcome data are needed.  "
Procedural Characteristics and Late Outcomes of Percutaneous Coronary Intervention in the Workup Pre-TAVR.  ;"OBJECTIVES: This study sought to determine, in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) during the work-up pre-transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR): 1) the clinical and periprocedural PCI characteristics; 2) the long-term outcomes; and 3) the clinical events in those patients with complex coronary features. BACKGROUND: A PCI is performed in about 25% of TAVR candidates, but procedural features and late outcomes of pre-TAVR PCI remain largely unknown. METHODS: Multicenter study including 1197 consecutive patients who had PCI in the work-up pre-TAVR. A total of 1,705 lesions (1.5 ± 0.7 lesions per patient) were included. Death, stroke, myocardial infarction, and major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) were recorded, as well as target lesion failure (TLF) and target vessel failure (TVF). RESULTS: Half of patients exhibited a multivessel disease and the mean SYNTAX (SYNergy between PCI with TAXUS and Cardiac Surgery) score was 12.1 ± 9.1. The lesions were of B2/C type, calcified, bifurcation, and ostial in 49.9%, 45.8%, 21.4%, and 19.3% of cases, respectively. After a median follow-up of 2 (interquartile range: 1 to 3) years, a total of 444 (37.1%) patients presented an MACCE. Forty patients exhibited TVF (3.3%), with TLF identified in 32 (2.7%) patients. By multivariable analysis, previous peripheral artery disease (p < 0.001), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (p = 0.002), atrial fibrillation (p = 0.003), diabetes mellitus (p = 0.012), and incomplete revascularization (p = 0.014) determined an increased risk of MACCE. In patients with unprotected left main or SYNTAX score >32 (n = 128), TLF, TVF, and MACCE rates were 3.9%, 6.3%, and 35.9%, respectively (p = 0.378; p = 0.065, and p = 0.847, respectively, vs. the rest of the population). CONCLUSIONS: Patients undergoing PCI in the work-up pre-TAVR frequently exhibited complex coronary lesions and multivessel disease. PCI was successful in most cases, and TLF and TVF rates at 2-year follow-up were low, also among patients with high-risk coronary features. However, overall MACCE occurred in about one-third of patients, with incomplete revascularization determining an increased risk. These results should inform future studies to better determine the optimal revascularization strategy pre-TAVR.  "
Growth of hypoplastic mitral valves in hypoplastic left heart complex and similar constellations after anatomical left superior vena cava correction.  ;"OBJECTIVES: Left superior vena cava (LSVC)-related obstruction of mitral inflow is a rare finding in patients with complex cardiac anomalies like hypoplastic left heart complex. We report our experience by establishing a left superior to right superior caval vein continuity (innominate vein creation by direct LSVC-right superior vena cava end-to-side-anastomosis), and coronary sinus unroofing if indicated for LSVC-related mitral inflow obstruction. METHODS: Nineteen patients (median age: 1.0 ± 0.3 years; range: 7 days-4.8 years) underwent anatomical correction of LSVC without the use of foreign material in conjunction with repair or palliation of congenital anomalies in a single centre between April 2015 and November 2019. Indications for the procedure were LSVC-related obstruction of left ventricular inflow due to a dilated coronary sinus. Additional procedures included mitral (n = 7) or atrioventricular (n = 3) valve surgery, right ventricular to pulmonary artery conduit (n = 3), first stage palliation (n = 3) or biventricular repair (n = 5) of hypoplastic left heart complex. Three patients needed secondary mitral valve replacement (n = 3). RESULTS: All LSVC or coronary sinus-related obstructions were effectively relieved. No patient died early, 2 patients died late after the procedure. One patient needed stenting of the superior vena cava below the unobstructed cephalad vein anastomosis at the former right superior vena cava-cannulation-site. Follow-up was complete and demonstrated an 89.5% survival after 2.5 ± 0.4 years. Innominate vein patency was 100% documented by echocardiography (n = 19), cardiac catheterization (n = 6) or both. Mean mitral valve z-scores before the operation were -1.7 ± 0.2 (range -3.8 to 0.3) and increased to 0.7 ± 0.2 (range -0.7 to 1.9) after LSVC repair. CONCLUSIONS: Anatomical correction by surgical creation of an innominate vein is an effective method to relieve LSVC-related obstructions and promotes mitral valvar growth. Mitral ring sizes were at least normalized after surgery at the time of discharge. Further prospective follow-up studies to evaluate the growth potential of left-sided heart structures by reporting cardiac z-scores are needed to evaluate the true impact of coronary sinus unroofing.

Effects of perioperative oral care on postoperative inflammation following heart valve surgery.  ;OBJECTIVE: Whether oral health care during the perioperative period can lead to a better outcome after heart valve surgery has not been adequately elucidated. We examined the effects of perioperative oral care on postoperative inflammation response in patients who underwent heart valve surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, 223 patients scheduled for single valve heart surgery were divided into the oral care, who underwent professional teeth cleaning or scaling within 3 days prior to surgery, and also following surgery at least twice a week (n=111), and non-oral care (n=112) groups. After propensity score-matching, records of both groups (80:80) were examined after surgery to evaluate inflammation markers [white blood cell count (WBC), neutrophil/white blood cell ratio (NWR), C-reactive protein (CRP) level, body temperature (BT)]. RESULTS: WBC, NWR, CRP level, and BT were increased in both groups the day following surgery. Thereafter, CRP level, WBC, NWR, and BT on various days after surgery in the oral care group showed greater decreases as compared to the non-oral care group. CONCLUSIONS: Perioperative oral health care can decrease postoperative inflammation in patients undergoing heart valve surgery and may be important to ensure a better outcome in those patients.  
Role of multimodality imaging in evaluation of cardiovascular involvement in COVID-19.  ;"The management of patients infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may be difficult due to the need for dedicated in-hospital pathways, protective measures for healthcare professionals and isolated beds of intensive care, particularly in areas overwhelmed by wide viral spread. Although pneumonia is the most common clinical manifestation in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a variety of cardiovascular complications have been reported. An integrated diagnostic algorithm in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with suspected cardiac involvement (laboratory findings of myocardial injury and electrocardiographic changes) may help to avoid unnecessary examinations and minimize the risk of operator infection. Due to its mobility and bedside feasibility, echocardiography is the first-line imaging technique in this clinical setting. It quickly provides information on ventricular functions, pulmonary hypertension, valve disease and pericardial effusion. In case of ST-segment elevation (STE), urgent coronary angiography should be performed. Cardiac ultrasound helps distinguish between ischemic and non-ischemic myocardial disease and may detect pericardial disease. Transmural ischemic electrocardiographic changes, with or without early elevated troponin levels or echocardiographic wall motion abnormalities, will determine the need for early invasive coronary angiography. Computed tomography (CT) through its multiple applications (chest CT; CT pulmonary angiography and coronary CT angiography; late iodine enhancement CT) and cardiac magnetic resonance might be helpful in reinforcing or redirecting diagnostic hypothesis emerged by other clinical, electrocardiographic and echocardiographic findings. The current pandemic makes it challenging to perform serial invasive and non-invasive diagnostic testing in COVID-19 patients and high serum troponin level. Nevertheless, thoughtful and systematic use of an appropriate multimodality imaging strategy is clinically relevant to detect cardiac injury and distinguish myocardial infarction from, myocarditis, takotsubo syndrome and pulmonary embolism.

Asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis, bicuspid aortic valves and moderate aortic stenosis in heart failure: New indications for transcatheter aortic valve implantation.  ;Aortic stenosis (AS) remains one of the most common valvular heart diseases, with enormous impact on patient survival. Over the past years, transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has become a reality worldwide, offering a less invasive method to treat AS. Apart from the classical indications for aortic valve disease, recent studies tried to address unanswered questions for TAVI - asymptomatic severe AS, bicuspid aortic valves and moderate AS in patients with heart failure. This review discusses the rationale of those possible indications, pitfalls and current evidence in the medical literature.  
Dynamic handgrip exercise for the evaluation of mitral valve regurgitation: an echocardiographic study to identify exertion induced severe mitral regurgitation.  ;Handgrip exercise (HG) has been occasionally used as a stress test in echocardiography. The effect of HG on mitral regurgitation (MR) is not well known. This study aims to evaluate this effect and the possible role of HG in the echocardiographic evaluation of MR. 722 patients with MR were included (18% primary, 82% secondary disease). We calculated effective regurgitant orifice area (EROA) and regurgitant volume (RVOL) at rest and during dynamic HG. Increase in MR was defined as any increase in EROA or RVOL. We analyzed the data to identify possible associations between clinical or echocardiographic parameters and the effect of HG on MR. MR increased during dynamic HG in 390 of 722 patients (54%) (∆EROA = 25%, ∆RVOL = 27%). Increase of regurgitation occurred in 66 of 132 patients with primary MR (50%) and in 324 of 580 patients with secondary MR (55%). This increase was associated with larger baseline EROA and RVOL, but it was independent from other clinical or echocardiographic parameters. In secondary MR, dynamic HG led to a reclassification of regurgitation severity from non-severe at rest to severe MR during HG in 104 of 375 patients (28%). There was a significant association between this upgrade in MR classification and higher New York Heart Association (NYHA) class (OR 1.486, 95%-CI 1.138-1.940, p = 0.004). Dynamic HG exercise increases MR in about half of patients independent of the etiology. Dynamic HG may be used to identify symptomatic patients with non-severe secondary MR at rest but severe MR during exercise.  
Recurrent germline mutations as genetic markers for aortic root dilatation in bicuspid aortic valve patients.  ;Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is characterized by elevated risk of aortic dilatation and aneurysm. Although genetic susceptibility is suspected to influence on the development of BAV aortopathy, clinical application of genetic markers still needs validation in BAV entities with strictly defined phenotypic features. The 'root phenotype' represents a young, male predominant, and severely aortic regurgitant BAV population prone to aortic root dilatation. The present study launched a two-step genetic survey to evaluate the clinical significance of germline genetic markers in BAV patients. The whole-exome sequencing (WES) cohort consisted of 13 BAV patients with 'root phenotype' under the age of 40 years. We identified 28 different heterozygous missense mutations in 19 genes from the WES cohort, among which six variants (COL1A2 R882C, COL5A1 I1161F, ACVRL1 R218W, NOTCH1 P1227S, MYLK S243W, MYLK D717Y) were identified as pathogenic variants via unanimous agreement of in silico prediction tool analysis, and three variants (C1R I345L, TGFBR2 V216I, FBN2 G475V) were identified as recurrent variants. The panel of nine genetic markers was tested in an independent validation cohort of 154 BAV patients consecutively included from January to May 2018 in our institution. The validation cohort demonstrated 71.4% male predominance and the average age of 57 ± 13 years, among which 26.6% showed aortic root dilatation and 66.9% ascending aortic dilatation. Genetic markers were found in 32 patients, including 18 with C1R I345L, 11 with TGFBR2 V216I, 2 with FBN2 G475V, and 1 with both TGFBR2 V216I and MYLK D717Y. BAV patients carrying these genetic markers demonstrated younger age [(51 ± 12) vs. (58 ± 13) years, P = 0.014], more moderate to severe aortic regurgitation (56.2% vs. 33.6%, P = 0.019), elevated prevalence of mitral valve prolapse (9.4% vs. 0.8%, P = 0.028) and aortic root dilatation (62.5% vs. 17.2%, P < 0.001) but not ascending aortic dilatation than those without these markers. The early-onset 'root phenotype' entities displayed great value for BAV genetic surveys. As one of the promising complements of the current risk stratification system, recurrent germline mutations in TGFBR2, C1R, FBN2 genes could be identified and applied as genetic markers of elevated susceptibility for aortic root but not ascending aortic dilatation among BAV patients.  
Tricuspid Valve Dysplasia at Fetal Autopsy.  ;Tricuspid valve abnormalities detected in fetal life include Ebstein anomaly and tricuspid valve dysplasia. The differentiation between these 2 entities can sometimes be challenging in the 2nd trimester fetus. We report a case of tricuspid valve dysplasia diagnosed on fetal autopsy. Case Report: A primigravida was diagnosed at 22 weeks' gestation to have Ebstein anomaly with severe tricuspid regurgitation. There was intra-uterine fetal demise. On fetal autopsy, the tricuspid valve leaflets were not apically displaced and the leaflets were nodular with rolled up edges. This supported a diagnosis of tricuspid valve dysplasia. Conclusion: The difficulties in differentiating Ebstein anomaly from tricuspid valve dysplasia due to inherent limitations in fetal imaging can be resolved by fetal autopsy. Valvular dysplasia will not have apical displacement of the valve leaflets.

Acquired left-to-right shunting through a valve-incompetent foramen ovale in a cat with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and congestive heart failure.  ;CASE SUMMARY: An 8-year-old spayed female domestic shorthair cat was presented for a recheck evaluation of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and chronic kidney disease. Three years prior to presentation, the patient was diagnosed with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and started on atenolol. The left ventricular outflow tract obstruction subsequently resolved. Biochemical analysis a week prior to presentation demonstrated severe azotemia. Transthoracic echocardiograph revealed pericardial effusion, pleural effusion, severe left ventricular concentric hypertrophy, severe left atrial enlargement and continuous left-to-right flow through the interatrial septum near the fossa ovalis. The patient was euthanized owing to poor prognosis, and gross examination at necropsy revealed a valve-incompetent patent foramen ovale secondary to severe left atrial dilation. RELEVANCE AND NOVEL INFORMATION: To our knowledge, this is the first report of an acquired left-to-right shunt through a valve-incompetent foramen ovale in a cat with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Severe left atrial dilation was suspected to cause interatrial shunting through the valve-incompetent foramen ovale, and this finding may be relevant to echocardiographic evaluations in other cats.  
Severe Aortic Stenosis and ATTRwt Amyloidosis - Beware in the Aging: A Case Report and Review of the Literature.  ;Degenerative aortic valve (AV) disease is the most frequent valvular heart disease slowly progressing to severe aortic stenosis (AS) which usually requires aortic valve replacement. Another frequent condition, especially among elderly people, is cardiac amyloidosis (CA), particularly the wild-type transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis (ATTRwt). Since both of these diseases are considered a marker of ageing, there is a significant proportion of elderly patients who associate both severe AS and CA. Recent studies reported a high prevalence of both severe AS and CA (AS-CA) in elderly patients referred for TAVR of 13-16%, carrying a worse prognosis. The present case illustrates the diagnostic algorithm and the management of ATTRwt CA in an elderly patient with severe paradoxical low-flow low-gradient AS, accompanied by a review of the current literature about the red flags which help identifying CA in patients with severe AS, as well as the prognosis and management of these disease association.  
Functional mitral regurgitation.  ;Dr. O.P. Yadava, Editor-in-Chief, IJTC, and Dr. J.L. Pomar, Former President, EACTS, discuss issues related to secondary mitral regurgitation (MR). Though it is considered a ventricular disease, mitral valve leaflets are not entirely normal. Alignment of subvalvular apparatus plays a more dominant role than annular dilatation. Early repair is preferred.  
Intra-operative trans-esophageal echocardiography in heart valve disease.  ;Peri-operative echocardiography is widely used because it provides information that significantly influences clinical/surgical management and improves outcome in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. The role of intra-operative trans-esophageal echocardiography (TEE) in valvular heart disease cannot be emphasized enough. Increasing use of newer surgical techniques-valve repairs and minimal invasive cardiac surgery also warrants intra-operative TEE. It gives us better insight into the anatomy and physiology of the valvular lesion by digital imaging. This manuscript provides an illustrative case based overview of intra operative TEE (IOTEE) in heart valve surgery.  
Management of the mitral valve in patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  ;Septal myectomy is the gold standard treatment option for patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy whose symptoms do not respond to medical therapy. This operation reliably relieves left ventricular outflow tract gradients, systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve, and associated mitral valve regurgitation. However, there remains controversy regarding the necessity of mitral valve intervention at the time of septal myectomy. While some clinicians advocate for concomitant mitral valve procedures, others strongly believe that the mitral valve should only be operated on if there is intrinsic mitral valve disease. At Mayo Clinic, we have performed septal myectomy on more than 3000 patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and in our experience, mitral valve operation is rarely necessary for patients who do not have intrinsic mitral valve disease such as leaflet prolapse or severe calcific stenosis. In this paper, we review anatomical considerations, imaging, and surgical approaches in the management of the mitral valve in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  
Contemporary techniques for mitral valve repair-the Mayo Clinic experience.  ;Mitral valve repair for patients with degenerative or functional mitral valve regurgitation improves symptoms and prognosis, and several techniques have been described. Important principles in operation are simplicity, reproducibility, and durability of repair. At Mayo Clinic, we have operated on more than 6000 patients with degenerative mitral valve disease and valve prolapse, and this review details our approach to mitral valve repair, including robotic and minimally invasive techniques. Most patients with isolated leaflet prolapse can be managed with leaflet plication or triangular resection, and chordal replacement is reserved for repair of anterior leaflet prolapse. Posterior annuloplasty with a standard-sized flexible band is used to reduce annular circumference and improve leaflet coaptation. With these methods, early risk of mortality for mitral valve repair is low in the current era (< 1%), and rate of recurrent valve leakage is 1.5 per 100 patient-years during the first year post-repair and 0.9 per 100 patient-years thereafter. This paper also briefly summarizes important considerations for patients with mitral valve regurgitation and severe calcification, perforations due to endocarditis, and rheumatic heart disease.  
Mitral valve repair for degenerative mitral valve regurgitation.  ;In industrialized countries, the most common etiology of mitral regurgitation (MR) is degenerative mitral valve (MV) disease. The natural history of severe degenerative MR is poor. However, its appropriate and timely correction is associated with a life expectancy similar to that of the normal population. Surgical MV repair is the gold-standard treatment. This review will focus on the most recent evidence with a specific emphasis on surgical indications, timing of treatment, contemporary surgical techniques, Heart Teams, and Centers of Excellence.  
Immediate, early and mid-term outcomes following balloon mitral valvotomy in patients having severe rheumatic mitral stenosis with significant tricuspid regurgitation.  ;BACKGROUND: The study examined the influence of significant tricuspid regurgitation (TR) on the immediate, early and mid-term outcomes of patients with severe mitral stenosis (MS) undergoing balloon mitral valvotomy (BMV). METHODS: Among the 818 consecutive patients who underwent elective BMV in this institute from 1997 to 2003, 114 had significant TR. After propensity score-matched analysis, the data of 93 patients with significant TR were compared with the data of 93 patients who had no significant TR at the baseline. Outcomes were assessed immediately, at 1 year (early) and at 5 years (mid-term) after BMV. RESULTS: Patients with significant TR presented more frequently with NYHA class III-IV status, atrial fibrillation (AF), severe pulmonary hypertension (PH), advanced mitral valve disease as assessed by echocardiographic score > 8, and with history of previous BMV. After propensity score-matched analysis, it was found that the immediate procedural success (54.8% vs. 58.1%, P = 0.650), immediate in-hospital events and prevalence of AF and heart failure at 1 year of follow-up were comparable between the two groups. At 5 years after BMV, the significant TR group had higher prevalence of heart failure and AF, greater attrition in mitral valve area (MVA) and higher pulmonary artery (PA) pressure. CONCLUSIONS: Significant TR identifies a sicker patient population with MS. Even though patients with significant TR have comparable immediate and early outcomes after BMV, they have poor outcomes on mid-term follow-up. Longer follow-up with more patients is needed to assess survival aspect of TR on patients undergoing BMV and also to look at the need for interventions to address the significant TR, apart from the mitral valve interventions.  
Adult congenital heart disease: frequency, risk factors and outcomes of acute kidney injury in postoperative period.  ;"BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) after surgery for congenital heart disease (CHD) in adults is poorly studied despite being well-recognized as a postoperative complication after cardiac surgery in adults. The primary aim of our study was to determine the frequency of AKI in adults undergoing surgery for CHD. We also aimed to determine risk factors and predictors of AKI in this patient population, and to explore outcomes in terms of duration of mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and hospital stay. METHODS: This retrospective cross-sectional study included all adult patients (18 years) who underwent cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass for their congenital heart problems from January 2011 to December 2016 in a tertiary-care private hospital. RESULTS: A total of 166 patients with a mean age of 32.05 ± 12.11 years were included in this study. The postoperative course was complicated by AKI in 29.5% of patients. Thirty-two percent of these patients had moderate-to-severe kidney disease. Two patients (4%) developing AKI required renal replacement therapy in the form of transient hemodialysis. All patients in our study showed complete resolution of AKI, with no mortalities in the postoperative period. On univariable analysis, (Risk adjusted classification for congenital heart surgery-1) RACHS-1 category 2 and 3, aortic valve replacement, preoperative creatinine clearance, ventricular septal defect closure, cardiopulmonary bypass time, aortic cross-clamp time, intra-operative excessive blood loss, intra-operative ionotropic score, and postoperative hypotension were found to be significant predictors for the development of AKI. On age-adjusted multivariable analysis, RACHS-1 category 2 (OR = 3.49; CI = 1.22-9.95) and category 3 (OR = 3.28 = 1.15-9.36), and intra-operative excessive blood loss (OR = 2.9; CI = 1.07-7.85) were significant predictors of AKI development in the postoperative period. Moreover, development of AKI postoperatively was a predictor of a significantly longer cardiac intensive care unit (CICU) stay (OR = 1.21; CI = 1.08-1.37). CONCLUSION: We found that preoperative creatinine clearance, ACC time, intraoperative excessive blood loss, and RACHS-1Category 2 and 3 are potential risk factors for postoperative AKI development. Moreover, patients who develop AKI are likely to have a significantly longer CICU stay. Our study has tried to fill the lacunae with regard to AKI in adults undergoing surgery for CHD. However, there is a need for more studies with larger cohorts involving more complex surgeries to truly estimate the incidence and potential risk factors for AKI in this group of patients.  "
Octogenarians and aortic valve surgery: surgical outcomes in the geriatric population.  ;BACKGROUND: The era of percutaneous aortic valve intervention has challenged the continuing indication for surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). AIM: The aim of this study is to evaluate clinical outcomes of the elderly patients who underwent surgical aortic valve replacement via median sternotomy, in order to assess the impact of surgery on patient outcomes and discharge destination. METHODS: The study involves a retrospective observational analysis in a single centre, including all octogenarian patients who underwent aortic valve surgery between January of 2011 and July of 2016. The study assessed pre-operative co-morbidities and post-operative outcomes, including long-term mortality and discharge destination following on from surgery. RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 82.7 years (± 2.9), 67% of whom were male. The mean EuroSCORE II was 8.1 (± 7.6). The most common pre-operative co-morbidities were dyslipidaemia (82%), hypertension (80%), and ischaemic heart disease (78.8%). The median length of stay was 10 days (± 6.9 days). Discharge home occurred in 71.8% of patients, with 21.2% of patients requiring transfer to a rehabilitation facility, and 1.2% of patients required placement into an aged care facility. There were five peri-operative deaths, equating to 5.9% of the cohort. CONCLUSION: Despite high EuroSCORE II values for the majority of our patients, our data adds to overall suggestions that the octogenarian population can be considered eligible for SAVR and should not be excluded due to age alone. The use of the EuroSCORE II index more accurately predicts adequacy for treatment however does not entirely predict overall course of events, and proceduralist discretion should still be used.  
Porcine versus bovine bioprosthetic valves in mitral position: does choice really matter?  ;BACKGROUND: Bioprosthetic valves are increasingly used for surgical mitral valve replacement (MVR). The long-term outcomes of bovine (BoMVR) vs porcine (PoMVR) remain an enigma regarding the durability. This study aims to examine the outcomes of BoMVR vs PoMVR. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of all bioprosthetic MVRs, with concomitant procedures, at a single tertiary referral institution from January 2005 to December 2008 was conducted. Procedures were classified as BoMVR or PoMVR. The age group was from 40 to 70 years. RESULTS: We identified 154 BoMVR patients and 120 PoMVR patients after matching the two groups with respect to age, sex, valve size and concomitant procedures. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis model was used for corresponding statistical analysis. Freedom from reoperation (all cause), freedom from non-structural valve deterioration, freedom from structural valve deterioration, freedom from heart failure and freedom from infective endocarditis were 96.4 ± 0.08, 97.1 ± 0.07, 96.4 ± 0.08%, 98.2 ± 0.07, and 98.6 ± 0.06% in PoMVR, respectively, and 92.6 ± 0.09, 91.6 ± 0.08, 90.6 ± 0.09, 94 ± 0.08, and 92.8 ± 0.08% in BoMVR groups, respectively, at the end of 10-year follow-up (mean follow up of 6.2 ± 2.3 years). Overall, 20 (12.9%) patients were lost to follow-up in the BoMVR and 15(12.5%) patients in the PoMVR groups for a global follow-up of 87.1%. CONCLUSIONS: For patients undergoing MVR with a bioprosthetic valve, the choice of PoMVR vs BoMVR favours more in favour of PoMVR as evidenced by the outcome results. Probably long-term follow-up with more patients might throw further light on the debatable topic.  
Ebstein's anomaly presenting with the acute coronary syndrome-a rare combination.  ;Ebstein's anomaly is a relatively rare congenital heart disorder characterised by downward displacement of septal and posterior leaflets of the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle cavity. The usual presenting symptoms are cyanosis, right-sided heart failure and arrhythmia. Progressive heart failure or tachyarrhythmia may worsen cyanosis. The acute coronary syndrome is rarely reported in Ebstein's anomaly. We report a patient of undiagnosed Ebstein's anomaly who was apparently asymptomatic but presented with the acute coronary syndrome. This case report deals with a rare combination of congenital heart disease (Ebstein's anomaly) and coronary artery disease. Ebstein's anomaly (EA) has a prevalence of 1% of all congenital heart diseases, and little evidence is reported in the literature where EA along with coronary artery disease (CAD) exists in individuals less than 45 years old. Therefore, this case report brings attention to the rarity of those pathologies, which individually are already considered rare. And in this case, the association turns this diagnosis exceptional and highlights the complexity of the treatment.  
Implantation of Impella CP left ventricular assist device under the guidance of three-dimensional intracardiac echocardiography.  ;Impella CP is a percutaneously inserted left ventricular assist device indicated for temporary mechanical cardiac support during high risk percutaneous coronary interventions and for cardiogenic shock. The potential application of Impella has become particularly relevant during the current COVID-19 pandemic, for patients with acute severe heart failure complicating viral illness. Standard implantation of the Impella CP is performed under fluoroscopic guidance. Positioning of the Impella CP can be confirmed with transthoracic or transoesophageal echocardiography. We describe an alternative approach to guide intracardiac implantation of the Impella CP using two-dimensional and three-dimensional intracardiac echocardiography. This new technique can be useful in selected groups of patients when fluoroscopy, transthoracic and transoesophageal echocardiography is deemed inapplicable or limited for epidemiological or clinical reasons. Intracardiac three-dimensional echocardiography is a feasible alternative to the traditional techniques for implantation of an Impella CP device but careful consideration must be given to the potential limitations and complications of this technique.  
Three-Dimensional Imaging and Dynamic Modeling of Systolic Anterior Motion of the Mitral Valve.  ;Left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is often caused by systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the mitral valve caused by the interplay between increased left ventricular (LV) wall thickness and an abnormal mitral valve anatomy and geometry. Three-dimensional (3D) echocardiographic imaging of the mitral valve has revolutionized the practice of cardiology, paving the way for new methods to see and treat valvular heart disease. Here we present the novel and incremental value of 3D transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) of SAM visualization. This review first provides step-by-step instructions on acquiring and optimizing 3D TEE imaging of SAM. It then describes the unique and novel findings using standard 3D TEE rendering as well as dynamic mitral valve modeling of SAM from 3D data sets, which can provide a more detailed visualization of SAM features. The findings include double-orifice LVOT caused by the residual leaflet, the dolphin smile phenomenon, and delineation of SAM width. Finally, the review discusses the essential role of 3D TEE imaging for preprocedural assessment and intraprocedural guidance of surgical and novel percutaneous treatments of SAM.  
Structural Valve Deterioration at 5 Years of TAVR Versus SAVR: Half Full or Half Empty?  ;DOI: 10.1016/j.jacc.2020.09.009 PMID: 33059829  
Swallowing and Communication Management of Tracheostomy and Laryngectomy in the Context of COVID-19: A Review.  ;"IMPORTANCE: The care of patients with a surgically modified airway, such as tracheostomy or laryngectomy, represents a challenge for speech-language pathologists (SLPs) in the context of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The objective was to review available publications and practice guidelines on management of tracheostomy and laryngectomy in the context of COVID-19. This study performed a review and synthesis of information available in the PubMed database and from national SLP organizations across 6 countries. OBSERVATIONS: From the search, 22 publications on tracheostomy and 3 referring to laryngectomy were identified. After analysis of titles and abstracts followed by full-text review, 4 publications were identified as presenting guidelines for specific approaches to tracheostomy and were selected; all 3 publications on laryngectomy were selected. The main guidelines on tracheostomy described considerations during management (eg, cuff manipulation, suctioning, valve placement) owing to the increased risk of aerosol generation and transmission during swallowing and communication interventions in this population. Regarding laryngectomy, the guidelines focused on the care and protection of both the professional and the patient, offering recommendations on the management of adverse events and leakage of the tracheoesophageal prosthesis. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Frequent guideline updates for SLPs are necessary to inform best practice and ensure patient and health care worker protection and safety while providing high-quality care and rehabilitation.

Inappropriate cathepsin K secretion promotes its enzymatic activation driving heart and valve malformation.  ;Although congenital heart defects (CHDs) represent the most common birth defect, a comprehensive understanding of disease etiology remains unknown. This is further complicated since CHDs can occur in isolation or as a feature of another disorder. Analyzing disorders with associated CHDs provides a powerful platform to identify primary pathogenic mechanisms driving disease. Aberrant localization and expression of cathepsin proteases can perpetuate later-stage heart diseases, but their contribution toward CHDs is unclear. To investigate the contribution of cathepsins during cardiovascular development and congenital disease, we analyzed the pathogenesis of cardiac defects in zebrafish models of the lysosomal storage disorder mucolipidosis II (MLII). MLII is caused by mutations in the GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase enzyme (Gnptab) that disrupt carbohydrate-dependent sorting of lysosomal enzymes. Without Gnptab, lysosomal hydrolases, including cathepsin proteases, are inappropriately secreted. Analyses of heart development in gnptab-deficient zebrafish show cathepsin K secretion increases its activity, disrupts TGF-β-related signaling, and alters myocardial and valvular formation. Importantly, cathepsin K inhibition restored normal heart and valve development in MLII embryos. Collectively, these data identify mislocalized cathepsin K as an initiator of cardiac disease in this lysosomal disorder and establish cathepsin inhibition as a viable therapeutic strategy.  
Surgical management of Staphylococcus capitis prosthetic valve infective endocarditis: Retrospective review of a 10-year single center experience and review of the literature.  ;BACKGROUND: Staphylococcus capitis (S. capitis) is a subtype of coagulase-negative staphylococci and a commensal of the skin of the human scalp and forehead. S. capitis has been occasionally reported in infective endocarditis and rarely in prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE). The purpose of this report is to present the clinical course and the surgical management of a series of four patients with S. capitis PVE. METHODS: The medical records of 190 adult patients with a definite diagnosis of infective endocarditis by the Duke modified criteria and who underwent surgery at our center between January 2008 and December 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: There were four cases of S. capitis infective endocarditis among 190 patients. All were male with an average age of 70.25 years (range, 58-80 years). The four cases were PVE: 3 aortic (1 mechanical and 2 biological bioprostheses) and 1 mitral (bioprosthesis). Their mean Euroscore II was 32.43 (range, 9.19-50.8). Three patients had underlying diseases (diabetes mellitus=2, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease=3, chronic kidney disease=1, peripheral arterial disease=2, ischemic heart disease=1, dilated cardiomyopathy=1). Preoperative clinical presentation was characterized by the occurrence of sepsis in three patients and heart failure and sepsis in one patient. Two patients presented with vegetation (mitral bioprosthesis, aortic bioprosthesis). A prosthetic dehiscence was present in all patients, and two presented with a localized annular abscess. All but one patient received triple antibiotic treatment with vancomycin plus rifampicin plus gentamycin. Surgery was performed on an urgent basis in all patients, and the in-hospital mortality rate was 50%. CONCLUSIONS: While limited by the small number of patients, our series highlights the aggressive clinical course of S. capitis PVE with a mortality rate close to that of Staphylococcus aureus PVE. Therefore, early surgical management is recommended to improve the clinical outcome of this serious disease.  
Comparison of Self-Expanding Bioprostheses for Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in Patients with Symptomatic Severe Aortic Stenosis: The SCOPE 2 Randomized Clinical Trial.  ;"Background: There are few randomized trials comparing bioprostheses for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), and no trials compared TAVR bioprostheses with supra-annular design. The SCOPE 2 trial was designed to compare the clinical outcomes of the ACURATE neo and CoreValve Evolut valves. Methods: SCOPE 2 was a randomized trial performed at 23 centers in 6 countries between April 2017 and April 2019. Patients ≥75 years with an indication for transfemoral TAVR as agreed by the Heart Team were randomly assigned to receive treatment with either the ACURATE neo (n=398) or the CoreValve Evolut bioprostheses (n=398). The primary endpoint, powered for non-inferiority of the ACURATE neo valve, was all-cause death or stroke at 1 year. The key secondary endpoint, powered for superiority of the ACURATE neo valve, was new permanent pacemaker implantation at 30 days. Results: Among 796 randomized patients (mean age 83.2±4.3 years; mean STS-PROM score 4.6± 2.9%), clinical follow-up information was available for 778 (98%) patients. Within 1 year, the primary endpoint occurred in 15.8% of patients in the ACURATE neo group and in 13.9% of patients in the CoreValve Evolut group (absolute risk difference 1.8%, upper one-sided 95% confidence limit 6.1%, p=0.0549 for noninferiority). The 30-day rates of new permanent pacemaker implantation were 10.5% in the ACURATE neo group and 18.0% in the CoreValve Evolut group (absolute risk difference -7.5%, 95% confidence interval -12.4 to -2.60, p=0.0027). No significant differences were observed in the components of the primary endpoint. Cardiac death at 30 days (2.8% vs. 0.8%, p=0.03) and 1 year (8.4% vs. 3.9%, p=0.01), and moderate or severe aortic regurgitation at 30 days (10% vs. 3%, p=0.002) were significantly increased in the ACURATE neo group. Conclusions: Transfemoral TAVR with the self-expanding ACURATE neo did not meet non-inferiority compared to the self-expanding CoreValve Evolut in terms of all-cause death or stroke at 1 year, and was associated with a lower incidence of new permanent pacemaker implantation. In secondary analyses, the ACURATE neo was associated with more moderate or severe aortic regurgitation at 30 days and cardiac death at 30 days and 1 year.

Reporting incidental coronary, aortic valve and cardiac calcification on non-gated thoracic computed tomography, a consensus statement from the BSCI/BSCCT and BSTI.  ;Incidental coronary and cardiac calcification are frequent findings on non-gated thoracic CT. We recommend that the heart is reviewed on all CT scans where it is visualised. Coronary artery calcification is a marker of coronary artery disease and it is associated with an adverse prognosis on dedicated cardiac imaging and on non-gated thoracic CT performed for non-cardiac indications, both with and without contrast. We recommend that coronary artery calcification is reported on all non-gated thoracic CT using a simple patient-based score (none, mild, moderate, severe). Furthermore, we recommend that reports include recommendations for subsequent management, namely the assessment of modifiable cardiovascular risk factors and, if the patient has chest pain, assessment as per standard guidelines. In most cases, this will not necessitate additional investigations. Incidental aortic valve calcification may also be identified on non-gated thoracic CT and should be reported, along with ancillary findings such as aortic root dilation. Calcification may occur in other parts of the heart including mitral valve/annulus, pericardium and myocardium, but in many cases these are an incidental finding without clinical significance.  
[Tumor effects on the heart and circulation].  ;As a result of the continuous development of modern cancer treatment, more cancer patients can be cured every year. However, since many patients experience cardiovascular problems before, during and after their cancer treatment, cardio-oncology is becoming increasingly important. Numerous therapies can cause cardiotoxicity, such as chemotherapy, immunotherapy, antibody therapy and radiotherapy. If these remain undetected, the patient may develop, e.g. heart failure or severe heart valve damage. The broad spectrum of cardiovascular comorbidities has become an immense challenge for cardiologists and oncologists. Cardio-oncology also deals with the effects that cancer has on the cardiovascular system. New research indicates that the tumor itself also has direct negative effects on the heart, mediated by messenger substances. Therefore, it is important to understand which cancer patients are at increased cardiovascular risk, thereby enabling the development of new therapeutic approaches in the long term to maintain mobility and improve patient prognosis.  
Predictors of outcomes in patients with mitral regurgitation undergoing percutaneous valve repair.  ;Percutaneous mitral valve repair has been increasingly performed worldwide after approval. We sought to investigate predictors of clinical outcome in patients with mitral regurgitation undergoing percutaneous valve repair. The MITRA-UMG study, a single-centre registry, retrospectively collected consecutive patients with symptomatic moderate-to-severe or severe MR undergoing MitraClip therapy. The primary endpoint was the composite of cardiovascular death or rehospitalization for heart failure. Between March 2012 and July 2018, a total of 150 consecutive patients admitted to our institution were included. Procedural success was obtained in 95.3% of patients. The composite primary endpoint of cardiovascular death or rehospitalization for HF was met in 55 patients (37.9%) with cumulative incidences of 7.6%, 26.2%, at 30 days and 1-year, respectively. In the Cox multivariate model, NYHA functional class and left ventricular end-diastolic volume index (LVEDVi), independently increased the risk of the primary endpoint at long-term follow-up. At Kaplan-Meier analysis, a LVEDVi > 92 ml/m2 was associated with an increased incidence of the primary endpoint. In this study, patients presenting with dilated ventricles (LVEDVi > 92 ml/m2) and advanced heart failure symptoms (NYHA IV) at baseline carried the worst prognosis after percutaneous mitral valve repair.  
Bicuspid aortic valve: different clinical profiles for subjects with versus without repaired aortic coarctation.  ;"OBJECTIVES: A small proportion of patients undergoing bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) intervention have had prior repair of aortic coarctation (CoA). We aimed to describe phenotypic differences between BAV patients, comparing those with versus those without previous coarctation repair. METHODS: 556 adults with BAV who had undergone aortic valve and/or ascending aortic surgery were identified, and relevant clinical and operative details were retrospectively analysed. RESULTS: Of the total cohort, 532 patients (95.7%) had isolated BAV ('BAV-only'), and 24 (4.3%) had had a previous successful CoA repair ('BAV-CoA'). The median age at surgery was significantly lower in BAV-CoA patients compared with BAV-only (median, IQR: 40 years, 26-57 vs 62 years, 51-69, p<0.001). Indications for surgery also differed, with BAV-CoA patients much more likely to undergo surgery for aortic regurgitation (BAV-CoA 38% vs BAV-only 13%, p<0.001); patients with isolated BAV were more likely to require surgery for aortic stenosis (BAV-only 75% vs BAV-CoA 50%, p<0.001). Two different BAV morphotypes were commoner in the BAV-CoA group; type 0 valves (24% vs 8%, p<0.05) and type 2 valves (12% vs 3%, p<0.05). The proportion of patients undergoing concomitant aortic surgery at the time of valve surgery were similar (BAV-only 38% vs BAV-CoA 42%, p=0.8). CONCLUSION: In adult patients undergoing aortic valve surgery for BAV disease, those with a prior history of repaired CoA underwent surgery at a very much younger age, and a higher proportion required intervention for aortic regurgitation.

Troponin T but not C reactive protein is associated with future surgery for aortic stenosis: a population-based nested case-referent study.  ;AIMS: High-sensitivity troponin T (hs-TnT) and high-sensitivity C reactive protein (hs-CRP) may convey prognostic information in patients with aortic stenosis (AS). This study evaluated if hs-TnT and hs-CRP associate with myocardial mass, and risk of future surgery for AS. METHODS: In total, 336 patients (48% women) with surgery for AS with previous participation in large population surveys were identified. Preoperatively, myocardial mass and the presence of coronary artery disease (CAD) were assessed. Two matched referents were allocated for each case, and hs-TnT and hs-CRP were determined in stored plasma from the baseline survey. Conditional logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the risk (OR (95% CI)) related to one (natural logarithm) SD increase in hs-TnT and hs-CRP. Kaplan-Mayer and Cox regression analyses were used to evaluate time to surgery. RESULTS: Median age (IQR) was 59.8 (10.3) years at survey, and median time between survey and surgery was 10.9 (9.3) years. Hs-TnT was independently associated with surgery for AS (1.24 (1.06-1.44)) irrespective of CAD, whereas Hs-CRP was not (1.05 (0.90-1.22)). Elevated hs-TnT levels at survey associated with shorter time to surgery (p<0.001), and with increased myocardial mass (p=0.002). Hs-CRP did not associate with time to surgery or with myocardial mass. CONCLUSIONS: Hs-TnT-but not hs-CRP-was associated with increased risk of-and shorter time to-future surgery for AS. Hs-TnT associated with myocardial mass at surgery which indicates that hs-TnT could be a potential biomarker for determining intervention.  
Echocardiographic versus angiographic measurement of the aortic valve annulus in children undergoing balloon aortic valvuloplasty: method affects outcomes.  ;"OBJECTIVE: Operators are mindful of the balloon-to-aortic annulus ratio when performing balloon aortic valvuloplasty. The method of measurement of the aortic valve annulus has not been standardised. METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients who underwent aortic valvuloplasty at two paediatric centres between 2007 and 2014 were included. The valve annulus measured by echocardiography and angiography was used to calculate the balloon-to-aortic annulus ratio and measurements were compared. The primary endpoint was an increase in aortic insufficiency by ≥2 degrees. Ninety-eight patients with a median age at valvuloplasty of 2.1 months (Interquartile range (IQR): 0.2-105.5) were included. The angiographic-based annulus was 8.2 mm (IQR: 6.8-16.0), which was greater than echocardiogram-based annulus of 7.5 mm (IQR: 6.1-14.8) (p < 0.001). This corresponded to a significantly lower angiographic balloon-to-aortic annulus ratio of 0.9 (IQR: 0.9-1.0), compared to an echocardiographic ratio of 1.1 (IQR: 1.0-1.1) (p < 0.001). The degree of discrepancy in measured diameter increased with smaller valve diameters (p = 0.041) and in neonates (p = 0.044). There was significant disagreement between angiographic and echocardiographic balloon-to-aortic annulus ratio measures regarding ""High"" ratio of >1.2, with angiographic ratio flagging only 2/12 (16.7%) of patients flagged by echocardiographic ratio as ""High"" (p = 0.012). Patients who had an increase in the degree of aortic insufficiency post valvuloplasty, only 3 (5.5%) had angiographic ratio > 1.1, while 21 (38%) had echocardiographic ratio >1.1 (p < 0.001). Patients with resultant ≥ moderate insufficiency more often had an echocardiographic ratio of >1.1 than angiographic ratio of >1.1 There was no association between increase in balloon-to-aortic annulus ratio and gradient reduction. CONCLUSIONS: Angiographic measurement is associated with a greater measured aortic valve annulus and the development of aortic insufficiency. Operators should use caution when relying solely on angiographic measurement when performing balloon aortic valvuloplasty.  "
Ultrastructural Pathology of Atherosclerosis, Calcific Aortic Valve Disease, and Bioprosthetic Heart Valve Degeneration: Commonalities and Differences.  ;Atherosclerosis, calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD), and bioprosthetic heart valve degeneration (alternatively termed structural valve deterioration, SVD) represent three diseases affecting distinct components of the circulatory system and their substitutes, yet sharing multiple risk factors and commonly leading to the extraskeletal calcification. Whereas the histopathology of the mentioned disorders is well-described, their ultrastructural pathology is largely obscure due to the lack of appropriate investigation techniques. Employing an original method for sample preparation and the electron microscopy visualisation of calcified cardiovascular tissues, here we revisited the ultrastructural features of lipid retention, macrophage infiltration, intraplaque/intraleaflet haemorrhage, and calcification which are common or unique for the indicated types of cardiovascular disease. Atherosclerotic plaques were notable for the massive accumulation of lipids in the extracellular matrix (ECM), abundant macrophage content, and pronounced neovascularisation associated with blood leakage and calcium deposition. In contrast, CAVD and SVD generally did not require vasculo- or angiogenesis to occur, instead relying on fatigue-induced ECM degradation and the concurrent migration of immune cells. Unlike native tissues, bioprosthetic heart valves contained numerous specialised macrophages and were not capable of the regeneration that underscores ECM integrity as a pivotal factor for SVD prevention. While atherosclerosis, CAVD, and SVD show similar pathogenesis patterns, these disorders demonstrate considerable ultrastructural differences.  
The Prospects of Secondary Moderate Mitral Regurgitation after Aortic Valve Replacement -Meta-Analysis.  ;"Aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis represents one of the most frequent surgical procedures on heart valves. These patients often have concomitant mitral regurgitation. To reveal whether the moderate mitral regurgitation will improve after aortic valve replacement alone, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis. We identified 27 studies with 4452 patients that underwent aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis and had co-existent mitral regurgitation. Primary end point was the impact of aortic valve replacement on the concomitant mitral regurgitation. Secondary end points were the analysis of the left ventricle reverse remodeling and long-term survival. Our results showed that there was significant improvement in mitral regurgitation postoperatively (RR, 1.65; 95% CI 1.36-2.00; p < 0.00001) with the average decrease of 0.46 (WMD; 95% CI 0.35-0.57; p < 0.00001). The effect is more pronounced in the elderly population. Perioperative mortality was higher (p < 0.0001) and long-term survival significantly worse (p < 0.00001) in patients that had moderate/severe mitral regurgitation preoperatively. We conclude that after aortic valve replacement alone there are fair chances but for only slight improvement in concomitant mitral regurgitation. The secondary moderate mitral regurgitation should be addressed at the time of aortic valve replacement. A more conservative approach should be followed for elderly and high-risk patients.  "
The Safety and Efficacy of Transcatheter Pulmonary Valve Replacement Combined with Electrophysiology Procedures.  ;"The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of combining transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement (TPVR) and electrophysiology (EP) procedures. A retrospective review was undertaken to identify TPVR and EP procedures that were concomitantly performed in the cardiac catheterization laboratory at University of Iowa Stead Family Children's Hospital from January 2011 to October 2019. Procedural and follow-up data were compared between patients who underwent TPVR and EP procedures in the same setting to those who received TPVR or EP procedure separately and that were similar in age and cardiac anatomy. A total of 8 patients underwent combined TPVR and EP procedures. One patient was excluded due to lack of adequate control, leaving seven study subjects (57% female; median age at time of procedure 16 years). The median follow-up time was 11.5 months (range 2-36 months). Patients who received combined TPVR and EP had shorter recovery times (combined: median 18.9 h; IQR 18.35-19.5 vs separate: median 27.98 h; IQR 21.42-39.25; p-value 0.031), shorter hospital length of stay (combined: median 27.5 h; IQR 26.47-31.4 vs separate: median 38.4 h; IQR 33.42-51.50; p-value 0.016), and a 51% reduction in total hospital charges (combined: median $171,640; IQR 135.43-219.22 vs separate: median $333,560 IQR 263.20-400.98; p-value 0.016). There were no significant differences in radiation dose or procedure time between the combined and control groups. The median radiation time for those who had the combination procedure was 30.5 min [IQR 29.6-47.9], and the median dose area product was 215 mGy [IQR 158-935]. In conclusion, combining TPVR and EP procedures is feasible, safe, and economically advantageous.

Percutaneous mitral valve leaflet repair: ongoing directions and future perspectives.  ;Percutaneous mitral valve leaflet repair has revolutionized the treatment of heart failure patients with secondary mitral regurgitation, as well as it offers a valuable alternative to surgery for high risk patients with degenerative disease. More than one device is now available for leaflet repair, broadening the indications and improving outcomes, as well as complicating the decision-making algorithms. In the last two years, several trials and registries have enriched the evidence around these procedures, although many questions remain open. Two major clinical trials have provided opposing evidence, confirming that this field of cardiovascular medicine remains controversial. Probably, the challenge remains with the human factor: achieving optimal outcomes remains a challenge, highly depending on patient selection, timing and procedural details. Operator dependent factors are emerging as a key element, not unexpectedly, to achieve procedural excellence. Besides large randomized controlled trials, there is a large amount of knowledge emerging from real world registries. The review focus on what we can learn from registries and single center experiences as a complement to the large randomized trials.  
Combined valve replacement and aortocoronary bypass in an adult mucopolysaccharidosis type VII patient.  ;"Mucopolysaccharidosis type VII (MPS VII) is a rare autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder. MPS VII is caused by mutations in the GUSB gene that encodes β-glucuronidase. Adult MPS VII patients present with musculoskeletal abnormalities, coarse features, and corneal clouding. Cardiac and valvular impairment are common; however, severe valvular disease necessitating surgery has not yet been reported. We present a 32-year-old male MPS VII patient admitted to our hospital with decompensated heart failure. We identified aortic valve disease with severe stenosis (valve area 0.69 cm2) and moderate regurgitation. Severe mitral valve stenosis (valve area 1 cm2) with moderate to severe regurgitation was also found in the patient. In addition, an occlusion of the right coronary artery (RCA) was documented. The patient underwent surgical replacement of the mitral and aortic valves with mechanical prostheses and implantation of a venous bypass graft to his RCA. The surgery led to a significant improvement of his clinical symptoms. Six months after the procedure, both mechanical valves function normally. Histopathological assessment identified chronic inflammatory infiltrates, fibrosis and calcifications in both resected valves. Foamy cytoplasmic transformation was most evident in the valvular interstitial cells. The ultrastructural vacuolar abnormality seen in these cells corresponded to storage changes observed in other MPSs. In conclusion, we describe clinical findings and valvular pathology in an MPS VII patient with the first-reported successful combined surgical valve replacement and myocardial revascularization. The histological and ultrastructural analyses revealed that the lysosomal storage predominantly affected the valvular interstitial cells.  "
Vascular dissection in women with Turner syndrome.  ;BACKGROUND: The frequency of ascending aortic dissection in patients with Turner syndrome in the United States remains largely unknown with data surmised from published case reports or case series. Dissection of other vascular structures has only rarely been reported in this patient cohort. Recent European data identified aortic dissection to be a relatively rare event in a group of adult women with Turner syndrome. We sought to evaluate the prevalence of, and risk factors for, vascular dissection in women with Turner syndrome followed in the United States. METHOD: Retrospective review of all adult patients (age > 18 years) with Turner syndrome seen by any medical care provider within 2 medical systems covering a 5 state referral base was performed. Demographic, clinical, surgical and imaging variables of interest were recorded. RESULTS: Vascular dissection occurred in 16 (4.1%) of the 393 adult women and prophylactic aortic replacement occurred in 14 (3.5%). Only 35% of patients were under the care of a cardiologist with the remainder followed exclusively by other care providers. Vascular dissections occurred in the ascending & descending aorta as well as pulmonary artery and cerebral vessels. In addition to bicuspid aortic valve, and prior cardiac surgery, risk factors for vascular dissection included rural residence and lack of ongoing care by a cardiologist. CONCLUSION: Transition to adult cardiology subspecialty care is lacking in patients with Turner syndrome. Aortic dissection is not uncommon. Ongoing interaction with a cardiologist is essential to optimize cardiac outcomes in those with cardiac risk factors and may best be accomplished with centralized multidisciplinary clinics.  
A randomized clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban in patients with bioprosthetic mitral valve and atrial fibrillation or flutter: Rationale and design of the RIVER trial.  ;"BACKGROUND: The efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban in patients with bioprosthetic mitral valves and atrial fibrillation or flutter remain uncertain. DESIGN: RIVER was an academic-led, multicenter, open-label, randomized, non-inferiority trial with blinded outcome adjudication that enrolled 1005 patients from 49 sites in Brazil. Patients with a bioprosthetic mitral valve and atrial fibrillation or flutter were randomly assigned (1:1) to rivaroxaban 20mg once daily (15mg in those with creatinine clearance <50mL/min) or dose-adjusted warfarin (target international normalized ratio 2.0-30.); the follow-up period was 12months. The primary outcome was a composite of all-cause mortality, stroke, transient ischemic attack, major bleeding, valve thrombosis, systemic embolism, or hospitalization for heart failure. Secondary outcomes included individual components of the primary composite outcome, bleeding events, and venous thromboembolism. SUMMARY: RIVER represents the largest trial specifically designed to assess the efficacy and safety of a direct oral anticoagulant in patients with bioprosthetic mitral valves and atrial fibrillation or flutter. The results of this trial can inform clinical practice and international guidelines.  "
Long-Term Outcomes After Infective Endocarditis After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.  ;DOI: 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.120.047469 PMID: 33044863  
Overall and Cause-Specific Mortality in Randomized Clinical Trials Comparing Percutaneous Interventions With Coronary Bypass Surgery: A Meta-analysis.  ;"IMPORTANCE: Mortality is a common outcome in trials comparing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Controversy exists regarding whether all-cause mortality or cardiac mortality is preferred as a study end point, because noncardiac mortality should be unrelated to the treatment. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the difference in all-cause and cause-specific mortality in randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing PCI with CABG for the treatment of patients with coronary artery disease. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE (1946 to the present), Embase (1974 to the present), and the Cochrane Library (1992 to the present) databases were searched on November 24, 2019. Reference lists of included articles were also searched, and additional studies were included if appropriate. STUDY SELECTION: Articles were considered for inclusion if they were in English, were RCTs comparing PCI with drug-eluting or bare-metal stents and CABG for the treatment of coronary artery disease, and reported mortality and/or cause-specific mortality. Trials of PCI involving angioplasty without stenting were excluded. For each included trial, the publication with the longest follow-up duration for each outcome was selected. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: For data extraction, all studies were reviewed by 2 independent investigators, and disagreements were resolved by a third investigator in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guideline. Data were pooled using fixed- and random-effects models. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcomes were all-cause and cause-specific (cardiac vs noncardiac) mortality. Subgroup analyses were performed for PCI trials using drug-eluting vs bare-metal stents and for trials involving patients with left main disease. RESULTS: Twenty-three unique trials were included involving 13 620 unique patients (6829 undergoing PCI and 6791 undergoing CABG; men, 39.9%-99.0% of study populations; mean age range, 60.0-71.0 years). The weighted mean (SD) follow-up was 5.3 (3.6) years. Compared with CABG, PCI was associated with a higher rate of all-cause (incidence rate ratio, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.05-1.29) and cardiac (incidence rate ratio, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.05-1.45) mortality but also noncardiac mortality (incidence rate ratio, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.00-1.41). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Percutaneous coronary intervention was associated with higher all-cause, cardiac, and noncardiac mortality compared with CABG at 5 years. The significantly higher noncardiac mortality associated with PCI suggests that even noncardiac deaths after PCI may be procedure related and supports the use of all-cause mortality as the end point for myocardial revascularization trials.

Prosthetic heart valves and the COVID-19 pandemic era: What should we be concerned about?  ;BACKGROUND: The disturbance in the international normalized ratio (INR) in patients receiving warfarin therapy is of concern. We aimed to evaluate coagulation features in hospitalized patients under warfarin treatment for prosthetic heart valves during the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia pandemic. METHODS: Between 20 February and 28 March 2020, 10 patients (7 males) who were under warfarin therapy for prosthetic heart valves were hospitalized after a diagnosis of COVID-19 in Tehran Heart Center, Tehran, Iran. The clinical, paraclinical, and in-hospital outcomes were described. The patients were followed for 4 weeks. RESULTS: The median age was 62 years. All the patients received antiviral treatment, either lopinavir/ritonavir or oseltamivir. The serum level of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ranged between 0.24 and 15.24 mg/dL. Alanine aminotransaminase was normal in all the patients except for two, with levels 1.6 and 4.2 times above normal values. The INR increased in all the patients. One (10%) patient died in the hospital. No bleeding, ischemic, or thrombotic events occurred during the hospital stay and within the 4-week follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Antiviral therapy in patients with COVID-19 with prosthetic heart valves might be an issue responsible for an uncontrolled INR. Liver injury may happen in a minority of patients. Bridging in these patients during the antiviral treatment might be required and because of significant INR fluctuations, it might be safer to prescribe antiviral treatment in an inpatient setting.  
Cardiac findings in pediatric patients with spinal muscular atrophy types 2 and 3.  ;"BACKGROUND: It is unclear whether the heart is affected in pediatric patients with milder forms of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Therefore, we aimed to determine the presence of any cardiac abnormalities in these patients. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of children and adolescents with SMA types 2 and 3 between July 2018 and July 2019. All patients underwent a comprehensive cardiac evaluation, including history-taking, physical examination, electrocardiography, echocardiography, measurement of cardiac biomarkers (cardiac troponin T [cTnT] and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide [NT-proBNP]), and 24-hour Holter monitoring. RESULTS: In total, 42 patients were enrolled (27 and 15 with SMA type 2 and 3, respectively). No patient had structural heart disease, except for one with mitral valve prolapse. None had signs of ventricular dysfunction on echocardiography. Both cTnT and NT-proBNP levels were normal in all patients. Electrocardiography showed sinus tachycardia in seven patients (16.7%), and prolonged P-R interval in one (2.4%). Holter monitoring detected benign ventricular arrhythmias in two patients (4.8%), and rare supraventricular premature beats in one. The mean 24-hour heart rate was elevated in six patients (14.3%), whereas both the minimum 24-hour heart rate and the maximum R-R interval were increased in 23 (54.8%). DISCUSSION: The prevalence of cardiac disease in pediatric patients with SMA types 2 and 3 is low; however, these patients may have increased resting heart rates. A complete cardiac history and physical examination are a useful screen. Additional cardiac investigations may be performed as needed.  "
Perforation of Anterior Mitral Valve Leaflet Aneurysm: Complication of Enterococcus Faecalis Infective Endocarditis.  ;Infective endocarditis (IE) is a potentially fatal disease if untreated and transesophageal echocardiogram should be performed in all suspected cases. We report a complicated case of infective (Enterococcal faecalis) endocarditis in an elderly man who recently had a genitourinary procedure. He presented with decompensated congestive heart failure due to valvular insufficiency and was found to have multiple vegetations on aortic and mitral valves with aneurysm and perforation of the anterior mitral valve leaflet. He was appropriately treated with antibiotics and surgery. Echocardiography plays central role in risk stratification, evaluation, diagnosis and management.  
Gone, but not Forgotten.  ;The global health and economic impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has rocked our communities and way of life. With millions infected around the globe, and hundreds of thousands of lives lost, there has been a paradigm shift in how clinicians evaluate and care for patients in multiple different types of healthcare settings. Many patients are reluctant to seek medical attention for cardiovascular illnesses, and late presentations of acute cardiac issues are raising the morbidity and mortality for treatable cardiac conditions. In this expert opinion, the authors canvas the many challenges in the diagnosis, treatment and delivery of care to patients with congestive heart failure and acute coronary syndromes during the COVID-19 pandemic.  
Hemodynamic outcomes after undersizing ring annuloplasty and focal suture annuloplasty for surgical repair of functional tricuspid regurgitation.  ;"OBJECTIVE: Surgical annuloplasty for functional tricuspid regurgitation (FTR) is on the rise and can be performed in several ways with varied outcomes. In this study, we sought to compare the hemodynamic outcomes of tricuspid annuloplasty performed with a commercially available annuloplasty ring (tricuspid valve annuloplasty [TVA]) compared with focal suture annuloplasty (Hetzer) in an experimental FTR model. METHODS: An ex vivo FTR model was developed by inducing right ventricular dilatation by acute afterload elevation, causing severe tricuspid valve tethering and annular dilatation, leading to regurgitation. Ten porcine hearts in which FTR was induced underwent TVA with a 26-mm Edwards MC3 ring and Hetzer annuloplasty with a pledgeted suture cinching the anteroposterior and septal annulus. FTR was measured before after each repair, and tenting geometry, valve kinematics, and subvalvular geometry were measured with echocardiography. RESULTS: At baseline, none of the hearts had FTR, but upon afterload elevation an FTR volume of 17.7 ± 9.2 mL (26.38 ± 17.47% regurgitant fraction) was measured (P < .0001). TVA reduced regurgitation by 50% and Hetzer annuloplasty by 56% , respectively, but both left persistent FTR. Anteroseptal tenting area was 279.0 ± 158.9 mm2 before repair and decreased significantly to 147.2 ± 134.8 mm2 (P = .0195) with Hetzer but not with TVA. Posteroseptal tenting area was 425.1 ± 169.2 mm2 before repair and was significantly reduced by both techniques (TVA: 200.3 ± 102.9 mm2 [P = .0012]; Hetzer: 237.6 ± 127.6 mm2 [P = .0270]). CONCLUSIONS: Tricuspid annuloplasty with a ring or a focal suture can reduce FTR but not eliminate it. Annular approaches did not relieve tricuspid valve tethering and reduced leaflet mobility persisted. Either subannular repairs or judicious use of valve replacement may be necessary.  "
Fix Tricuspid Regurgitation Before It Gets Worse!  ;DOI: 10.1016/j.hlc.2020.09.002 PMID: 33040857  
Aortic Root Distortion During Balloon Angioplasty of Right Ventricular Outflow Tract Prior to Transcatheter Pulmonary Valve Implantation.  ;We describe our experience with aortic root distortion in transcatheter pulmonary valve implantation (TPVI). Aortic root distortion (AD) can be observed with balloon angioplasty of the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT), but its long-term significance is unknown. This has been a common finding in our institution, though not fully appreciated in our early experience. Retrospective review of procedural angiograms prior to TPVI and follow up imaging was performed. Between June 2012 and October 2017, 47 patients underwent catheterization to attempt TPVI. Five patients had coronary compression which precluded TPVI (one with significant AD as well). Four patients had significant AD and did not receive TPVI. Of the remaining 38 successful TPVI, 20 had adequate imaging to assess the aortic root. Four patients had severe AD, 7 had mild AD, and 9 with no AD. Severity of AI did not correlate with degree of AD. Median follow up after TPVI was 46 months (IQR 21-67). Of the 4 patients with severe AD who received TPVI, 1 has new mild AI with 78 months follow up. Of the 18 patients who received TPVI without adequate arch imaging, 2 patients have new mild AI with 86 and 75 months follow up. AD during RVOT angioplasty is a relatively common finding. In our early experience, some patients who were retrospectively identified to have severe AD received TPVI. These patients have done well, though further data is needed before considering severe AD a benign finding.

Safety and performance of a novel transventricular beating heart mitral valve repair system: 1-year outcomes.  ;OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and performance of a novel, beating heart procedure that enables echocardiographic-guided beating heart implantation of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) artificial cords on the posterior mitral leaflet of patients with degenerative mitral regurgitation. METHODS: Two prospective multicentre studies enrolled 13 (first-in-human) and 52 subjects, respectively. Patients were treated with the HARPOON beating heart mitral valve repair system. The primary (30-day) end point was successful implantation of cord(s) with mitral regurgitation reduction to ≤moderate. An independent core laboratory analysed echocardiograms. RESULTS: Of 65 patients enrolled, 62 (95%) achieved technical success, 2 patients required conversion to open surgery and 1 procedure was terminated. The primary end point was met in 59/65 (91%) patients. Among the 62 treated patients, the mean procedural time was 2.1 ± 0.5 h. Through discharge, there were no deaths, strokes or renal failure events. At 1 year, 2 of the 62 patients died (3%) and 8 (13%) others required reoperations. At 1 year, 98% of the patients with HARPOON cords were in New York Heart Association class I or II, and mitral regurgitation was none/trace in 52% (n = 27), mild in 23% (n = 12), moderate in 23% (n = 12) and severe in 2% (n = 1). Favourable cardiac remodelling outcomes at 1 year included decreased end-diastolic left ventricular volume (153 ± 41 to 119 ± 28 ml) and diameter (53 ± 5 to 47 ± 6 mm), and the mean transmitral gradient was 1.4 ± 0.7 mmHg. CONCLUSIONS: This initial clinical experience with the HARPOON beating heart mitral valve repair system demonstrates encouraging early safety and performance. CLINICAL REGISTRATION NUMBERS: NCT02432196 and NCT02768870.  
Paravalvular Leak Assessment: Challenges in Assessing Severity and Interventional Approaches.  ;PURPOSE OF REVIEW: With increasing use of prosthetic valves to treat degenerative valvular heart disease (VHD) in an aging population, the incidence and adverse consequences of paravalvular leaks (PVL) are better recognized. The present work aims to provide a cohesive review of the available literature in order to better guide the evaluation and management of PVL. RECENT FINDINGS: Despite gains in operator experience and design innovation, significant PVL remains a significant complication that may present with congestive heart failure and/or hemolytic anemia. To date, clear consensus or guidelines on the evaluation and management of PVL remain lacking. Although the evolution of transcatheter valve therapies has had a tremendous impact on the management of patients with VHD, the limitations and complications of such techniques, including PVL, present further challenges. Incidence of PVL, graded as moderate or greater, ranges from 4 to 7.4% in surgical and transcatheter valve replacements, respectively. Improved imaging modalities and the advent of novel surgical and percutaneous therapies have undoubtedly yielded a better understanding of PVL including its anatomical location, mechanism, severity, and treatment options. Echocardiography, used in conjunction with cardiac computed tomography and cardiac magnetic resonance, provides essential details for diagnosis and management of PVL. Transcatheter intervention has become a favored approach in lieu of surgical intervention in select patients after previous surgical or percutaneous valve replacement. PVL treatment with vascular plugs, balloon post-dilation, and the valve-in-valve methods have shown technical success with promising clinical outcomes in appropriately selected patients.  
A novel technique to manage transcatheter aortic valve embolization.  ;We report a case of a 69-year-old male who was planned for a transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) with a 26 mm Sapien 3 Valve (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, California) for the treatment of symptomatic severe aortic stenosis. During rapid ventricular pacing and implantation of the TAVR valve, there was a loss of pacing capture and subsequent embolization of the valve into the aortic arch. Retrieval of the embolized valve was attempted unsuccessfully using several techniques. Finally, by using a 34 mm Evolut R Valve (Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minnesota), we were able to secure the embolized valve in the transverse segment of the aortic arch without compromising the branch vessels. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of using a valve-in-valve approach to fixate an embolized valve in the transverse aorta.  
Ebstein's Anomaly of the Tricuspid Valve: an Overview of Pathology and Management.  ;PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Ebstein's anomaly (EA) is a rare, but complex form of congenital heart disease consisting of a right ventricular myopathy and morphologic tricuspid valve disease leading to a high incidence of right ventricular dysfunction and arrhythmias. This review offers an updated overview of the current understanding and management of patients with EA with a focus on the adult population. RECENT FINDINGS: Increased understanding of anatomic accessory atrioventricular pathways in EA has resulted in an improvement in ablation techniques and long-term freedom of atrial arrhythmia recurrence. Despite an improvement in understanding and recognition of EA, significant disease heterogeneity and complex treatment options continue to challenge providers, with the best outcomes achieved at expert congenital heart disease centers.  
The Future of Paediatric Heart Interventions: Where Will We Be in 2030?  ;PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Cardiac catheterization therapies to treat or palliate infants, children and adults with congenital heart disease have developed rapidly worldwide in both technical innovation and device development in the previous three decades. By reviewing of current status of novel or development of devices and techniques, we will discuss what is likely to happen in paediatric heart intervention in the next decade. RECENT FINDINGS: Recently, biodegradable stents and devices, transcatheter pulmonary valve implantation for the native right ventricle outflow tract and MRI-guided interventions have been progressing rapidly with good immediate to early results. These are expected to be introduced and spread in the next decade although there are still challenges to overcome. The future of paediatric heart intervention is very promising with rapid development of technological progress.

Validation of non-contrast multiple overlapping thin-slab 4D-flow cardiac magnetic resonance imaging.  ;BACKGROUND: Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) flow quantification is typically performed using 2D phase-contrast (PC) imaging of a plane perpendicular to flow. 3D-PC imaging (4D-flow) allows offline quantification anywhere in a thick slab, but is often limited by suboptimal signal, potentially alleviated by contrast enhancement. We developed a non-contrast 4D-flow sequence, which acquires multiple overlapping thin slabs (MOTS) to minimize signal loss, and hypothesized that it could improve image quality, diagnostic accuracy, and aortic flow measurements compared to non-contrast single-slab approach. METHODS: We prospectively studied 20 patients referred for transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), who underwent CMR (GE, 3 T). 2D-PC images of the aortic valve and three 4D-flow datasets covering the heart were acquired, including single-slab, pre- and post-contrast, and non-contrast MOTS. Each 4D-flow dataset was interpreted blindly for ≥moderate valve disease and compared to TEE. Flow visualization through each valve was scored (0 to 4), and aortic-valve flow measured on each 4D-flow dataset and compared to 2D-PC reference. RESULTS: Diagnostic quality visualization was achieved with the pre- and post-contrast 4D-flow acquisitions in 25% and 100% valves, respectively (scores 0.9 ± 1.1 and 3.8 ± 0.5), and in 58% with the non-contrast MOTS (1.6 ± 1.1). Accuracy of detection of valve disease was 75%, 92% and 82%, respectively. Aortic flow measurements were possible in 53%, 95% and in 89% patients, respectively. The correlation between pre-contrast single-slab measurements and 2D-PC reference was weak (r = 0.21), but improved with both contrast enhancement (r = 0.71) and with MOTS (r = 0.67). CONCLUSIONS: Although non-contrast MOTS 4D-flow improves valve function visualization and diagnostic accuracy, a significant proportion of valves cannot be accurately assessed. However, aortic flow measurements using non-contrast MOTS is feasible and reaches similar accuracy to that of contrast-enhanced 4D-flow.  
Mid-Term Clinical Outcomes Following Percutaneous Mitral Valve Edge-to-Edge Repair.  ;"BACKGROUND: Approximately 50% of patients with severe mitral regurgitation (MR) referred for surgery have prohibitive surgical risk. MitraClip (Abbott Vascular) is an alternative therapy option in these patients. The aim of this study is to evaluate mid-term outcome in patients who underwent MitraClip implantation. METHODS: All consecutive patients with ≥2+ MR and high risk for conventional surgical therapy who underwent MitraClip implantation at our unit were included in the analysis. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality and secondary endpoint was heart failure rehospitalization. RESULTS: From October 2008 to December 2016, a total of 162 patients underwent MitraClip procedure at our unit. The mean follow-up duration was 819.8 ± 671.1 days. Acute procedural success was achieved in 141 of 162 patients (87.0%) and was not significantly different between primary and secondary MR patients (P=.09). Mortality rates were 14.4%, 28.7%, 38.7%, and 49.3% at 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, and 5 years, respectively. Rehospitalization rates for heart failure were 21.7%, 34.3%, 44.2%, and 56.6% at 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, and 5 years, respectively. At follow-up, patients exhibited significant improvement in New York Heart Association functional classification (P<.001). On multivariate analysis, baseline left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <30% (odds ratio, 6.62) and baseline MR severity (odds ratio, 3.40) were the strongest predictors of mortality. Primary MR (odds ratio, 0.20) was associated with lower risk of mortality compared with secondary MR. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of MR with MitraClip results in significant symptomatic improvement with excellent short-term results. However, 5-year mortality was 49.3%; baseline LVEF <30% and MR severity are the strongest predictors of mortality, while primary MR was a predictor for lower risk of mortality when compared with secondary MR.

Transcatheter versus surgical aortic valve replacement in patients with end stage renal disease.  ;"OBJECTIVE: To assess contemporary national trends of comorbidities, outcomes, and health care resource utilization in patients with aortic stenosis (AS) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) undergoing transcatheter and surgical aortic valve replacement (TAVR and SAVR). METHODS AND RESULTS: The National-Inpatient-Sample was used to study trends in patients with AS and ESRD undergoing TAVR and SAVR between January 2012 and December 2017. Of 12,550 patients, 5,735 underwent TAVR and 6,815 underwent SAVR. Over the years, the utilization of SAVR declined (from 82.0 to 37.7%); and increased for TAVR (from 18.0 to 62.3%; p < .001). Patients receiving TAVR were older (74.6 [9.1] vs. 66.8 years [9.1]), had a higher proportion of females (37.1 vs. 32.5%), Caucasians (68.7 vs. 60.9%) and Asian /Pacific Islanders (3.1 vs. 2.7%; p < .001 for all). The TAVR patients, despite having higher comorbidity burden (anemia, coronary artery disease, chronic pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, and peripheral vascular disease) had lower inpatient mortality and complications (ST-elevation myocardial infarction, pneumonia, pneumothorax, pulmonary embolism, cardiogenic shock, cardiac arrest, and need for mechanical ventilators and vasopressors). The median length of stay (13.9-6.5 days; p < .001) and cost of stay ($311,538.16 to $255,693.40; p < .001) reduced with TAVR; but remained unchanged with SAVR. Higher proportion of patients was discharged home after TAVR vs. SAVR. CONCLUSION: Among patients with AS and ESRD, despite providing therapy to subjects with higher comorbidity burden, TAVR was associated with lower inpatient mortality, complications, length of stay, cost of care, and higher home disposition rates when compared with SAVR.

Infective endocarditis at a tertiary care hospital in South Korea.  ;OBJECTIVE: The treatment of infective endocarditis (IE) has become more complex with the current myriad healthcare-associated factors and the regional differences in causative organisms. We aimed to investigate the overall trends, microbiological features, and outcomes of IE in South Korea. METHODS: A 12-year retrospective cohort study was performed. Poisson regression was used to estimate the time trends of IE incidence and mortality rate. Risk factors for in-hospital mortality were identified with multivariable logistic regression, and model comparison was performed to evaluate the predictive performance of notable risk factors. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox regression were performed to assess long-term prognosis. RESULTS: We included 419 patients with IE, the incidence of which showed an increasing trend (relative risk 1.06, p=0.005), whereas mortality demonstrated a decreasing trend (incidence rate ratio 0.93, p=0.020). The in-hospital mortality rate was 14.6%. On multivariable logistic regression analysis, aortic valve endocarditis (OR 3.18, p=0.001), IE caused by Staphylococcus aureus (OR 2.32, p=0.026), neurological complications (OR 1.98, p=0.031), high Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (OR 1.22, p=0.023) and high Charlson Comorbidity Index (OR 1.11, p=0.019) were predictors of in-hospital mortality. Surgical intervention for IE was a protective factor against in-hospital mortality (OR 0.25, p<0.001) and was associated with improved long-term prognosis compared with medical treatment only (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of IE is increasing in South Korea. Although the mortality rate has slightly decreased, it remains high. Surgery has a protective effect with respect to both in-hospital mortality and long-term prognosis in patients with IE.  
Bioprosthesis Failure: Is Calcification the Only Problem?  ;DOI: 10.1016/j.jacc.2020.08.065 PMID: 33032736  
Association of Bioprosthetic Aortic Valve Leaflet Calcification on Hemodynamic and Clinical Outcomes.  ;"BACKGROUND: The prognostic value of aortic valve calcification (AVC) measured by using multidetector computed tomography imaging has been well validated in native aortic stenosis, and sex-specific thresholds have been proposed. However, few data are available regarding the impact of leaflet calcification on outcomes after biological aortic valve replacement (AVR). OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to analyze the association of quantitative bioprosthetic leaflet AVC with hemodynamic and clinical outcomes, as well as its possible interaction with sex. METHODS: From 2008 to 2010, a total of 204 patients were prospectively enrolled with a median of 7.0 years (interquartile range: 5.1 to 9.2 years) after biological surgical AVR. AVC measured by using the Agatston method was indexed to the cross-sectional area of aortic annulus measured by echocardiography to calculate the AVC density (AVCd). Presence of hemodynamic valve deterioration (HVD; increase in mean gradient [MG] ≥10 mm Hg and/or increase in transprosthetic regurgitation ≥1) was assessed by echocardiography in 137 patients at the 3-year follow-up. The primary clinical endpoint was mortality or aortic valve re-intervention. RESULTS: There was no significant sex-related difference in the relationship between bioprosthetic AVCd and the progression of MG. Baseline AVCd showed an independent association with HVD at 3 years. During follow-up, there were 134 (65.7%) deaths (n = 100) or valve re-interventions (n = 47). AVCd ≥58 AU/cm2 was independently associated with an increased risk of mortality or aortic valve re-intervention (adjusted hazard ratio: 2.23; 95% confidence interval: 1.44 to 3.35; p < 0.001). The AVCd threshold combined with an MG progression threshold of 10 mm Hg amplified the stratification of patients at risk (log-rank, p < 0.001). The addition of AVCd threshold into the prediction model including traditional risk factors improved outcome prediction (net classification improvement: 0.25, p = 0.04; likelihood ratio test, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Aortic bioprosthetic leaflet calcification is strongly and independently associated with HVD and the risk of death or aortic valve re-intervention. As opposed to native aortic stenosis, there is no sex-related differences in the relationship between AVCd and hemodynamic or clinical outcomes.  "
"Double outlet right atrium-A ""bridge"" across the bridging leaflets.  ";"INTRODUCTION: Mal-alignment between the inter-atrial septum (IAS) and the inter-ventricular septum (IVS) during cardiac embryogenesis results in abnormal atrioventricular (AV) connections ranging from doubleoulet left atrium (DOLA) to double outlet right atrium (DORA)1. CASE REPORT: We report DORA resulting from partial override of the interatrial septum (IAS) across the cleft between the bridging leaflets of the left atrioventricular (AV) valve. RESULTS: Successful surgical management with preservation of the orifice is described, leading to an unusual type of double orifice left AV valve. DISCUSSION: The mal-alignment of the interatrial septum, resulting in it bridging the bridging leaflets, leads to an additional orifice between the RA and the LV and a unique form of right to left shunt. DORA can cause cyanosis depending on the size of the shunt and the compliance of the ventricles. Our patient was acyanotic, possibly due to the small size of the orifice and low LV compliance secondary to hypertrophy of the LV. CONCLUSION: our case adds to the spectrum of atrial septal mal-alignment variant of DORA in the setting of AVSD without atrial and ventricular components, with RA to LV communication occurring via the smaller orifice of a left atrioventricular valve divided by the abnormal insertion of a partially overriding, mal-aligned atrial septum; a mechanism not described previously - the 'bridge' across the bridging leaflets!

Patient-specific in vitro testing for evaluating TAVR clinical performance- a complementary approach to current ISO standard testing.  ;Following in vitro tests established for surgical prosthetic heart valves, transcatheter aortic valves (TAV) are similarly tested in idealized geometries- excluding effects that may hamper TAVR performance in situ. Testing in vitro in pulse duplicator systems that incorporated patient specific replicas would enhance the testing veracity by bringing it closer to the clinical scenario. To that end we compare TAV hemodynamic performance tested in idealized geometries according to the ISO standard (baseline performance) to that obtained by testing the TAVs following deployment in patient-specific replicas. Balloon-expandable (n=2) and self-expandable (n=3) TAVs were tested in an idealized geometry in mock-circulation system (following ISO 5840-3 guidelines) and compared to measurements in a dedicated mock-circulation system adapted for the five patient-specific replicas. Patient-specific deployments resulted in a decline in performance as compared to the baseline idealized testing, as well as a variation in performance that depended on the design features of each device that was further correlated with the radial expansion and eccentricity of the deployed TAV stent (obtained with CT-scans of the deployed valves). By excluding deployment effects in irregular geometries, the current idealized ISO testing is limited to characterize baseline device performance. Utilizing patient-specific anatomic contours provides performance indicators under more stringent conditions likely encountered in vivo. It has the potential to enhance testing and development complementary to the ISO standard, for improved TAV safety and effectiveness.  
Prosthetic valve endocarditis by Trichosporon mucoides: A case report and review of literature.  ;NATIONALE: Trichosporon species are widely distributed in nature and are emerging opportunistic human pathogens. Trichosporon infections are associated with superficial cutaneous involvement in immunocompetent individuals to severe systemic disease in immunocompromised patients. Until now, there is no report in infective endocarditis by Trichosporon mucoides confirmed by molecular diagnostics PATIENT CONCERNS:: A 66-year-old man presented with a fever that had occurred for a period of 6 months. He had undergone aortic valve replacement 10 years prior. Transthoracic echocardiography showed vegetations on the prosthetic aortic valve and native mitral valve. T mucoides was detected in the cultures of blood and vegetations. DIAGNOSIS: DNA sequencing using D/D2 region of rRNA and internal transcribed spacer were performed. INTERVENTIONS: Infections were successfully controlled with valve replacement and voriconazole plus liposomal amphotericin B therapy. OUTCOMES: There has been no sign of recurrence for 18-months after treatment completion. LESSONS: This is the first reported case of infective endocarditis due to T mucoides. Clinicians should consider Trichosporon species as causative agents of endocarditis in patients who have undergone cardiac surgery.  
The Prognosis of Elderly Patients with Aortic Stenosis after Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.  ;Objective Aortic stenosis (AS) is common among elderly patients. Since transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a less invasive procedure than surgical aortic valve replacement for symptomatic severe AS, super-elderly patients have tended to undergo TAVR. We retrospectively investigated the post-TAVR outcome in super-elderly patients with severe AS. Methods This analysis included 433 patients who underwent TAVR in the University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics from 2012 to 2017. Post-TAVR mortality, complications in-hospital, rehospitalization, the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class and echocardiographic parameters were compared between patients <85 years old (n = 290) and ≥85 years old (n = 143). Results The patients ≥85 years old less frequently had a history of coronary artery disease (73.1% vs. 62.2%, p=0.026) and hypertension (87.2% vs. 77.6%, p=0.012) than younger patients. Furthermore, the patients ≥85 years old had moderate-severe mitral regurgitation more frequently (19.3% vs. 28.7%, p=0.037) at baseline than younger patients. There was no significant difference in in-hospital outcomes between the age groups. The 30-day mortality was worse in patients ≥85 years old than in younger ones (0.7% vs. 3.5%, p=0.042). While there was no significant difference in the long-term mortality between the 2 groups, the estimated 1-year mortality from Kaplan-Meier curves were 9.6% in patients <85 years old and 14.9% in patients ≥85 years old. The rate of in-hospital complications, rehospitalization rate, improvement in the NYHA functional class and echocardiographic parameters were comparable between the two groups. Conclusion The outcomes of super-elderly patients after TAVR were acceptable, suggesting that these patients could benefit from TAVR.  
Prevalence of pulmonary hypertension in adults after atrial switch and role of ventricular filling pressures.  ;"OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of elevated systemic right ventricular (sRV) end-diastolic pressure and pulmonary arterial hypertension in adults with transposition of the great arteries (TGA) who have undergone atrial switch operation. METHODS: Forty-two adults (aged ≥18 years) with complete TGA and atrial switch palliation undergoing cardiac catheterisation between 2004 and 2018 at Mayo Clinic, MN, were identified. Clinical, echocardiographic and invasive haemodynamic data were abstracted from the medical charts and procedure logs. RESULTS: Mean age was 37.6±7.9 years; 28 were male (67%). The Mustard operation was performed in 91% of individuals. Mean estimated sRV ejection fraction by echocardiography was 33.3%±10.9% and ≥moderate tricuspid (systemic atrioventricular valve) regurgitation was present in 15 patients (36%). Mean sRV end-diastolic pressure was 13.2±5.4 mm Hg. An sRV end-diastolic pressure >15 mm Hg was present in 35% of individuals whereas a pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP) >15 mm Hg was seen in 59%. Mean pulmonary artery pressure ≥25 mm Hg was seen in 47.5% of patients with PAWP being >15 mm Hg in all but one patient. CONCLUSION: In adults after atrial switch, elevated sRV end-diastolic pressure was present in only one-third of patients whereas increased PAWP was seen in almost 60%. These findings are most likely related to a combination of decreased pulmonary atrial (functional left atrium) compliance and, in a subset of patients, pulmonary venous baffle obstruction. Elevation in pulmonary pressures was highly prevalent with concomitant elevation in PAWP being present in essentially all patients.  "
Secondary Mitral Regurgitation.  ;DOI: 10.1056/NEJMcp1903331 PMID: 33027570 [Indexed for MEDLINE]  
[Isolated left ventricular hypertrophy : is it a Fabry disease?].  ;Fabry disease, an X-linked disease, results from a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme alpha-galactosidase A, which causes glycosphingolipids accumulation in the body. On the basis of the residual enzymatic activity level, a classical, severe multisystemic form and an attenuated cardiac variant form are distinguished. In all cases, patients can develop hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in adulthood, the severity of which is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality of the disease. The cardiomyopathy is usually isolated in the cardiac variant form, the most common form of the disease, and should be suspected in the presence of relatively specific ECG, echocardiographic and MRI characteristics.

Anatomy Versus Physiology-Guided Ablation for Persistent Atrial Fibrillation.  ;BACKGROUND: Pulmonary vein isolation remains the cornerstone of atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation. However, due to high recurrence rates, especially in patients with persistent AF, PV antral isolation, complemented by linear ablation, autonomic modulation, and ablation of complex fractionated electrograms, have been attempted to increase the odds of success. However, the optimum approach for a complementary strategy in addition to PVI for persistent AF is unknown. METHODS: We performed a prospective randomized trial by assigning 92 patients with persistent AF in 1:1 ratio to pulmonary-vein isolation plus ablation of electrograms showing complex fractionated activity (45 patients), or pulmonary-vein isolation plus additional linear ablation across the left atrial roof and mitral valve isthmus (47 patients). The duration of follow-up was five years. The primary endpoint was freedom from any documented recurrence of atrial fibrillation after a single ablation procedure. RESULTS: At a 12-month follow-up, 9 (23%) patients had AF recurrence in the linear ablation and 8 (21%) patients in the CFAE groups. At a mean follow-up duration of 59±36 months, 48.3% of patients in the linear ablation group and 44.6% of patients in the CFAE group were free from AF (p=0.403). There were no significant differences between the two groups for independent predictors of freedom from AF. The overall procedure time and radiation exposure were higher in the PVI+linear ablation group. There were five adverse events noted, two in the linear group (pericardial effusion not requiring drain) and 3 in the CFAE group (1 pseudoaneurysm, one effusion requiring pericardiocentesis and one effusion nor requiring drain). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with persistent atrial fibrillation, we found no difference in maintenance of sinus rhythm in either linear ablation or ablation of complex fractionated electrograms was performed in addition to pulmonary vein isolation in short- and long-term follow-up.  
Temporal trend and associated risk factors for new-onset atrial fibrillation following cardiac valve surgery.  ;AIMS: Post cardiac surgery atrial fibrillation (POAF) is common, with adverse implications. However, relatively little is known regarding the time varying nature of risk factors associated with POAF. We describe variation in POAF along with its associated risk factors. METHODS: Medical records of adult patients undergoing cardiac valve surgery from 2003-13, without a history of pre-operative AF were analyzed retrospectively. POAF was adjudicated using inpatient and outpatient electrocardiograms (EKG). Risk of AF over time along with time-varying risk factors were estimated using multiphase non-linear logistic mixed effects model. RESULTS: 10,461 patients with 100,149 EKGs were analyzed [median follow-up 4 months (IQR 48 hours-2 years)]. AF prevalence changed with time since surgery and two distinct phases were identified. Prevalence peaked to 13% at 2 weeks (early phase) and 9% near 7 years post-operatively (late phase). Older age, greater severity of preoperative tricuspid valve (TV) regurgitation, mitral valve replacement and prior cardiac surgery were time-independent risk factors for POAF. TV repair was associated with a decreased risk of early phase POAF. Pre-operative blood urea nitrogen, peripheral vascular disease and hypertension were associated with a higher risk of late phase POAF. CONCLUSIONS: POAF risk shows two distinct phases with an early peak and a late gradual rise, each associated with a different set of risk factors.  
Tricuspid valve in valve procedure with an Edwards S3 valve(©) in a 10 kg child.  ;A 4-year-old child of 10 kg weight, with four previous sternotomies, presented a severe right heart failure, due to a severe regurgitation of his bioprosthetic tricuspid valve. A percutaneous tricuspid valve in valve procedure with an Edwards S3 valve was offered for compassionate use, and performed, with no complications, and significant clinical condition improvement.  
Ectopic bone formation and systemic bone loss in a transmembrane TNF-driven model of human spondyloarthritis.  ;BACKGROUND: The transmembrane-TNF transgenic mouse, TgA86, has been shown to develop spontaneously peripheral arthritis with signs of axial involvement. To assess similarity to human spondyloarthritis, we performed detailed characterization of the axial, peripheral, and comorbid pathologies of this model. METHODS: TgA86 bone pathologies were assessed at different ages using CT imaging of the spine, tail vertebrae, and hind limbs and characterized in detail by histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis. Cardiac function was examined by echocardiography and electrocardiography and bone structural parameters by μCT analysis. The response of TgA86 mice to either early or late anti-TNF treatment was evaluated clinically, histopathologically, and by μCT analysis. RESULTS: TgA86 mice developed with 100% penetrance spontaneous axial and peripheral pathology which progressed with time and manifested as reduced body weight and body length, kyphosis, tail bendings, as well as swollen and distorted hind joints. Whole-body CT analysis at advanced ages revealed bone erosions of sacral and caudal vertebrae as well as of sacroiliac joints and hind limbs and, also, new ectopic bone formation and eventually vertebral fusion. The pathology of these mice highly resembled that of SpA patients, as it evolved through an early inflammatory phase, evident as enthesitis and synovitis in the affected joints, characterized by mesenchymal cell accumulation, and neutrophilic infiltration. Subsequently, regression of inflammation was accompanied by ectopic bone formation, leading to ankylosis. In addition, both systemic bone loss and comorbid heart valve pathology were evident. Importantly, early anti-TNF treatment, similar to clinical treatment protocols, significantly reduced the inflammatory phase of both the axial and peripheral pathology of TgA86 mice. CONCLUSIONS: The TgA86 mice develop a spontaneous peripheral and axial biphasic pathology accompanied by comorbid heart valvular dysfunction and osteoporosis, overall reproducing the progression of pathognomonic features of human spondyloarthritis. Therefore, the TgA86 mouse represents a valuable model for deciphering the role of transmembrane TNF in the pathogenic mechanisms of spondyloarthritis and for assessing the efficacy of human therapeutics targeting different phases of the disease.  
Fibrous skeleton reconstruction for invasive aortic and mitral valve endocarditis.  ;Invasive endocarditis of the aortic and mitral valves with involvement of the intervalvular fibrosa is a particular surgical challenge.

Mitigating cardiac dysfunction by TOE-guided cardioplegia and mitral valve repair.  ;Based on current guidelines, 15% to 20% of patients undergoing mitral valve repair for regurgitation develop left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction < 50%-55%) despite a normal baseline. Two schools of thought have been debated: preexisting myocardial disease or suboptimal intraoperative myocardial protection. In our view, they could be reconciled. It is well recognized that left ventricular ejection fraction with a standard cut off at 50%-55% has limited sensitivity in detecting early systolic impairment in mitral regurgitation patients. Mitral regurgitation also leads to mitochondrial oxidative stress, thus rendering the myocardium more susceptible to ischemia-reperfusion injury and precipitating postoperative cardiac dysfunction. The fall in left ventricular ejection fraction early after mitral valve repair was shown to be caused by the reduction in both myocardial contractility and left ventricular stroke volume. To mitigate the risk to myocardial reperfusion injury, appropriate cardioplegia volume and distribution and well-defined surgical repair processes are equally important. We use transesophageal echocardiography-guided cardioplegia delivery, imaging the intramyocardial flow and ensuring adequate protection of the subendocardium during mitral valve repair. Mild aortic regurgitation on a beating heart often leads to left ventricular dilatation with diminished cardioplegia flow in the myocardium, thus requiring direct ostia cardioplegia. Systematic transesophageal echocardiography assessment before surgery is essential for establishing the mitral regurgitation mechanisms and translating them into precise surgical repair strategies. The benefits of transesophageal echocardiography-guided cardioplegia delivery warrant further clinical trials in order to evolve into part of a high surgical standard.  
MicroRNAs: roles in cardiovascular development and disease.  ;"Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) comprise a group of disorders ranging from peripheral artery, coronary artery, cardiac valve, cardiac muscle, and congenital heart diseases to arrhythmias and ultimately, heart failure. For all the advances in therapeutics, CVDs are still the leading cause of mortality the world over, hence the significance of a thorough understanding of CVDs at the molecular level. Disparities in the expressions of genes and microRNAs (miRNAs) play a crucial role in the determination of the fate of cellular pathways, which ultimately affect an organism's physiology. Indeed, miRNAs serve as the regulators of gene expressions in that they perform key functions both in several important cellular pathways and in the regulation of the onset of various diseases such as CVDs. Many miRNAs are expressed in embryonic, postnatal, and adult hearts; their aberrant expression or genetic deletion is associated with abnormal cardiac cell differentiation, disruption in heart development, and cardiac dysfunction. A substantial body of evidence implicates miRNAs in CVD development and suggests them as diagnostic biomarkers and intriguing therapeutic tools. The present review provides an overview of the history, biogenesis, and processing of miRNAs, as well as their function in the development, remodeling, and diseases of the heart.  "
Longitudinal course of depressive, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms after heart surgery: a meta-analysis of 94 studies.  ;"OBJECTIVE: To analyze the longitudinal course of depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in cardiac patients following heart surgery (HS). METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and random-effects meta-analysis of cohort studies on patients undergoing HS, measuring anxiety, depressive, and PTSD symptoms before and at least 30 days after. Subgroup and meta-regression analyses, investigation of publication bias, and quality assessment were undertaken. RESULTS: We included 94 studies relating to 15,561 patients. HS included coronary artery bypass graft surgery, valve replacement, implantable cardioverter defibrillator placement, left ventricular assist device placement, heart transplantation, and other types of HS. Across studies, symptoms of depression (g=0.32; 95%CI=0.25,0.39; p<0.001) and anxiety improved after HS (g=0.52; 95%CI=0.43,0.62; p<0.001), while PTSD symptoms worsened (g=-0.42; 95%CI=-0.80,-0.04; p=0.032). The reduction of depression and anxiety levels was more pronounced for patients with underlying coronary artery disease and heart failure, and persisted over one year after HS, whereas the increase in PTSD symptoms returned to baseline after 6 months. Depression improvement was inversely associated with older age, diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidemia, and positively with baseline heart failure. No additional clinical or demographic variables were associated with the course of anxiety symptoms. Quality of included studies was low overall. Publication bias was non-significant. CONCLUSIONS: Depressive and anxiety symptoms improve over one-year after HS, while PTSD symptoms might worsen. Older patients, those with metabolic comorbidities, valve disease or ventricular arrhythmias are at higher risk for continued depressive and anxiety symptoms and should be monitored closely.  "

Rapid right ventricular pacing for balloon aortic valvuloplasty: expanding its routine use in neonates and infants.  ;OBJECTIVE: Rapid right ventricular pacing during balloon aortic valvuloplasty is commonly used to achieve balloon stability in children and adults. There is no consensus for the use of the technique in neonates and infants. We sought to review our institutional experience with rapid right ventricular pacing-assisted balloon aortic valvuloplasty across all age groups and evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the technique in the sub-group of neonates and infants <12months. METHODS: Retrospective study between February, 2011 and February, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 37 patients (Group I: 21 neonates/infants <12months and Group II: 16 children 12 months-16 years) were analysed. Catheter-measured left ventricular to aortic gradient reduced from median of 66 mmHg (with a range from 30 to 125 mmHg) to 14 mmHg (with a range from 5 to 44 mmHg) in Group I and 44 mmHg (with a range from 28 to 93 mmHg) to 18 mmHg (with a range from 2 to 65 mmHg) in Group II (p < 0.001). Procedure and fluoroscopy times were identical in the two groups. Balloon:annulus ratio was 0.94 and 0.88 in Groups I and II, respectively. Freedom from reintervention was 100% for Group I at a median time of 3.2 years and 81% at 2.7 years for Group II. Reinterventions in Group II (3/16 pts) were performed predominantly for complex left ventricular outflow tract stenosis. At follow-up echocardiogram, 45% of patients in Group I had no aortic regurgitation, 30% trace-mild, 20% mild-moderate, and 5% moderate aortic regurgitation, whereas in Group II, 50% of patients had no aortic regurgitation, 32% had mild aortic regurgitation, and 18% mild-moderate aortic regurgitation. Unicuspid valves were only encountered in Group 1 (2/21 pts, 10%) and they were predictive of mild-aortic regurgitation during follow-up (p = 0.003). Ventricular fibrillation occurred in three neonates with suspicion of myocardial ischemia on the pre-procedure echocardiogram. All were successfully defibrillated. CONCLUSIONS: Rapid right ventricular pacing can be expanded in neonates and infants to potentially decrease the incidence of aortic regurgitation and reintervention rates, hence avoiding high-risk surgical bail-out procedures for severe aortic regurgitation in the first year of life. Myocardial ischemia may predispose to ventricular dysrhythmias during rapid right ventricular pacing.  
Coronary risk of patients with valvular heart disease: prospective validation of CT-Valve Score.  ;OBJECTIVE: To prospectively validate the CT-Valve score, a new risk score designed to identify patients with valvular heart disease at a low risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) who could benefit from multislice CT (MSCT) first instead of coronary angiography (CAG). METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study of patients referred for valve surgery in the Capital Region of Denmark and Odense University Hospital from the 1 February 2015 to the 1 February 2017. MSCT was implemented for patients with a CT-Valve score ≤7 at the referring physician's discretion. Patients with a history of CAD or chronic kidney disease were excluded. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients needing reevaluation with CAG after MSCT and risk of CAD among the patients determined to be low to intermediate risk. RESULTS: In total, 1149 patients were included. The median score was 9 (IQR 3) and 339 (30%) had a score ≤7. MSCT was used for 117 patients. Of these 29 (25%) were reevaluated and 9 (7.7%) had CAD. Of the 222 patients with a score ≤7 that did not receive an MSCT, 14 (6%) had significant CAD. The estimated total cost of evaluation among patients with a score ≤7 before implementation was €132 093 compared with €79 073 after, a 40% reduction. Similarly, estimated total radiation before and after was 608 mSv and 362 mSv, a 41% reduction. Follow-up at a median of 32 months (18-48) showed no ischaemic events for patients receiving only MSCT. CONCLUSION: The CT-Valve score is a valid method for determining risk of CAD among patients with valvular heart disease. Using a score ≤7 as a cut-off for the use of MSCT is safe and cost-effective.  
Presence of mitral stenosis is a risk factor of new development of acute decompensated heart failure early after transcatheter aortic valve implantation.  ;"AIMS: Acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) can occur early after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), but the risk factors or mechanisms associated with it have not been fully determined. This hypothesis-generating study aimed to investigate the clinical indices associated with the development of ADHF within 72 hours after TAVI and to improve procedural approaches for TAVI. METHOD AND RESULTS: In this single-centre hypothesis generating prospective observational study, we enrolled 156 consecutive patients with severe aortic stenosis who underwent TAVI between January 2016 and February 2018 at our institution. We set the primary endpoint as the new development of ADHF within 72 hours after TAVI, and clinical indices associated with it were evaluated using a multivariable logistic model. The median age of the patients was 83 (quartile range 80-86) years, 48 (30.8%) were men and the median Society of Thoracic Surgery-Predicted Risk of Mortality was 7.1 (range 5.2-10.4). Mitral stenosis (MS), defined as mean transmitral valve pressure gradient ≥5 mm Hg, was present in 15 (9.6%) patients. After TAVI, the invasive mean transaortic valve pressure gradient (mAVPG) decreased from 48 (36-66) to 7 (5-11) mm Hg, and 12 (7.7%) patients developed ADHF within 72 hours after TAVI. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that MS (adjusted OR, 14.227; 95% CI 2.654 to 86.698; p=0.002) and greater decreases in mAVPG (1.038; 1.003 to 1.080; p=0.044) were associated with ADHF. CONCLUSIONS: MS and drastic improvement of mAVPG were associated with new development of ADHF within 72 hours after TAVI.  "
Computed tomography aortic valve calcium scoring for the assessment of aortic stenosis progression.  ;"OBJECTIVE: CT quantification of aortic valve calcification (CT-AVC) is useful in the assessment of aortic stenosis severity. Our objective was to assess its ability to track aortic stenosis progression compared with echocardiography. METHODS: Subjects were recruited in two cohorts: (1) a reproducibility cohort where patients underwent repeat CT-AVC or echocardiography within 4 weeks and (2) a disease progression cohort where patients underwent annual CT-AVC and/or echocardiography. Cohen's d-statistic (d) was computed from the ratio of annualised progression and measurement repeatability and used to estimate group sizes required to detect annualised changes in CT-AVC and echocardiography. RESULTS: A total of 33 (age 71±8) and 81 participants (age 72±8) were recruited to the reproducibility and progression cohorts, respectively. Ten CT scans (16%) were excluded from the progression cohort due to non-diagnostic image quality. Scan-rescan reproducibility was excellent for CT-AVC (limits of agreement -12% to 10 %, intraclass correlation (ICC) 0.99), peak velocity (-7% to +17%; ICC 0.92) mean gradient (-25% to 27%, ICC 0.96) and dimensionless index (-11% to +15%; ICC 0.98). Repeat measurements of aortic valve area (AVA) were less reliable (-44% to +28%, ICC 0.85).CT-AVC progressed by 152 (65-375) AU/year. For echocardiography, the median annual change in peak velocity was 0.1 (0.0-0.3) m/s/year, mean gradient 2 (0-4) mm Hg/year and AVA -0.1 (-0.2-0.0) cm2/year. Cohen's d-statistic was more than double for CT-AVC (d=3.12) than each echocardiographic measure (peak velocity d=0.71 ; mean gradient d=0.66; AVA d=0.59, dimensionless index d=1.41). CONCLUSION: CT-AVC is reproducible and demonstrates larger increases over time normalised to measurement repeatability compared with echocardiographic measures.  "
Impact of atrial fibrillation on outcomes of patients treated by transcatheter mitral valve repair: A systematic review and meta-analysis.  ;BACKGROUND: Conflicting data have been reported related to the impact of atrial fibrillation (AF) on outcomes after transcatheter mitral valve repair with MitraClip (MC) implantation. In this study, we assessed the prognosis of MC-treated patients according to the presence of pre-existing AF. METHODS: Randomized and observational studies reporting outcomes of pre-existing AF or sinus rhythm in patients undergoing MC treatment were identified with an electronic search. Outcomes of interest were short-and long-term mortality, stroke, bleeding, rehospitalization, myocardial infarction (MI), cardiogenic shock, acute procedure success, the hospital stay, and the number of Clips implanted. RESULTS: Eight studies (8466 individuals) were eligible. Compared to sinus rhythm, long-term mortality, the risk of bleeding, rehospitalization, and longer hospital stay were significantly higher in AF groups, whereas similar correlations were found in the analysis of other outcomes. CONCLUSION: AF may be related with worse outcomes in patients undergoing MC implantation, including long-term mortality, major bleeding, and rehospitalization. AF should be taken into account when referring a patient for MC treatment.

Bishop MA(1), Borsody K(2).  ;Mitral valve commissurotomy is a surgical technique used in the treatment of mitral stenosis. Mitral stenosis occurs from a multitude of different etiologies but is most commonly due to rheumatic heart disease, which leads to commissural fibrosis. The commissurotomy can be performed through many approaches, including an open, closed, and even percutaneous ballooning technique. The closed technique for repair was used for several years, but this has slowly changed to open repair and, more recently, to percutaneous technique. A skilled physician should have both techniques for mitral stenosis repair in their armamentarium but, most importantly, know when to use them throughout the evolution of mitral stenosis.  
Long-Term Outcomes Stratified by Body Mass Index in Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.  ;Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is emerging as the default strategy for older patients with severe, symptomatic, and trileaflet aortic stenosis. Increased body-mass index (BMI) is associated with a protective effect in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. We assessed whether elevated BMI was associated with a similar association in TAVI. We evaluated prospectively collected data from 634 patients who underwent TAVI at 2 centers from August 2008 to April 2019. Patients were stratified as normal weight (BMI 18.5 to 24.9 kg/m2, n = 214), overweight (25 to 29.9 kg/m2, n = 234), and obese (>30 kg/m2, n = 185). Outcomes were reported according to VARC-2 criteria. Mortality was assessed using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis (median follow-up 2 years). Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to estimate cumulative mortality. Baseline differences were seen in age (85 vs 84 vs 82, p <0.001), STS-PROM score (4.3 vs 3.4 vs 3.6, p <0.001), sex (50% vs 36% vs 55% female, p <0.001), clinical frailty score (p = 0.02), diabetes (21% vs 29% vs 40%, p <0.001), and presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (13% vs 13% vs 23%, p = 0.009). On multivariable analysis there was no mortality difference between normal and obese patients (hazard ratio [HR] 0.70, confidence interval [CI] 0.46 to 1.1 p = 0.11), however overweight patients had significantly lower mortality (HR 0.56 CI 0.38 to 0.85, p = 0.006). Variables independently associated with increased mortality were increasing age, male sex, COPD, previous balloon valvuloplasty, and higher STS-PROM. In conclusion, overweight patients have lower long-term mortality when compared with normal weight and obese patients undergoing TAVI.  
Randomized, Controlled Trial Comparing Mitral Valve Repair With Leaflet Resection Versus Leaflet Preservation on Functional Mitral Stenosis: The CAMRA CardioLink-2 Study.  ;"BACKGROUND: Equipoise exists between the use of leaflet resection and preservation for surgical repair of mitral regurgitation caused by prolapse. We therefore performed a randomized, controlled trial comparing these 2 techniques, particularly in regard to functional mitral stenosis. METHODS: One hundred four patients with degenerative mitral regurgitation surgically amenable to either leaflet resection or preservation were randomized at 7 specialized cardiac surgical centers. Exclusion criteria included anterior leaflet or commissural prolapse, as well as a mixed cause for mitral valve disease. Using previous data, we determined that a sample size of 88 subjects would provide 90% power to detect a 5-mm Hg difference in mean mitral valve gradient at peak exercise, assuming an SD of 6.7 mm with a 2-sided test with α=5% and 10% patient attrition. The primary end point was the mean mitral gradient at peak exercise 12 months after repair. RESULTS: Patient age, proportion who were female, and Society of Thoracic Surgeons risk score were 63.9±10.4 years, 19%, and 1.4±2.8% for those who were assigned to leaflet resection (n=54), and 66.3±10.8 years, 16%, and 1.9±2.6% for those who underwent leaflet preservation (n=50). There were no perioperative deaths or conversions to replacement. At 12 months, moderate mitral regurgitation was observed in 3 subjects in the leaflet resection group and 2 in the leaflet preservation group. The mean transmitral gradient at 12 months during peak exercise was 9.1±5.2 mm Hg after leaflet resection and 8.3±3.3 mm Hg after leaflet preservation (P=0.43). The participants had similar resting peak (8.3±4.4 mm Hg versus 8.4±2.6 mm Hg; P=0.96) and mean resting (3.2±1.9 mm Hg versus 3.1±1.1 mm Hg; P=0.67) mitral gradients after leaflet resection and leaflet preservation, respectively. The 6-minute walking distance was 451±147 m for those in the leaflet resection versus 481±95 m for the leaflet preservation group (P=0.27). CONCLUSIONS: In this adequately powered randomized trial, repair of mitral prolapse with either leaflet resection or leaflet preservation was associated with similar transmitral gradients at peak exercise at 12 months postoperatively. These data do not support the hypothesis that a strategy of leaflet resection (versus preservation) is associated with a risk of functional mitral stenosis.

Incidence of infective endocarditis caused by viridans group streptococci in Sweden - effect of cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis in dentistry for risk individuals.  ;INTRODUCTION: In October 2012, the Swedish Medical Products Agency published new recommendations for the cessation of prophylactic antibiotics in dentistry for the prevention of infective endocarditis (IE). Previously, 2 g of amoxicillin per os would be administered 1 h before invasive dental procedures to patients with valve prosthesis, complicated heart valve disease, and to those with previous endocarditis. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the total incidence of IE caused by oral viridans group streptococci (VGS) or IE caused by staphylococci, increased in Sweden after the introduction of the new recommendations. METHODS: The incidence of IE in Sweden before and after October 2012 was calculated and compared using an interrupted time series analysis. Separate analyses were conducted for the total incidence of IE, and IE caused by VGS or Staphylococcus aureus. Cases of IE were identified using the Swedish national registry of IE, which has existed since 1995 and contains data from all Swedish hospital clinics specialising in infectious disease. All cases with hospital admission date from the 1st of Jan 2008, to the 31st of Dec 2017 were included. The incidence calculations were corrected for annual changes in population size using data from the Swedish government agency Statistics Sweden. RESULTS: The results show no statistically significant increase in the slope of the trend line of the total incidence of IE, IE caused by VGS or S. aureus in the Swedish general population after October 2012, compared to before. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that the recommended cessation of prophylactic antibiotics for the prevention of IE in dentistry has not led to an increased incidence of IE caused by oral streptococci among the Swedish population.

Pulmonary artery aneurysm as a result of group 2 pulmonary artery hypertension in a patient with significant mitral and aortic valve disease - review and case report.  ;Aneurysms are uncommon, but potentially life-threatening abnormalities of the pulmonary arteries. Aneurysm of the main pulmonary artery (MPA) defined as MPA diameter over 40 mm was reported in 1 : 14 000 autopsies. The most frequent location is the main pulmonary artery (89% of cases), whereas the maximum described diameter is 106-170 mm. Clinical manifestations are usually nonspecific or asymptomatic. Right heart failure symptoms, pulmonary regurgitation, trachea or bronchi compression or pulmonary emboli caused by enlarged MPA are the most commonly described clinical manifestations. Pulmonary artery aneurysm dissection is an uncommon complication but associated with a high mortality rate. Unfortunately, guidelines regulating the optimal time for the surgical intervention still have not been developed. We present the history of 76-year-old patient suffering from an aneurysm of the pulmonary artery (74 × 61 mm), as well as mitral and aortic valve disease, who was successfully operated on in our hospital.  
MitraClip in secondary mitral regurgitation as a bridge to heart transplantation: 1-year outcomes from the International MitraBridge Registry.  ;"BACKGROUND: Patients awaiting heart transplantation (HTx) often need bridging therapies to reduce worsening and progression of underlying disease. Limited data are available regarding the use of the MitraClip procedure in secondary mitral regurgitation for this clinical condition. METHODS: We evaluated an international, multicenter (17 centers) registry including 119 patients (median age: 58 years) with moderate-to-severe or severe secondary mitral regurgitation and advanced heart failure (HF) (median left ventricular ejection fraction: 26%) treated with MitraClip as a bridge strategy according to 1 of the following criteria: (1) patients active on HTx list (in list group) (n = 31); (2) patients suitable for HTx but awaiting clinical decision (bridge to decision group) (n = 54); or (3) patients not yet suitable for HTx because of potentially reversible relative contraindications (bridge to candidacy group) (n = 34). RESULTS: Procedural success was achieved in 87.5% of cases, and 30-day survival was 100%. At 1 year, Kaplan-Meier estimates of freedom from the composite primary end-point (death, urgent HTx or left ventricular assist device implantation, first rehospitalization for HF) was 64%. At the time of last available follow-up (median: 532 days), 15% of patients underwent elective transplant, 15.5% remained or could be included in the HTx waiting list, and 23.5% had no more indication to HTx because of clinical improvement. CONCLUSIONS: MitraClip procedure as a bridge strategy to HTx in patients with advanced HF with significant mitral regurgitation was safe, and two thirds of patients remained free from adverse events at 1 year. These findings should be considered exploratory and hypothesis-generating to guide further study for percutaneous intervention in high-risk patients with advanced HF.  "
Efficacy, safety, and long-term survival of concomitant valve replacement and bipolar radiofrequency ablation in patients aged 70 years and older: a comparative study with propensity score matching from a single-Centre.  ;"BACKGROUND: Concomitant bipolar radiofrequency ablation and valve replacement in the elderly remains controversial. In the current study, we aimed to compare the outcomes of concomitant valve replacement and bipolar radiofrequency ablation with valve replacement alone in elderly patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). METHODS: This was a retrospective study of patients aged ≥70 years who underwent valve replacement with or without bipolar radiofrequency ablation in a single-centre between January 2006 and March 2015. The early postoperative results and long-term clinical outcomes were compared after propensity score matching. RESULTS: A total of 34 pairs of patients (73.94 ± 2.64 years old; 34 in the AF with ablation group and 34 in the AF without ablation group) were enrolled in the propensity score matching analysis. There were no significant differences between the two matched groups in terms of surgical mortality (5.88% vs. 2.94%, P = 0.555) and major postoperative morbidity. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a significantly better overall survival in the AF with ablation group compared to the AF without ablation group (P = 0.009). Cumulative incidence curves showed a lower incidence of cardiovascular death in the AF with ablation group (P = 0.025, Gray's test). Patients in the AF with ablation group had a reduced incidence of stroke compared to patients in the AF with ablation group (P = 0.009, Gray's test). The freedom from AF after 5 years was 58.0% in the AF with ablation group and 3.0% in the AF without ablation group. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of bipolar radiofrequency ablation is a safe and feasible procedure, even in patients aged ≥70 years, with a better long-term survival and a reduced incidence of stroke compared to valve replacement alone. These findings suggest that bipolar radiofrequency ablation should always be considered as a concomitant procedure for elderly patients with AF who require cardiac surgery. However, a large-scale, prospective, multi-centre, randomized study should be performed in the future to fully validate our findings.  "
Clinical implications of exercise-induced regional wall motion abnormalities in significant aortic regurgitation.  ;"BACKGROUND: Significant aortic regurgitation (AR) is sometimes accompanied by regional wall motion abnormalities (RWMA) during exercise stress echocardiography. The aim of this study was to estimate the association between RWMA after exercise and in the presence of significant AR in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) or volume overload and to predict the eventual need for aortic valve replacement (AVR). METHODS AND RESULTS: We retrospectively reviewed 182 patients with significant AR who underwent exercise echocardiography. In addition, we investigated patients with AR who underwent coronary angiography (CAG) or coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) and were diagnosed with CAD. The presence of RWMA after exercise was defined as newly developed RWMA after exercise and included all changes in wall motion. Patients were divided into two groups according to the presence of RWMA after exercise: the RWMA group (n = 42) and non-RWMA group (n = 140). In the RWMA group, 31 patients (73.8%) underwent coronary artery evaluation by CAG or CCTA. Only two patients in the RWMA group were diagnosed with current CAD and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention. Patients with RWMA were older (61.6 ± 10.8 vs 52.0 ± 13.7 years, P < .001), had more severe AR (54.8% vs 32.9%), and underwent AVR more frequently (40.5% vs 14.3%, P = .001) than patients without RWMA. METs (odds ratio [OR], 0.796; P = .019), difference between rest and postexercise left ventricular end-diastolic volume (OR, 0.967; P = .001), and the difference between pre- and postexercise left ventricular end-systolic volume (OR, 1.113; P < .001) were identified as independent factors associated with RWMA after exercise according to multivariable logistic regression analysis. The majority of wall motion changes were seen in the lateral and inferior segments, and the locations of wall motion changes were relatively consistent with the direction of the AR jet. The relationship between RWMA after exercise and time to AVR was investigated by simple linear regression (hazard ratio [HR], 3.402; P < .001). After adjusting for baseline parameters of diastolic blood pressure, left ventricular end-systolic dimension (LVESD), aorta size, deceleration time, and METs, the presence of RWMA after exercise was not predictive of time to AVR (HR, 1.106; P = .81). On the other hand, without forcible entry of RWMA after exercise, LVESD (HR, 1.119; P < .001) and METs (HR, 0.828; P = .006) independently predicted the eventual need for AVR as an outcome. CONCLUSION: The degree of change in wall motion from rest to exercise in those with significant AR was not correlated with CAD, but was correlated with the severity of volume overload and exercise-induced preload changes, as well as the direction of the AR jet. In addition, RWMA after exercise had no role in predicting the need for AVR.  "
[Anesthesiological implications of minimally invasive valve interventions : Transcatheter aortic valve implantation, clip reconstruction on the mitral and tricuspid valve].  ;"Catheter-guided interventional implantation of cardiac valves is one of the main developments in cardiology over the past 15 years. It is characterized by a close interdisciplinary cooperation in the heart team (H-team), which consists of cardiac anesthesiologists, cardiologists and heart surgeons. This co-responsibility for anesthesia, which is demanded by the legislator (Federal Joint Committee, G‑BA, July 2015), includes not only qualified training for the cardiac anesthesiologist, including transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) but also several years of experience in cardiac anesthesia and correlates with the recommendations of the German Society for Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine. In accompaniment with the demographic development, the number of heart valve diseases increases with age. More than 50% of all heart operations are performed on patients over the age of 70 years and nearly 20% on patients over the age of 80 years. Minimally invasive procedures are outstanding opportunities for patients who were initially classified as inoperable. Therefore, anesthesiologists must have precise knowledge of the possible complications related to the procedure itself. Additionally, it challenges the anesthesiologist with unconventional situations in the care of older patients who are exposed to a higher risk. The aforementioned risks are organic functional restrictions, increasing number of comorbidities and more severe exposure due to malnutrition and frailty; however, monitoring methods are also being developed aiming for patient-specific anesthesia management and analgesia treatment. This article discusses the interventional procedures of heart valvular diseases as well as the hemodynamic changes associated with the procedures from the anesthesiologist's point of view. To present examples, we have selected transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and the interventional procedure of mitral and tricuspid valve insufficiency called MitraClip and TricaClip. A thorough examination of the procedural risk rate shows that despite minimizing the surgical intervention by miniaturizing the devices, the presence of an experienced cardiac anesthesiologist is obligatory.

Necessity of Antiaggregation and Anticoagulation and Its Prognostic Impact: A Cardiologist's View.  ;BACKGROUND: In modern cardiology, anticoagulation and antiaggregation are key components of current treatment strategies. However, in patients treated with anticoagulation and antiplatelet substances, bleeding is a major risk. FINDINGS: In all major cardiovascular diseases, a multitude of studies have shown a positive impact of antithrombotic treatment on cardiovascular death. In patients with higher bleeding risks, recent studies showed the safety of reducing the period of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), i.e., after percutaneous coronary intervention. In patients with coronary artery disease and atrial fibrillation (AF), triple therapy including DAPT and anticoagulation is associated with very high bleeding risks. However, recently published data showed the safety of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) and P2Y12 inhibitors only compared to vitamin K antagonist (VKA) and DAPT. Anticoagulation in nonvalvular AF reduces major cerebrovascular ischemic events. However, the inherent cerebrovascular bleeding risk is an important concern of this treatment. With the advent of DOACs, this risk could be reduced compared to VKA. Furthermore, anticoagulation and antiaggregation are crucial after treatment of valve disease, both after surgical and interventional procedures. Even in heart failure, new data show benefits using antithrombotic substances. CONCLUSIONS: Anticoagulation and antiaggregation are of major prognostic relevance in cardiovascular diseases. However, the inherent bleeding risk has to be considered.  
Infolding of Self-Expandable Transcatheter Heart Valve: Case Report and Review of Literature.  ;Transcutaneous aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has become a widely accepted minimally invasive approach for treatment of severe aortic stenosis. Self-expandable prostheses are commonly the device of choice, with excellent procedural success and durability. However, there have been several recent case reports of infolding of the self-expandable prosthesis during development with subsequent malfunction and need for further intervention. We present a case of self-expandable valve prosthesis infolding managed by balloon postdilation, and summarize the cases reported in the literature to date in an attempt to increase awareness of this serious technical problem and the factors associated with it.  
Anemia Among Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Mitral Valve Repair: From the National Inpatient Sample in the United States.  ;"Background The prevalence and impact of anemia on the outcomes of transcatheter mitral valve repair (TMVr) have not been well-studied. Anemia is a commonly encountered comorbidity among patients with cardiovascular disorders and is frequently under-recognized. The study aimed to analyze the prevalence of anemia and its impact on post-TMVr in-hospital outcomes. Methods The National Inpatient Sample (NIS) was queried to identify all patients who underwent TMVr from 2011-2015 in the United States by utilizing suitable International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes. The baseline characteristics and in-hospital outcomes were compared among patients with and without anemia. Results A total of 4,382 patients were identified. Out of these, 978 (22.3%) patients had baseline anemia. Anemic patients were noted to have a higher burden of co-morbidities, including chronic kidney disease, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. The in-hospital mortality was higher but not statistically significant between anemic and non-anemic patients (3.6% vs 2.6%; odds ratio (OR): 1.44; confidence interval (CI): 0.85-2.46, p=0.179). The other adverse outcomes, including the length of stay, the requirement for blood transfusions, the incidence of post-implant acute kidney injury, hemodialysis, and the cost of hospitalization, were higher in anemic patients. Conclusion Anemia was present in one out of five patients undergoing TMVr in this nationally representative cohort. Baseline anemia showed numerically higher but not statistically significant in-hospital mortality and was associated with other in-hospital adverse outcomes. Further larger studies are needed to highlight the importance of anemia in the TMVr procedure.  "
Parameters associated with ventricular arrhythmias in mitral valve prolapse with significant regurgitation.  ;"OBJECTIVE: Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) has been associated with ventricular arrhythmias (VA), but little is known about VA in patients with significant primary mitral regurgitation (MR). Our aim was to describe the prevalence of symptomatic VA in patients with MVP (fibro-elastic deficiency or Barlow's disease) referred for mitral valve (MV) surgery because of moderate-to-severe MR, and to identify clinical, electrocardiographic, standard and advanced echocardiographic parameters associated with VA. METHODS: 610 consecutive patients (64±12 years, 36% female) were included. Symptomatic VA was defined as symptomatic and frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVC, Lown grade ≥2), non-sustained or sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF) without ischaemic aetiology. RESULTS: A total of 67 (11%) patients showed symptomatic VA, of which 3 (4%) had VF, 3 (4%) sustained VT, 27 (40%) non-sustained VT and 34 (51%) frequent PVCs. Patients with VA were significantly younger, more often female and showed T-wave inversions; furthermore, they showed significant MV morphofunctional abnormalities, such as mitral annular disjunction (39% vs 20%, p<0.001), and dilatation (annular diameter 37±5 mm vs 33±6 mm, p<0.001), lower global longitudinal strain (GLS 20.9±3.1% vs 22.0±3.6%, p=0.032) and prolonged mechanical dispersion (45±12 ms vs 38±14 ms, p=0.003) as compared with patients without VA. Female sex, increased MV annular diameter, lower GLS and prolonged mechanical dispersion were identified as independent associates of symptomatic VA. CONCLUSION: In patients with MVP with moderate-to-severe MR, symptomatic VA are relatively frequent and associated with significant MV annular abnormalities, subtle left ventricular function impairment and heterogeneous contraction. Assessment of these parameters might help decision-making over further diagnostic analyses and improve risk-stratification.  "
Features of carcinoid heart disease identified by cardiac computed tomography.  ;"BACKGROUND: Carcinoid heart disease (HD) is a rare form of valvular heart disease, the features of which have not been fully described by cardiac computed tomography (CT). METHODS: All patients with carcinoid HD that underwent cardiac CT, either preoperatively or for assessment of coronary arteries, between Apr-2006 and Dec-2019 at the Royal Free Hospital, UK, were reviewed. RESULTS: Of 32 patients with carcinoid HD, 29 (91%) had heart valve involvement. Abnormalities of the tricuspid and pulmonary valves were present in all patients, affecting all three leaflets in 23/26 (89%) unoperated patients for both valves. The aortic valve was affected in 4/29 (14%) patients and the mitral valve in 5/29 (17%). Left heart valves were affected in 6/29 (21%) patients. One patient (1/29; 3%) had all four valves affected. Severe changes with significant valvular regurgitation were seen in ≥75% of patients with tricuspid, pulmonary, and aortic valve abnormalities. Three patients had carcinoid myocardial metastases (3/32; 9%) and one patient had constrictive pericarditis (1/32; 3%). Ten patients had surgery of whom four (40%) had invasive coronary angiography preoperatively. Ten patients had a patent foramen ovale. Cardiac CT allowed an accurate assessment of damage to different leaflets/cusps, particularly of the pulmonary valve, where visualization with echocardiography was often (3/8; 38%) incomplete. CONCLUSION: Cardiac CT is a powerful tool for assessment of cardiac valve abnormalities, coronary arteries and the spatial relationship of coronary arteries with myocardial metastasis in patients with carcinoid HD, and should form part of multimodal imaging of this complex pathology.

Shear Wave Elastography Using High-Frame-Rate Imaging in the Follow-Up of Heart Transplantation Recipients.  ;"OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to investigate whether propagation velocities of naturally occurring shear waves (SWs) at mitral valve closure (MVC) increase with the degree of diffuse myocardial injury (DMI) and with invasively determined LV filling pressures as a reflection of an increase in myocardial stiffness in heart transplantation (HTx) recipients. BACKGROUND: After orthotopic HTx, allografts undergo DMI that contributes to functional impairment, especially to increased passive myocardial stiffness, which is an important pathophysiological determinant of left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction. Echocardiographic SW elastography is an emerging approach for measuring myocardial stiffness in vivo. Natural SWs occur after mechanical excitation of the myocardium, for example, after MVC, and their propagation velocity is directly related to myocardial stiffness, thus providing an opportunity to assess myocardial stiffness at end-diastole. METHODS: 52 HTx recipients that underwent right heart catheterization (all) and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) (n = 23) during their annual check-up were prospectively enrolled. Echocardiographic SW elastography was performed in parasternal long axis views of the LV using an experimental scanner at 1,135 ± 270 frames per second. The degree of DMI was quantified with T1 mapping. RESULTS: SW velocity at MVC correlated best with native myocardial T1 values (r = 0.75; p < 0.0001) and was the best noninvasive parameter that correlated with pulmonary capillary wedge pressures (PCWP) (r = 0.54; p < 0.001). Standard echocardiographic parameters of LV diastolic function correlated poorly with both native T1 and PCWP values. CONCLUSIONS: End-diastolic SW propagation velocities, as measure of myocardial stiffness, showed a good correlation with CMR-defined diffuse myocardial injury and with invasively determined LV filling pressures in patients with HTx. Thus, these findings suggest that SW elastography has the potential to become a valuable noninvasive method for the assessment of diastolic myocardial properties in HTx recipients.  "
COVID-19 Pandemics: A Surprising Link to Bread Flour With Collateral Damage to a Prosthetic Heart Valve.  ;DOI: 10.1161/CIRCIMAGING.120.011395 PMID: 33003958 [Indexed for MEDLINE]  
A dedicated Y-shaped percutaneous ECMO cannula for femoral 2-in-1 vascular access during high-risk procedures.  ;High-risk transcatheter procedures requiring hemodynamic support are growing and require multiple vascular access that may be challenging in cases of peripheral artery disease or lack of radial access and exposure to a higher risk of vascular complications. We report the novel utilization of a Y-shaped arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) cannula used as a single femoral access to perform percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and aortography during high-risk transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). The utilization of this 2-in-1 ECMO cannula may simplify vascular access and reduce vascular and bleeding complications during high-risk ECMO-supported transcatheter procedures.  
Right Ventricular Outflow Tract Reconstruction with Medtronic Freestyle Valve in the Ross Procedure: A Systematic Review with Meta-Analysis.  ;"BACKGROUND: Cryopreserved pulmonary homografts (PH) are the current gold standard for right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) reconstruction in the Ross procedure. Unfortunately, their use is limited by a relatively scarce availability and high cost. Porcine stentless xenografts (SX) such as the Medtronic Freestyle® SX are increasingly being used, although it is unclear whether the hemodynamic performance and the long-term durability are satisfactory. METHODS: The present systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement. The pooled treatment effects were calculated using a weighted DerSimonian-Laird random effects model. We also evaluated the effect of time after RVOT reconstruction on valve gradients using meta-regression. RESULTS: Six studies with a total of 156 patients met the inclusion criteria. The pooled estimates for the pooled follow-up of 37 months were: 1.3% operative mortality; 94.8% overall survival; 7.5% structural valve deterioration; 5.2% reintervention; 73.3% asymptomatic; and 1.5% moderate or severe pulmonary insufficiency. Peak valve gradients were significantly correlated with time after RVOT, increasing during follow-up. Three studies compared PH with SX; one concluded that the SX is an acceptable alternative for RVOT reconstruction, whereas two concluded that this valvular substitute had inferior performance. CONCLUSIONS: The Freestyle® SX can be considered as an alternative to PH, although it might be associated with more reinterventions, higher peak valve pressure gradients, and pulmonary valve dysfunction.

Unicuspid aortic valve repair with bicuspidization in the paediatric population.  ;OBJECTIVES: Aortic stenosis or regurgitation that requires operations in children often results from unicuspid valve morphology. In all paediatric patients with this anomaly, we have performed unicuspid valve repair by bicuspidization, creating a new commissure via adding patch material. This study reviewed our experience with this procedure. METHODS: All patients with a unicuspid aortic valve who underwent bicuspidization at ≤18 years of age between 2003 and 2018 were evaluated. Autologous pericardium had initially been used for cusp augmentation. Since 2014, decellularized xenogeneic tissue or expanded polytetrafluoroethylene membrane has been applied. RESULTS: There were 60 consecutive patients. The median operative age was 13 (1-18) years. Thirty patients had prior surgical or catheter valvuloplasties. Aortic regurgitation, aortic stenosis and their combination were present in 22, 11 and 27 patients, respectively. Autologous pericardium decellularized tissue and expanded polytetrafluoroethylene were used in 45, 11 and 4 patients, respectively, without intraoperative conversion to valve replacement. The overall survival was 96% at 10 years with 2 late deaths. Twenty patients underwent aortic valve reoperation due to patch degeneration (n = 11), suture dehiscence of the patch (n = 3), subaortic stenosis (n = 3) or other reasons (n = 3). Freedom from aortic valve reoperation was 73% and 50% at 5 and 10 years, respectively. Fifteen patients (25%) required valve replacement with pulmonary autograft (n = 14) or prosthesis (n = 1) 5.2 (0.2-13) years after bicuspidization at the age of 19 (10-32) years. CONCLUSIONS: Bicuspidization is a safe and reproducible alternative to valve replacement with acceptable freedom from reoperation. It can serve as a bridge to valve replacement providing superior outcomes in adults.

Cardiac malformations in children with congenital hypothyroidism.  ;Congenital hypothyroidism (CH) is the most common endocrine disease in children, according to literature, infants with CH have an increased risk of associated congenital malformations (CM), especially cardiac defects (CD), compared to the general population. We retrospectively analyzed medical records of 255 patients with a positive screening result for CH in the period 1991-2016 followed at our Center. At the time of enrollment, the clinical examination included looking for the presence of heart murmurs and dysmorphic features. In all patients an echocardiography with cardiological evaluation were performed. Of all patients, 191 were included in the final analysis. Of these, 51.3% (98/191) presented an eutopic normally sized thyroid gland while 48.7% (93/191) showed a thyroid dysgenesis. Among the studied infants, 13.6% (26/191) presented CD. The most frequent cardiac anomaly was atrial septal defect (ASD) which was found in 65.4% (17/26) of patients with CD. Other defects were ventricular septal defect (VSD), patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), pulmonary valve stenosis (PvS), transposition of the great vessels (TGV), aortic valve stenosis (AvS). Six patients had multiple defects. In the analysed group, there was no significant relation with sex, type of CH, median blood-TSH (b-TSH) and serum-TSH (s-TSH) values and frequency of CD. There is a high prevalence of CD in CH, indicating the need of routine echocardiography in these patients to achieve an early diagnosis and management of CD.

Impact of Mitral Regurgitation on the Flow in a Model of a Left Ventricle.  ;PURPOSE: Mitral regurgitation (MR) is the second most common valve disease in industrialized countries. Despite its high prevalence, little is known about its impact on the flow dynamics in the left ventricle (LV). Because of the interdependence between valvular function and hemodynamics in the heart chambers, an exploration of the dynamics in the LV could lead to a diagnosis of MR. This in vitro study aimed to develop an advanced left heart simulator capable of reproducing several conditions of MR and to evaluate their impact on the LV flow dynamics in terms of flow structures and viscous energy dissipation (VED). METHODS: A simulator, previously developed to test mechanical and biological valves, was upgraded with an original anatomically-shaped mitral valve made from a hydrogel. The valve can be used in healthy or pathological configurations. The nature and severity of the disease was controlled by applying specific strain to the chordae. In this study, in addition to a healthy condition, two different severities of MR were investigated: moderate MR and severe MR. Planar time-resolved particle image velocimetry measurements were performed in order to evaluate the velocity field in the LV and the VED induced by each condition. RESULTS: Our results showed that MR led to flow disturbances in the LV that were characterized by an increase in mitral inflow velocity and by elevated values of VED. Interestingly VED increased in proportion to the severity of MR and with a dissipation predominating during systole. CONCLUSION: Considering these results, the introduction of new parameters based on LV VED could provide crucial information regarding the coupling between the mitral valve and the LV and allow for a better stratification of patients with MR.  
Delayed-Onset Retrobulbar Hemorrhage and Glaucoma Drainage Device Extrusion in a Patient on Anticoagulation: A Case Report.  ;Both retrobulbar hemorrhage and plate extrusion are uncommon complications after implantation of a glaucoma drainage device (GDD). There are no published reports on extrusion of an Ahmed glaucoma valve after delayed-onset retrobulbar hemorrhage in Korea. Herein, we report a case of spontaneous extrusion of a GDD after delayed-onset retrobulbar hemorrhage in a patient on anticoagulation. The case was a 72-year-old man with open-angle glaucoma and proliferative diabetic retinopathy, as well as systemic hypertension, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure due to coronary heart disease, and chronic kidney disease, who underwent combined Ahmed glaucoma valve implantation and cataract extraction surgery in his right eye. The body remained in position with control of intraocular pressure for 2 months. On day 67 (5 days post-coronary artery bypass surgery), he complained of decreased visual acuity, periorbital swelling, bloody discharge, and limited extraocular movement. One month later, the body was extruded with a scleral flap tear. Therefore, delayed-onset retrobulbar hemorrhage should be kept in mind in patients on anticoagulants after insertion of a GDD.  
Relations of Augmented Systolic Annular Expansion and Leaflet/Papillary Muscle Dynamics in Late-Systolic Mitral Valve Prolapse Evaluated by Echocardiography with a Speckle Tracking Analysis.  ;The mechanism of systolic annular expansion in mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is not clarified. Since annular expansion is systolic outward shift of MV leaflet/chorda tissue complex at superior and outer ends, annular expansion could be related to inward (superior) shift of the complex at another inferior and inner end of the papillary muscle (PM) tip and/or systolic lengthening of the tissue complex, especially MV leaflets.MV annulus systolic expansion, PMs' systolic superior shift, and MV leaflets' systolic lengthening were evaluated by echocardiography with a speckle tracking analysis in 25 normal subjects, 25 subjects with holo-systolic MVP and 20 subjects with late-systolic MVP.PMs' superior shift, MV leaflets' lengthening, MV annular area at the onset of systole and subsequent MV annulus expansion were significantly greater in late-systolic MVP than in holo-systolic MVP (4.6 ± 1.6 versus 1.5 ± 0.7 mm/m2, 2.5 ± 1.4 versus 0.6 ± 2.0 mm/m2, 6.8 ± 2.5 versus 5.7 ± 1.0 cm2/m2 and 1.6 ± 0.8 versus 0.1 ± 0.5 cm2/m2, P < 0.001, respectively). Multivariate analysis identified MV leaflets' lengthening and PMs' superior shift as independent factors associated with MV annular expansion.Conclusions: These results suggest that systolic MV annular expansion in MVP is related to abnormal MV leaflets' lengthening and PMs' superior shift.  
The Usefulness and Limitations of Impedance Cardiography for Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Device Optimization.  ;"Identifying the optimal atrioventricular (AV) or interventricular (VV) delay is beneficial for patients using cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) devices. Ultrasonic echocardiography (UCG) has been the most commonly used method; however, it requires high technical knowledge. Impedance cardiography (ICG) can calculate stroke volume by measuring changes in transthoracic electric impedance. This study sought to assess the clinical utility of ICG in comparison with that of UCG for the optimization of CRT devices.Patients who underwent CRT device implantation were retrospectively analyzed. One week after implantation, optimization of AV delay (AVD) was performed in every patient with ICG (AVD-ICG) and UCG (AVD-UCG). VV delay (VVD) was then determined according to the optimal AVD using these two methods.Forty-two patients were enrolled. Average AVD-ICG was significantly shorter than AVD-UCG (128 ± 49 versus 146 ± 41 milliseconds, P = 0.018). Five patients (12%) had the same optimized AVD with two methods, and the difference between AVD-ICG and AVD-UCG was ≤ 20 milliseconds in 19 patients (45%). In the multivariate analysis, the presence of postoperative mitral regurgitation (MR) was an independent predictor of AVD-ICG/AVD-UCG mismatch, defined as a difference over 20 milliseconds (odds ratio = 10.71; 95% confidence interval = 1.72 to 66.72; P = 0.018). The results of optimized VVD were similar using both methods.ICG might be a promising tool for the rapid optimization of CRT devices. However, in patients with moderate-to-severe MR, ICG may not be able to optimize AVD.  "
Characterization of left ventricular myocardial sodium-glucose cotransporter 1 expression in patients with end-stage heart failure.  ;"BACKGROUND: Whereas selective sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors consistently showed cardiovascular protective effects in large outcome trials independent of the presence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), the cardiovascular effects of dual SGLT1/2 inhibitors remain to be elucidated. Despite its clinical relevance, data are scarce regarding left ventricular (LV) SGLT1 expression in distinct heart failure (HF) pathologies. We aimed to characterize LV SGLT1 expression in human patients with end-stage HF, in context of the other two major glucose transporters: GLUT1 and GLUT4. METHODS: Control LV samples (Control, n = 9) were harvested from patients with preserved LV systolic function who went through mitral valve replacement. LV samples from HF patients undergoing heart transplantation (n = 71) were obtained according to the following etiological subgroups: hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM, n = 7); idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM, n = 12); ischemic heart disease without T2DM (IHD, n = 14), IHD with T2DM (IHD + T2DM, n = 11); and HF patients with cardiac resynchronization therapy (DCM:CRT, n = 9, IHD:CRT, n = 9 and IHD-T2DM:CRT, n = 9). We measured LV SGLT1, GLUT1 and GLUT4 gene expressions with qRT-PCR. The protein expression of SGLT1, and activating phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPKα) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) were quantified by western blotting. Immunohistochemical staining of SGLT1 was performed. RESULTS: Compared with controls, LV SGLT1 mRNA and protein expressions were significantly and comparably upregulated in HF patients with DCM, IHD and IHD + T2DM (all P < 0.05), but not in HCM. LV SGLT1 mRNA and protein expressions positively correlated with LVEDD and negatively correlated with EF (all P < 0.01). Whereas AMPKα phosphorylation was positively associated with SGLT1 protein expression, ERK1/2 phosphorylation showed a negative correlation (both P < 0.01). Immunohistochemical staining revealed that SGLT1 expression was predominantly confined to cardiomyocytes, and not fibrotic tissue. Overall, CRT was associated with reduction of LV SGLT1 expression, especially in patients with DCM. CONCLUSIONS: Myocardial LV SGLT1 is upregulated in patients with HF (except in those with HCM), correlates significantly with parameters of cardiac remodeling (LVEDD) and systolic function (EF), and is downregulated in DCM patients with CRT. The possible role of SGLT1 in LV remodeling needs to be elucidated.  "
Tully A(1), Chowdhury YS(2).  ;"Considering the constant stress on the four valves of the human heart, beating an average 80 times per minute for over 70 years for over 3 billion beats, on the whole, human heart valves perform amazingly well. Less than 2% of the population is estimated to suffer valvular disease.  The history of the treatment of valvular disease is marked by daring innovation and multidisciplinary collaboration; from the days of closed digital commissurotomies (sticking a surgeon’s finger through a heart valve) to homemade balls in cages to the pathophysiologic connection between treating strep throat with antibiotics and preventing rheumatic heart disease decades into the future. These historical episodes have something to teach about progress in healthcare. However, this article will focus on surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) for stenosis, insufficiency, or endocarditis using bioprosthetic valves. The interested reader is invited to peruse closely related content, especially surgical aortic valve replacement, surgical aortic valve repair, stentless pulmonary autograft/homograft aortic valve replacement (Ross procedure), minimally invasive aortic valve surgery, and transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), as well as more general treatments of aortic valve disease and prosthetic valves.

An Unusual Urological Manifestation of Williams-Beuren Syndrome: Posterior Urethral Valve.  ;Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS) is a genetic, well-defined, rare, neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by intellectual disability, congenital heart defects, abnormal facial features, and growth, endocrine, and genitourinary abnormalities. The genitourinary abnormalities in WBS frequently include congenital structural renal defects, vesicoureteral reflux, nephrocalcinosis, proteinuria, and chronic renal insufficiency. Treatment of patients with posterior urethral valve (PUV) remains a clinical challenge, requiring long-term management from early infancy into adulthood in order to avoid progressive renal insufficiency. To my knowledge, this is the first worldwide case of WBS with PUV in a 12-year-old boy. Due to the delayed detection of the defect, chronic renal disease occurred as a risk for him. This case demonstrates the importance of early diagnosis of genitourinary anomalies such as PUV to prevent chronic renal disease in boys and especially in patients with WBS.  
Cardiac Involvement by Burkitt Lymphoma in a 49-Year-Old Man.  ;Malignant metastases are among the most common cardiac masses. We report a rare case of cardiac involvement by Burkitt lymphoma in a 49-year-old man who presented with a 2-month history of dyspnea and palpitations. A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed 2 intracardiac masses in the right atrium (one of which partially encased the tricuspid valve), myocardial infiltration, and pericardial disease. Results of pleural fluid cytology and flow cytometry confirmed involvement by Burkitt lymphoma. Subsequent chemotherapy markedly reduced the intracardiac tumor burden and resolved the patient's presenting symptoms. Our case highlights the importance of cardiac imaging in diagnosing systemic illness, initiating early and appropriate treatment, and monitoring disease progression in patients with intracardiac Burkitt lymphoma.  
Surgical Endoepicardial Linear Ablation for Ventricular Tachycardia With Postinfarction Left Ventricular Aneurysm.  ;"This retrospective study evaluated the feasibility of surgical endoepicardial linear ablation for ventricular tachycardia in patients with postinfarction left ventricular aneurysm. Sixty-four patients with multivessel coronary artery disease and left ventricular aneurysm but no mural thrombosis of the aneurysm or valve disease were treated at our institution from March 2012 through July 2015. All underwent off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting and left ventricular aneurysm repair by linear plication. Twenty-three patients (35.9%) had ventricular tachycardia and underwent surgical endoepicardial linear ablation on the beating heart guided by epicardial substrate mapping with the Carto 3 system. The remaining 41 patients (64.1%) composed the no-ablation group. The effectiveness of surgical linear ablation in the ablation group was evaluated. Safety and clinical outcomes were evaluated and compared between the groups. The ventricular tachycardia recurrence rate in the ablation group was 17.4% in the immediate postoperative period and 23.8% at last follow-up (39 ± 21 mo). Early (<30-d) mortality rates were 8.7% in the ablation group and 4.9% in the no-ablation group (P=0.41); the respective late mortality rates were 19.1% and 18% (P=0.70). Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that preoperatively poor left ventricular function was an independent risk factor for early and late death in both groups. The groups were similar in terms of the need for postoperative mechanical circulatory support, intensive care unit stay, and cumulative survival rate. We conclude that, for carefully selected candidates, surgical endoepicardial linear ablation combined with off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting and left ventricular aneurysm linear plication is a feasible treatment for ventricular tachycardia with postinfarction left ventricular aneurysm.

Acute aortic dissection during pregnancy: Trials and tribulations.  ;BACKGROUND: Type A acute aortic dissection (TAAD) during pregnancy is a life-threatening event for both the mother and the unborn baby. Pregnancy has been recognized as an independent risk factor for TAAD, postulated to be due to physiological changes that cause hyperdynamic circulation. This review seeks to outline the current controversies around this unique group. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was carried out across large databases to assimilate relevant papers regarding acute aortic dissection in pregnant women. RESULTS: The presentation can be atypical in many cases and further concern from clinicians of fetal radiation exposure can result in missed or delayed diagnoses. Investigation via the quickest form of imaging, whether computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or transesophageal echocardiography, should be carried out promptly due to the high risk of mortality. Surgical management of TAAD in pregnancy revolves primarily around the decision to deliver the fetus concomitantly or to perform the aortic repair with the fetus in utero. CONCLUSIONS: Management of this group includes rapid and dynamic assessment without delay. From conception to postpartum, there are multiple stages in which to manage these women. Challenges in carrying out management in the form of operative techniques and cardiopulmonary bypass place the fetus at risk and must be approached with caution, particularly as there is little evidence-base for many of these decisions. Further research into reducing maternal and fetal mortality is necessary.  
Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia with an update on cholesterol management.  ;Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an autosomal dominant condition that increases the risk of premature cardiovascular disease. Despite advances in treatment, it remains under detected and under treated. As an inherited condition, it poses a risk to the patient and family members. Most cases are due to defective low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) activity. Heterozygous mutations are common (1:250-1:300). Homozygous FH is very rare (2-3 in a million), with higher circulating cholesterol levels and a poorer cardiovascular prognosis. We present the management of a case of homozygous hypercholesterolemia due to homozygous LDLR mutation. The patient subsequently developed severe coronary artery and aortic valve disease despite aggressive lipid-lowering therapy. We review advanced lipid management options that include lipoprotein apheresis, Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin/Kexin type 9 inhibition, and the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein inhibitor lomitapide.  
Visualisation of the tricuspid valve using a new 3D echocardiographic scoring system.  ;With rising focus on interventional treatment of the tricuspid valve (TV), the need for good echocardiographic imaging increases. Aim of this study was to develop a scoring system describing how accurate three dimensional (3D) echocardiographic imaging of TV and its anatomical structures is. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this retrospective exploratory cohort study, we analysed data from consecutive patients undergoing transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). 3D sequences were stored using eight different views. In each view, scoring focused on visualisation of five (in TOE 6) anatomical structures with a maximum of three points per structure for excellent imaging quality. We compared the scores of patients with and without relevant tricuspid regurgitation (TR) (cut-off effective regurgitant orifice 0.4 cm² measured in two-dimensional (2D) TTE using velocity time integral and proximal isovolumetric velocity area). 108 consecutive patients were examined, 40.7% presented with relevant TR. With the exception of coaptation, a higher score was achieved for all structures in TOE than in TTE. TV ring (TVR) was easiest to visualise with TOE in four-chamber view (4 CV) (2.42±0.67 points) presenting the highest score independent of anatomical structure and view. Posterior leaflet had best imaging scores in TOE in 4 CV (2.0±0.86) compared with TTE in 4 CV (1.64±0.80), p=0.001. Patients with relevant TR had significantly better 3D imaging scores in 4 CV compared with patients without relevant TR (TTE p<0.013, TOE p<0.002). CONCLUSION: 4 CV delivers the most detailed information in TTE, whereas multiple views deliver good scores in TOE. As TVR is easiest to visualise, most of the patients would be suitable for a ring-based echocardiography-guided intervention. The score enables a standardised comparison of image quality.  
Mitral valve repair versus replacement in patients with rheumatic heart disease.  ;"BACKGROUND: Rheumatic heart disease remains a major cause of cardiovascular death worldwide. Limited real-world nationwide data are available to compare the long-term outcomes between mitral valve repair and replacement in rheumatic heart disease. METHODS: We identified adult patients with rheumatic heart disease who underwent mitral valve repair or replacement surgery between 2000 and 2013 from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database. Outcomes of interest included operation-related complications, all-cause mortality, and mitral valve reoperation rate. Propensity score matching at a 1:1 ratio was conducted to mitigate possible confounding factors. RESULTS: A total of 5086 patients with rheumatic heart disease who underwent mitral valve surgery were identified. Of those, 489 (9.6%) and 4597 (90.4%) underwent mitral valve repair and mitral valve replacement, respectively. After propensity score matching was applied, each group had 467 patients. No difference in risk of in-hospital mortality was observed between groups. With a mean follow-up of 6 years, the mitral valve repair group had comparable risks of all-cause mortality with the mitral valve replacement group (33.4% vs 32.5%; hazard ratio, 1.01; 95% confidence interval, 0.81-1.25). However, higher risks of mitral valve reoperation were observed in the mitral valve repair group (subdistribution hazard ratio, 4.32; 95% confidence interval, 2.02-9.23). Previous percutaneous transvenous mitral commissurotomy was identified as a risk factor of mitral valve reoperation in the repair group. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with rheumatic heart disease, mitral valve repair is not associated with superior long-term outcomes. Patients should be carefully selected for mitral valve repair because of its higher reoperation rate, particularly those with previous percutaneous transvenous mitral commissurotomy.  "
Antiphospholipid syndrome and valvular heart disease, a complex scenario of thrombotic events, a case report.  ;"BACKGROUND: Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is a rare coagulation disorder associated with thrombotic events, myocardial infarction, and valvular heart disease. During valvular replacement surgery, the high risk of thrombosis combined with the operative risks in these specific groups of patients poses a challenge to the medical team. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case of a female patient with APS and mixed aortic valve disease. During surgery, she suddenly developed complete cardiac arrest. Three months later, after she recovered, and while she was still on close follow up, a thrombotic event caused myocardial infarction. After prompt and precise treatment, the patient successfully recovered; one year after surgery patient is doing well. CONCLUSION: Adequate surgical technique along with optimal anticoagulation strategies and long term follow up are of paramount importance to ensure an uneventful recovery. A multidisciplinary team is required to manage these complex scenarios and high-risk patients.  "
Local myocardial stiffness variations identified by high frame rate shear wave echocardiography.  ;BACKGROUND: Shear waves are generated by the closure of the heart valves. Significant differences in shear wave velocity have been found recently between normal myocardium and disease models of diffusely increased muscle stiffness. In this study we correlate in vivo myocardial shear wave imaging (SWI) with presence of scarred tissue, as model for local increase of stiffness. Stiffness variation is hypothesized to appear as velocity variation. METHODS: Ten healthy volunteers (group 1), 10 hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) patients without any cardiac intervention (group 2), and 10 HCM patients with prior septal reduction therapy (group 3) underwent high frame rate tissue Doppler echocardiography. The SW in the interventricular septum after aortic valve closure was mapped along two M-mode lines, in the inner and outer layer. RESULTS: We compared SWI to 3D echocardiography and strain imaging. In groups 1 and 2, no change in velocity was detected. In group 3, 8/10 patients showed a variation in SW velocity. All three patients having transmural scar showed a simultaneous velocity variation in both layers. Out of six patients with endocardial scar, five showed variations in the inner layer. CONCLUSION: Local variations in stiffness, with myocardial remodeling post septal reduction therapy as model, can be detected by a local variation in the propagation velocity of naturally occurring shear waves.  
Novel FHL1 mutation variant identified in a patient with nonobstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and myopathy - a case report.  ;BACKGROUND: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a genetic disorder mostly caused by sarcomeric gene mutations, but almost 10% of cases are attributed to inherited metabolic and neuromuscular disorders. First described in 2008 in an American-Italian family with scapuloperoneal myopathy, FHL1 gene encodes four-and-a-half LIM domains 1 proteins which are involved in sarcomere formation, assembly and biomechanical stress sensing both in cardiac and skeletal muscle, and its mutations are responsible for a large spectrum of neuromuscular disorders (mostly myopathies) and cardiac disease, represented by HCM, either isolated, or in conjunction with neurologic and skeletal muscle impairment. We thereby report a novel mutation variant in FHL1 structure, associated with HCM and type 6 Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD). CASE PRESENTATION: We describe the case of a 40 year old male patient, who was referred to our department for evaluation in the setting of NYHA II heart failure symptoms and was found to have HCM. The elevated muscular enzymes raised the suspicion of a neuromuscular disease. Rigid low spine and wasting of deltoidus, supraspinatus, infraspinatus and calf muscles were described by the neurological examination. Electromyography and muscle biopsy found evidence of chronic myopathy. Diagnosis work-up was completed by next-generation sequencing genetic testing which found a likely pathogenic mutation in the FHL1 gene (c.157-1G > A, hemizygous) involved in the development of X-linked EDMD type 6. CONCLUSION: This case report highlights the importance of multimodality diagnostic approach in a patient with a neuromuscular disorder and associated hypertrophic cardiomyopathy by identifying a novel mutation variant in FHL1 gene. Raising awareness of non-sarcomeric gene mutations which can lead to HCM is fundamental, because of diagnostic and clinical risk stratification challenges.  
[Clinical features of patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy combining obstructive sleep apnea].  ;Objective: To investigate the clinical features of patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) combined with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Methods: From 2010 to 2018, a total of 299 patients who were diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and underwent sleep monitoring at Fuwai Hospital were retrospectively analyzed. General clinical features, data of echocardiography, and sleep breathing parameters were recorded. OSA was diagnosed by apnea-hypopnea index ≥ 5 events/hour. Clinical characteristics were compared between patients with and without OSA. Results: A total of 156 (52.2%) HOCM patients were diagnosed with OSA. Compared with patients without OSA, patients with OSA were older((54±10) years vs (45±14) years, P<0.001), had a higher body mass index ((27±3) kg/m(2) vs (25±3) kg/m(2), P<0.001), a higher prevalence of hypertension (54.4% (85/156) vs 21.0% (30/143), P<0.001), hyperlipidemia (37.2% (58/156) vs 13.3% (19/143), P<0.001) and smoking history (48.1% (75/156) vs 35.0% (50/143), P=0.022). Patients with OSA also had a higher incidence of New York Heart Association functional class Ⅱ or Ⅲ (P=0.017), atrial fibrillation (P=0.005), and higher levels of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, fast glucose and high-sensitive c-reactive protein (all P<0.001). Left ventricular end-diastolic diameter as well as ascending aorta diameter in patients with OSA were also greater than those without OSA (both P<0.001). Apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) value positively correlated with left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (r=0.346), ascending aorta diameter (r=0.357) and high-sensitive c-reactive protein (r=0.230) (all P<0.001). Conclusions: A high prevalence of OSA occurs in patients with HOCM. Severity of OSA correlates with cardiac remodeling and serum inflammatory factor level. As for HOCM patients, clinicians should actively monitor the sleep breathing parameters in order to recognize and treat potential OSA, thereby improving the prognosis of patients with HOCM.  
Myocardial Function, Heart Failure and Arrhythmia in Marfan Syndrome: A Systematic Literature Review.  ;Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a heritable systemic connective tissue disease with important cardiovascular involvement, including aortic root dilatation and mitral valve prolapse. Life expectancy in patients with MFS is mainly determined by cardiovascular complications, among which aortic dissection or rupture are most dreaded. In recent years, heart failure and ventricular arrhythmia have drawn attention as extra-aortic cardiovascular manifestations and as additional reported causes of death. Imaging studies have provided data supporting a primary myocardial impairment in the absence of valvular disease or cardiovascular surgery, while studies using ambulatory ECG have demonstrated an increased susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmia. In this paper, current literature was reviewed in order to provide insights in characteristics, pathophysiology and evolution of myocardial function, heart failure and ventricular arrhythmia in MFS.  
Ramirez Alcantara J(1), Mendez MD(2).  ;"Congenital heart disease is an abnormal formation of the heart or blood vessels next to the heart. It has an incidence of 8 cases of every 1000 live birth worldwide. In the United States, congenital heart disease affects 1% of births (40,000) per year, of which 25% have critical Congenital heart disease. In the U.S. the congenital heart disease represents approximately 4.5% of all neonatal deaths. The survival rate of patients with congenital heart disease will depend on the severity, time of diagnosis, and treatment. Approximately 97% of babies born with a non-critical congenital heart disease have a life expectancy of one year of age, and approximately 95% are expected to live around 18 years of age. A rare type of congenital heart disease is an interrupted aortic arch (IAA), which affects approximately 1.5% of congenital heart disease patients. Interrupted aortic arch is an anomaly that can be considered the most severe form of aortic coarctation. In an IAA, there is an anatomical and luminal disruption between the ascending and descending aorta. IAA is a ductus dependent lesion since this is the only way the blood flow can travel to places distal to the disruption. There is posterior malalignment of the conal septum additional to the interrupted aortic arch, producing a ventricular septal defect as an associated lesion. This lesion is present is approximately 73% of all cases. Due to this malalignment, there could be left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Besides a ventricular septal defect, IAA can be associated with other more complicated cardiac anomalies; for example, transposition of the great arteries, truncus arteriosus, aortopulmonary window, single ventricle, aortic valve atresia, right-sided ductus, and double-outlet right ventricle.

Virtually All Complications of Active Infective Endocarditis Occurring in a Single Patient.  ;Described herein is a 49-year-old black man with advanced polycystic renal disease, on hemodialysis for 6 years, who during his last 12 days of life had his vegetations on the aortic valve extend to the mitral and tricuspid valves, through the aortic wall to produce diffuse pericarditis, to the atrioventricular node to produce complete heart block, and embolize to cerebral arteries producing multiple brain infarcts, to a branch on the left circumflex coronary artery producing acute myocardial infarction, and to mesenteric arteries producing bowel infarction.  
Is there a transcatheter solution for a sick neonate with hypoplastic right heart syndrome?: Pulmonary valve perforation in a neonate with hypoplastic right ventricle with pulmonary atresia, restrictive VSD-a case report.  ;BACKGROUND: Hypoplastic right heart syndrome with pulmonary atresia is a rare cyanotic heart disease with poor prognosis requiring urgent intervention to establish the pulmonary blood flow. Pulmonary blood flow is achieved by BT shunt or percutaneous techniques like PDA stenting or pulmonary valve perforation. Various series have shown that early surgical intervention causes high mortality in these patients. Pulmonary valve perforation is a suitable, physiological alternative to surgical techniques in selected patients. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of hypoplastic right heart syndrome with pulmonary atresia and restrictive VSD presenting with cyanosis from birth and underwent pulmonary valve perforation successfully. CONCLUSION: Duct-dependent pulmonary circulation is a pediatric emergency, palliative procedure for establishing adequate pulmonary blood flow is essential early in the life. In the management of duct-dependent pulmonary circulation, RVOT perforation is an effective and safe option in suitable high-risk subgroups. The induced pulmonary regurgitation along with established physiological antegrade flow would be beneficial in the remodeling of tripartite/hypertrophied small RV.  
Prevalence and predictors of aortic root abscess among patients with left-sided infective endocarditis: a cross-sectional comparative study.  ;BACKGROUND: Aortic root abscess (ARA) is a major complication of infective endocarditis that is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Limited data are present about patient characteristics and outcomes in this lethal disease. We aimed to study the clinical and echocardiographic characteristics of patients with ARA compared to patients with left-sided infective endocarditis without ARA. We included patients with a definite diagnosis of left-sided infective endocarditis according to modified Duke's criteria. The patients were classified into two groups according to the presence of ARA (ARA and NO-ARA groups). All the patients were studied regarding their demographic data, clinical characteristics, laboratory and imaging data, and complications. RESULTS: We included 285 patients with left-sided infective endocarditis. The incidence of ARA was 21.4% (61 patients). Underlying heart disease, mechanical prosthesis, bicuspid aortic valve, and prior IE were significantly higher in ARA. The level of CRP was higher in ARA (p = 0.03). ARA group showed more aortic valve vegetations (73.8% vs. 37.1%, p < 0.001), more aortic paravalvular leakage (26.7% vs. 4.5%, p < 0.001), and less mitral valve vegetations (21.3% vs. 68.8%, p < 0.001). Logistic regression analysis showed that the odds of ARA increased in the following conditions: aortic paravalvular leak (OR 3.9, 95% CI 1.2-13, p = 0.03), mechanical prosthesis (OR 3.6, 95% CI 1.5-8.7, p = 0.005), aortic valve vegetations (OR 3.0, 95% CI 1.2-8.0, p = 0.02), and undetected organism (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.1-4.6, p = 0.02), while the odds of ARA decreased with mitral valve vegetations (OR 0.2, 95% CI 0.08-0.5, p = 0.001). We did not find a difference between both groups regarding the incidence of major complications, including in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSION: In our study, ARA occurred in one fifth of patients with left-sided IE. Patients with mechanical prosthesis, aortic paravalvular leakage, aortic vegetations, and undetected organisms had higher odds of ARA, while patients with mitral vegetations had lower odds of ARA.  
Brachial Mycotic Pseudoaneurysms Due to Prosthetic Valve Infective Endocarditis: A Case Report and Review of the Literature.  ;Brachial mycotic pseudoaneurysms (BMPA) are a rare complication of infective endocarditis (IE), but potentially could be a limb-threatening condition. We present the case of a 38-year-old male referred to our department, complaining of the sudden onset of a painful pulsatile mass 5 x 10 cm in the right antecubital fossa that slowly progressed over time. Two years before this, he underwent aortic and mitral valve replacement with mechanical prosthetic valves and tricuspid annuloplasty for IE with methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus after a six-week course of intravenous antibiotherapy with oxacillin. Clinical examination of the right upper limb revealed a pulsatile and compressible mass with a normal temperature and without other clinical signs of inflammation. Pulse of the axillary artery, brachial and radial arteries were palpable. He was diagnosed by Doppler ultrasonography and digital subtraction angiography with BMPA. Furthermore, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) revealed normal function of the aortic and mitral prosthetic valve with no signs of prosthetic valve endocarditis and no feature of congestive heart failure. Considering these clinical findings, surgical treatment was planned. He underwent re-section of the brachial pseudoaneurysm and arterial reconstruction. One year after the pseudoaneurysm resection, evolution was excellent. This manuscript presents this rare, uncommon complication after IE and also reviews the available surgical management strategies for this pathology.  
Integrative Multi-Omics Analysis in Calcific Aortic Valve Disease Reveals a Link to the Formation of Amyloid-Like Deposits.  ;Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is the most prevalent valvular heart disease in the developed world, yet no pharmacological therapy exists. Here, we hypothesize that the integration of multiple omic data represents an approach towards unveiling novel molecular networks in CAVD. Databases were searched for CAVD omic studies. Differentially expressed molecules from calcified and control samples were retrieved, identifying 32 micro RNAs (miRNA), 596 mRNAs and 80 proteins. Over-representation pathway analysis revealed platelet degranulation and complement/coagulation cascade as dysregulated pathways. Multi-omics integration of overlapping proteome/transcriptome molecules, with the miRNAs, identified a CAVD protein-protein interaction network containing seven seed genes (apolipoprotein A1 (APOA1), hemoglobin subunit β (HBB), transferrin (TF), α-2-macroglobulin (A2M), transforming growth factor β-induced protein (TGFBI), serpin family A member 1 (SERPINA1), lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP), inter-α-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain 3 (ITIH3) and immunoglobulin κ constant (IGKC)), four input miRNAs (miR-335-5p, miR-3663-3p, miR-21-5p, miR-93-5p) and two connector genes (amyloid beta precursor protein (APP) and transthyretin (TTR)). In a metabolite-gene-disease network, Alzheimer's disease exhibited the highest degree of betweenness. To further strengthen the associations based on the multi-omics approach, we validated the presence of APP and TTR in calcified valves from CAVD patients by immunohistochemistry. Our study suggests a novel molecular CAVD network potentially linked to the formation of amyloid-like structures. Further investigations on the associated mechanisms and therapeutic potential of targeting amyloid-like deposits in CAVD may offer significant health benefits.  
Transforming growth factor-β1 promotes fibrosis but attenuates calcification of valvular tissue applied as three-dimensional calcific aortic valve disease model.  ;Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is characterized by valvular fibrosis and calcification and driven by differentiating valvular interstitial cells (VICs). Expression data from patient biopsies suggest that TGF-β1 is implicated in CAVD pathogenesis. However, CAVD models using isolated VICs failed to deliver clear evidence on the role of TGF-β1. Thus, employing cultures of aortic valve leaflets we investigated effects of TGF-β1 in a tissue-based three-dimensional (3-D) CAVD model. We found that TGF-β1 induced phosphorylation of SMAD3 and expression of SMAD7 indicating effective downstream signal transduction in valvular tissue. Thus, TGF-β1 increased VIC contents of rough ER, Golgi and secretory vesicles as well as tissue levels of RNA and protein. In addition, TGF-β1 raised expression of proliferation marker cyclin D1, attenuated VIC apoptosis and upregulated VIC density. Moreover, TGF-β1 intensified myofibroblastic VIC differentiation as evidenced by increased α-SMA and collagen type I along with diminished vimentin expression. In contrast, TGF-β1 attenuated phosphorylation of SMAD1/5/8 and upregulation of β-catenin while inhibiting osteoblastic VIC differentiation as revealed by downregulation of osteocalcin expression, ALP activity and ECM incorporation of hydroxyapatite. Collectively, these effects resulted in blocking of valvular tissue calcification and associated disintegration of collagen fibers. Instead, TGF-β1 induced development of fibrosis. Overall, in a tissue-based 3-D CAVD model TGF-β1 intensifies expressional and proliferative activation along with myofibroblastic differentiation of VICs thus triggering dominant fibrosis. Simultaneously, by inhibiting SMAD1/5/8 activation and canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling TGF-β1 attenuates osteoblastic VIC differentiation thus blocking valvular tissue calcification. These findings question a general phase-independent CAVD-promoting role of TGF-β1.  
Predictors of hospital mortality after surgery for ischemic mitral regurgitation: the Toronto General Hospital experience.  ;"BACKGROUND: The benefit of mitral valve repair (MVr) over replacement in patients with severe ischemic mitral regurgitation (IMR) is still controversial. We report our early postoperative outcomes of repair versus replacement. METHODS: Data were collected for patients undergoing first-time mitral valve surgery for severe IMR between 1990 and 2009 (n = 393). Patients who underwent combined procedures for papillary muscle rupture, post-infarction ventricular septal defect, endocarditis, or any previous cardiac surgery were excluded. Preoperative demographics, operative variables, and hospital outcomes were analyzed, and multivariable regression analysis was employed to identify independent predictors of hospital mortality. RESULTS: Valve repair was performed in 42% (n = 164) of patients and replacement in 58% (n = 229). Patients who underwent replacement were older and had a higher prevalence of unstable angina, New York Heart Association Class IV symptoms, preoperative cardiogenic shock, preoperative myocardial infarction, peripheral vascular disease, renal failure, and urgent or emergency surgery (all p < .05). Unadjusted hospital mortality was higher in patients undergoing valve replacement (13% vs. 5%; p = .01). Valve repair was associated with a lower prevalence of postoperative low cardiac output syndrome. Multivariable analysis revealed that age, urgency of operation, and preoperative left ventricular (LV) function were independent predictors of hospital mortality. Importantly, MVr versus replacement was not an independent predictor of hospital mortality. CONCLUSION: Our data did not suggest an early survival benefit to MVr over replacement for IMR. However, age, LV dysfunction, and the need for urgent surgery were independently associated with hospital mortality.  "
COVID-19: A perspective from Iran.  ;The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has presented unique challenges to healthcare systems the world over. The management of the current pandemic places a huge strain on healthcare sectors and demands new strategies on a global level. We herein review the latest epidemiologic data on the COVID-19 pandemic, the Iranian healthcare system's response, and the impact on cardiac surgery practice in Iran.  
Rapid progression of mitral valve disease in a child with Noonan syndrome.  ;Noonan syndrome is the second most common genetic syndrome associated with congenital heart disease after Trisomy 21. The two most common cardiac lesions associated with Noonan syndrome are pulmonary stenosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Although the incidence of mitral valve disease in Noonan syndrome ranges between 2 and 6%, rapid progression of mitral valve dysplasia causing severe mitral valve regurgitation and left atrial dilatation is seldom seen. Most cases of mitral valve disease have been diagnosed either on routine echocardiographic surveillance or when presented with heart failure symptoms. We describe an 18-month-old boy with Noonan syndrome presenting in atrial flutter due to a massively enlarged left atrium caused by severe mitral valve regurgitation which developed and progressed in less than 17 months.

MicroRNA-34c Inhibits Osteogenic Differentiation and Valvular Interstitial Cell Calcification via STC1-Mediated JNK Pathway in Calcific Aortic Valve Disease.  ;Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD), a common heart valve disease, is increasingly prevalent worldwide and causes high morbidity and mortality. Here, we aimed to investigate a possible role for miR-34c in the development of osteogenic differentiation during CAVD and to find out the underlying mechanisms. Valvular interstitial cells (VICs) were isolated from the clinical aortic valve tissue samples of CAVD patients and patients with acute aortic dissection and collected. Then, RT-qPCR was performed to determine miR-34c expression and western blot analysis was applied to confirm the relevant protein expression in these VICs. Dual luciferase reporter gene assay was applied to confirm the relation between miR-34c and STC1. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) staining and alizarin red staining was performed to further confirm the degree of calcification in these samples. MiR-34c was lowly expressed and STC1 was highly expressed in the CAVD tissues. Furthermore, STC1 was the target of miR-34c and was negatively regulated by miR-34c. Overexpression of miR-34c in VICs was concomitant with suppression of both STC1 expression and phosphorylation level of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). In addition, significant decrease of bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP2) and osteocalcin, as well as the decrease of calcification degree were also observed in VICs with miR-34c overexpressed. Taken together, miR-34c could inhibit osteogenic differentiation and calcification of VICs by suppressing the STC1/JNK signaling pathway in CAVD, making miR-34c a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of CAVD.  
Delayed Diagnosis and Treatment of a Critically Ill Patient with Infective Endocarditis Due to a False-Positive Molecular Diagnostic Test for SARS-CoV-2.  ;BACKGROUND The worldwide spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-COV-2) has created unprecedented situations for healthcare professionals and healthcare systems. Although infection with this virus is considered the main health problem currently, other diseases are still prevalent. CASE REPORT This report describes a 59-year-old man who presented with symptoms of dyspnea and fever that were attributed to Covid-19 infection. His clinical condition deteriorated and further examinations revealed a subjacent severe aortic regurgitation due to acute infective endocarditis. Surgical treatment was successful. CONCLUSIONS The results of diagnostic tests for Covid-19 should be re-evaluated whenever there are clinical mismatches or doubts, as false-positive Covid-19 test results can occur. Clinical interpretation should not be determined exclusively by the Covid-19 pandemic. This case report highlights the importance of using validated and approved serological and molecular testing to detect infection with SARS-CoV-2, and to repeat tests when there is doubt about presenting symptoms.  
Cardiovascular imaging modalities in the diagnosis and management of rheumatic heart disease.  ;Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) is prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa, where the capacity for diagnosis and evaluation of disease severity and complications is not always optimal. While the medical history and physical examination are important in the assessment of patients suspected to have RHD, cardiovascular imaging techniques are useful for confirmation of the diagnosis. Echocardiography is the workhorse modality for initial evaluation and diagnosis of RHD. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance is complementary and may provide additive information, including tissue characteristics, where echocardiography is inadequate or non-diagnostic. There is emerging evidence on the role of computed tomography, particularly following valve replacement surgery, in the monitoring and management of RHD. This article summarises the techniques used in imaging RHD patients, considers the evidence base for their utility, discusses their limitations and recognises the clinical contexts in which indications and imaging with various modalities are expanding.  
Treatment of aortic valve endocarditis with stented or stentless valve.  ;OBJECTIVE: The study objective was to provide evidence for choosing a bioprosthesis in treating patients with active aortic valve endocarditis. METHODS: From 1998 to 2017, 265 patients with active aortic valve endocarditis underwent aortic valve replacement with a stented valve (n = 97, 37%) or a stentless valve (n = 168, 63%) with further breakdown into inclusion technique (n = 142, 85%) or total root replacement (n = 26, 15%). Data were obtained from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons database aided with chart review, surveys, and National Death Index data. RESULTS: The median age of patients was 53 years (43-56) in the stented group and 57 years (44-66) in the stentless group. The stented and stentless groups had high rates of heart failure (54% and 40%), liver disease (16% and 7.7%), prosthetic valve endocarditis (14% and 48%), root abscess (38% and 70%), and concomitant ascending aorta procedures (6.2% and 22%), respectively. The stentless group required permanent pacemakers in 11% of cases. Operative mortality was similar between groups (6.2% and 7.1%). The 5-year survival was 52% and 63% in the stented and stentless groups, respectively. Significant risk factors for long-term mortality included liver disease (hazard ratio, 2.38), previous myocardial infarction (hazard ratio, 1.64), congestive heart failure (hazard ratio, 1.63), and renal failure requiring dialysis (hazard ratio, 4.37). The 10-year cumulative incidence of reoperation was 12% and 3.4% for the stented and stentless groups, respectively. The 10-year freedom from reoccurrence of aortic valve endocarditis was 88% for the stented and 98% for the stentless groups. CONCLUSIONS: Both stented and stentless aortic valves are appropriate conduits for replacement of active aortic valve endocarditis for select patients.  
Late Surgical Treatment for Transcatheter Aortic Valve Prosthesis Dysfunction.  ;Structural valve degeneration (SVD), valve thrombosis (VT), or acute infective endocarditis (IE) may affect post-procedural outcome of transcatheter aortic valve implanted (TAVI) prostheses. Data of patients who had late surgical explant of TAVI prostheses were obtained from eight European centers. Thirteen patients underwent surgical treatment for TAVI prosthesis failure after original admission due to prosthetic IE in six cases, SVD in four cases, and VT in three patients. Hospital mortality was 15%, and survival at 2-year follow up was 71%.  
Hybrid treatment of aortic aneurism, type-A dissection, and aortic valve stenosis.  ;Hybrid multidisciplinary interventions are attractive care options for heart valve and vascular diseases in high-risk patients. We describe the feasibility of staged hybrid aortic arch repair to treat a type Ia endoleak and transcatheter aortic valve replacement to treat an aortic valve stenosis, achieving an escape strategy to treat an unexpected type-A aortic dissection.  
The role of inflammation and metabolic risk factors in the pathogenesis of calcific aortic valve stenosis.  ;Given the epidemiologic increase of aged population in the world, aortic stenosis (AS) represents now the most common valvular heart disease in industrialized countries. It is a very challenging disease, representing an important cause of morbidity, hospitalization and death in the elderly population. It is widely recognized that AS is the result of a very complex active process, driven by inflammation and involving multifactorial pathological mechanisms promoting valvular calcification and valvular bone deposition. Several evidence suggest that epicardial adipose tissue (EAT), the visceral fat depot of the heart, represents a direct source of cytokines and could mediate the deleterious effects of systemic inflammation on the myocardium. Importantly, obesity and metabolic disorders are associated with chronic systemic inflammation leading to a significant increase of EAT amount and to a pro-inflammatory phenotypic shift of this fat depot. It has been hypothesized that the EAT inflammatory state can influence the structure and function of the heart, thus contributing to the pathogenesis of several cardiac diseases, including calcific AS. The current review will discuss the recently discovered mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of AS, with particular attention to the role of inflammation, metabolic risk factors and pro-fibrotic and pro-osteogenic signal pathways promoting the onset and progression of the disease. Moreover, it will be explored the potential role of EAT in the AS pathophysiology.  
Left-sided heart disease and risk of death in patients with end-stage kidney disease receiving haemodialysis: an observational study.  ;BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death in patients with end-stage kidney disease on haemodialysis. The potential clinical consequence of systematic echocardiographic assessment is however not clear. In an unselected, contemporary population of patients on maintenance haemodialysis we aimed to assess: the prevalence of structural and functional heart disease, the potential therapeutic consequences of echocardiographic screening and whether left-sided heart disease is associated with prognosis. METHODS: Adult chronic haemodialysis patients in two large dialysis centres had transthoracic echocardiography performed prior to dialysis and were followed prospectively. Significant left-sided heart disease was defined as moderate or severe left-sided valve disease or left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤40%. RESULTS: Among the 247 included patients (mean 66 years of age [95%CI 64-67], 68% male), 54 (22%) had significant left-sided heart disease. An LVEF ≤40% was observed in 31 patients (13%) and severe or moderate valve disease in 27 (11%) patients. The findings were not previously recognized in more than half of the patients (56%) prior to the study. Diagnosis had a potential impact on management in 31 (13%) patients including for 18 (7%) who would benefit from initiation of evidence-based heart failure therapy. After 2.8 years of follow-up, all-cause mortality among patients with and without left-sided heart disease was 52 and 32% respectively (hazard ratio [HR] 1.95 (95%CI 1.25-3.06). A multivariable adjusted Cox proportional hazard analysis showed that left-sided heart disease was an independent predictor of mortality with a HR of 1.60 (95%CI 1.01-2.55) along with age (HR per year 1.05 [95%CI 1.03-1.07]). CONCLUSION: Left ventricular systolic dysfunction and moderate to severe valve disease are common and often unrecognized in patients with end-stage kidney failure on haemodialysis and are associated with a higher risk of death. For more than 10% of the included patients, systematic echocardiographic assessment had a potential clinical consequence.  
Mechanical Support of the Failing Fontan Circulation.  ;The Fontan is the final common pathway for most single ventricle lesions. It is not a durable circulation and many Fontan patients eventually present for advanced heart failure therapies including mechanical circulatory support. While there have been advancements in available durable devices, many pediatric patients have size, anatomical, and physiologic constraints that make placement of adult ventricular assist devices challenging. And, Fontan failure comes in different varieties, including failure with preserved systolic function. This subset of patients requires either a subpulmonary assist device or a total artificial heart. Unique operative maneuvers, including atrial cannulation and atrioventricular valve manipulation have allowed many failing Fontan patients to be bridged to transplant after recovery of end-organ dysfunction and improved nutrition. The Advanced Cardiac Therapies Improving Outcomes Network is a multicenter learning network of pediatric hospitals implanting, managing, and studying ventricular assist devices in children and adults with congenital heart disease. This network is advancing the knowledge of outcomes and approaches to mechanical circulatory support in those with congenital heart disease, including Fontans. The congenital heart disease community continues to work toward and hope for a smaller durable device that will help this complex cohort of patients.  
Tricuspid Valve Anterior Leaflet Strains in Ovine Functional Tricuspid Regurgitation.  ;Functional tricuspid regurgitation (FTR) is thought to arise due to annular dilation and alteration of right ventricular (RV) geometry in the presence of normal leaflets, yet mitral leaflets have been shown to remodel significantly in functional mitral regurgitation. We set out to evaluate tricuspid valve anterior leaflet deformations in ovine FTR. Eleven animals (FTR group) underwent implantation of a pacemaker with high rate pacing to induce biventricular dysfunction and at least moderate TR. Subsequently, both FTR (n = 11) and Control (n = 12) animals underwent implantation of 6 sonomicrometry crystals around the tricuspid annulus, 4 on the anterior leaflet, and 14 on RV epicardium. Tricuspid valve geometry and anterior leaflet strains were calculated from crystal coordinates. Left ventricular ejection fraction and RV fractional area change were significantly lower in FTR animals versus Control. Tricuspid annular area, septo-lateral diameter, RV pressures were all significantly greater in the FTR group. Mean TR grade (+0-3) was 0.7 ± 0.5 in Control and 2.4 ± 0.5 in FTR (P = < 0.001). The anterior leaflet area and length increased significantly. Global radial leaflet strain was significantly lower in FTR mostly driven by decreased free edge leaflet strain. Global circumferential anterior leaflet strain was also significantly lower in FTR with more remarkable reduction in the belly region. Rapid ventricular pacing in sheep resulted in a clinically pertinent model of RV and annular dilation with FTR and leaflet enlargement. Both circumferential and radial anterior leaflet strains were significantly reduced with FTR. Functional TR may be associated with alteration of leaflet mechanical properties.  
Corynebacterium Jeikeium Endocarditis: A Review of the Literature.  ;Corynebacterium jeikeium is a gram-positive, aerobic, pleomorphic, non-spore forming bacillus, commonly present on the skin surface. Infective endocarditis secondary to C. jeikeium most commonly affects left-sided heart valves and has a higher likelihood to require valve replacement compared to other Corynebacterium endocarditis. C. jeikeium endocarditis is extremely difficult to treat as it is characteristically resistant to penicillin, cephalosporins and aminoglycosides, and sensitivity to quinolones, macrolides, tetracyclines and rifampin is variable. Despite treatment, mortality rates as high as 33% have been reported. We hereby review the literature regarding the epidemiology, diagnosis and treatment of this deadly microorganism.

Outcomes following aortic valve procedures in 201 complex congenital heart disease cases-results from the UK National Audit.  ;OBJECTIVES: Some patients with complex congenital heart disease (cCHD) also require aortic valve (AoV) procedures. These cases are considered high risk but their outcome has not been well characterized. We aim to describe these scenarios in the current practice, and provide outcome data for counselling and decision-making. METHODS: This was a retrospective study using the UK National Congenital Heart Disease Audit data on cCHD patients undergoing aortic valve replacement, balloon dilation (balloon aortic valvuloplasty) or surgical repair (surgical aortic valve repair) between 2000 and 2012. Coarsened exact matching was used to pair cCHD with patients undergoing AoV procedures for isolated valve disease. RESULTS: A total of 201 patients with a varied spectrum of cCHD undergoing 242 procedures were included, median age 9.4 years (1 day-65 years). Procedure types were: balloon aortic valvuloplasty (n = 31, 13%), surgical aortic valve repair (n = 57, 24%) and aortic valve replacement (n = 154, 63%). Mortality at 30 days was higher in neonates (21.8% vs 5.3%, P = 0.02). Survival at 10 years was 83.1%, freedom from aortic valve replacement 83.8% and freedom from balloon aortic valvuloplasty/surgical aortic valve repair 86.3%. Neonatal age (P < 0.001), single ventricle (P = 0.08), concomitant Fontan/Glenn (P = 0.002) or aortic arch procedures (0.02) were associated with higher mortality. cCHD patients had lower survival at 30 days (93% vs 100%, P = 0.003) and at 10 years (86.4% vs 96.1%, P = 0.005) compared to matched isolated AoV disease patients. CONCLUSIONS: AoV procedures in cCHD can be performed with good results outside infancy, but with higher mortality than in isolated AoV disease. Neonates and patients with single ventricle defects, especially those undergoing concomitant Fontan/Glenn, have worse outcomes.  
Isolated tricuspid valve surgery: impact of aetiology and clinical presentation on outcomes.  ;AIMS: The aim of this study was to identify determinants of in-hospital and mid-term outcomes after isolated tricuspid valve surgery (ITVS) and more specifically the impact of tricuspid regurgitation (TR) mechanism and clinical presentation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Among 5661 consecutive adult patients who underwent a tricuspid valve (TV) surgery at 12 French tertiary centres in 2007-2017 collected from a mandatory administrative database, we identified 466 patients (8% of all tricuspid surgeries) who underwent an ITVS. Most patients presented with advanced disease [47% in New York Heart Association (NYHA) III/IV, 57% with right-sided heart failure (HF) signs]. Tricuspid regurgitation was functional in 49% (22% with prior left-sided heart valve surgery and 27% isolated) and organic in 51% (infective endocarditis in 31% and other causes in 20%). In-hospital mortality and major complications rates were 10% and 31%, respectively. Rates of survival and survival free of HF readmission were 75% and 62% at 5 years. Patients with functional TR incurred a worse in-hospital mortality than those with organic TR (14% vs. 6%, P = 0.004), but presentation was more severe. Independent determinants of outcomes were NYHA Class III/IV [odd ratios (OR) = 2.7 (1.2-6.1), P = 0.01], moderate/severe right ventricular dysfunction [OR = 2.6 (1.2-5.8), P = 0.02], lower prothrombin time [OR = 0.98 (0.96-0.99), P = 0.008], and with borderline statistical significance, right-sided HF signs [OR = 2.4 (0.9-6.5), P = 0.06] while TR mechanism was not [OR = 0.7 (0.3-1.8), P = 0.88]. CONCLUSION: Isolated TV surgery was associated with high mortality and morbidity, both in hospital and during follow-up, predicted by the severity of the presentation but not by TR mechanism. Our results suggest that TV intervention should be performed earlier in the course of the disease.  
Repetitive out of hospital cardiac arrests following pregnancy: a case report of an unfortunate presentation of mitral annular disjunction.  ;BACKGROUND: Mitral annular disjunction (MAD) is an under-recognized cause of arrhythmic sudden cardiac death, especially in young women. The relation between MAD and the occurrence of arrhythmia during pregnancy has not yet been explored. We would like to stress the importance of careful echocardiographic examination and the vulnerable peripartum period. CASE SUMMARY: A 29-year-old woman survived an out of hospital cardiac arrest 4 months after delivery of her first child. The diagnosis was not clear and an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) as secondary prevention was implanted. Her second pregnancy and delivery were uneventful. The 12-lead electrocardiogram demonstrated sinus rhythm with right bundle branch block, ventricular extra systoles (premature ventricular contractions), and a right superior axis, i.e. origin in the inferolateral basal left ventricle. Transthoracic 2D echocardiography showed myxomatous mitral valve disease with moderate mitral valve insufficiency with normal left and right heart dimensions and function. However, 4 weeks after delivery she experienced a sudden syncope at home. Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator reading revealed primary ventricular fibrillation, induced by a ventricular premature beat (VPB), terminated with a successful ICD shock. A frame-by-frame echocardiographic analysis of the mitral valve using biplane echocardiographic analysis allowed diagnosis of MAD with detachment of the root of the annulus from the posterolateral ventricular myocardium during systole. CONCLUSION: Mitral annular disjunction is an under-recognized cause of arrhythmic sudden cardiac death. Biplane echocardiographic analysis of the mitral annulus can identify MAD and as such may help for risk stratification and sudden cardiac death prevention. Careful follow-up is necessary especially during pregnancy and the postpartum period.  
Delayed patch repair of a ruptured mitral subvalvular pseudoaneurysm caused by infective endocarditis: a case report.  ;"BACKGROUND: Ruptured subvalvular pseudoaneurysm is a rare but significantly fatal complication of infective endocarditis. We report a successful surgical case of ruptured subvalvular pseudoaneurysm with infective endocarditis. CASE SUMMARY: A 46-year-old man presenting with high fever was admitted to a local hospital. Physical examination revealed small erythema and petechiae on his lower limbs. Transthoracic echocardiogram did not show any visible vegetation and valvular disease; however, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed multiple acute cerebral infractions, and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus was detected in the blood culture. Infective endocarditis was suspected, and an antibacterial medication was initiated. Twelve days later, he suffered from a sudden cardiogenic shock due to cardiac tamponade. Bloody pericardial effusion (1600 mL) was drained, and his condition improved substantially. Transoesophageal echocardiography after pericardial drainage revealed severe mitral regurgitation and a subvalvular aneurysm at the posteromedial side of the mitral annulus; these were not detected at the time of admission. He was transferred to our hospital for surgery; however, since fresh cerebral bleeding was observed in MRI, the surgery was delayed. Three weeks later, after confirming that the blood culture was negative for any growth, patch repair of the subvalvular pseudoaneurysm and mitral valve repair were performed. Post-operatively, no complication or arrhythmia was observed; he was discharged 25 days later. DISCUSSION: We report a rare case of successful delayed surgery for a ruptured subvalvular pseudoaneurysm at the posteromedial side of the mitral annulus, which presented complications for infective endocarditis by S. aureus.

Leaflet thrombosis after valve-in-valve transcatheter aortic valve implantation: a case series.  ;BACKGROUND: Valve-in-valve transcatheter aortic valve implantation (ViV-TAVI) in degenerated surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) is an alternative to redo-SAVR. However, reports on leaflet thrombosis following ViV-TAVI are emerging and subclinical thrombosis has gained recent attention. Although the incidence of transcatheter heart valve (THV) thrombosis after TAVI for native aortic valve disease is low, current imaging studies suggest the incidence of subclinical THV thrombosis may be significantly higher. While anticoagulation strategies for THV patients for native aortic stenosis presenting with symptomatic obstructive thrombosis has been described, the optimal management and anticoagulation therapy of patients with THV thrombosis following ViV-TAVI are less evident. CASE SUMMARY: We report a case series of three patients presenting with early and late THV thrombosis after ViV-TAVI. Two patients presented clinically on single antiplatelet therapy and one patient presented with subclinical valve thrombosis whilst taking a non-vitamin K oral anticoagulation agent. DISCUSSION: Leaflet thrombosis after ViV-TAVI is an important cause of THV degeneration and may present subclinically. Imaging modalities such as serial transthoracic echocardiograms and multidetector computerized tomography aid diagnosis and guide management. Patient-individualized risk- vs. -benefit prophylactic post-procedural oral anticoagulation may be indicated.  
A case report of Adult-onset Still's disease as a cause of severe mitral regurgitation.  ;BACKGROUND: Adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD) is an uncommon systemic inflammatory disease, causing spiking fever, skin rash, and arthritis. Pericarditis and myocarditis are the most common cardiac manifestation of AOSD but valvular involvement is rarely reported. CASE SUMMARY: An 18-year-old boy presented with gradually worsening shortness of breath for 6 months. There was a history of low-grade intermittent fever and polyarthralgia affecting ankles, knees, and elbows. He was in heart failure with cardiogenic and septic shock. He was managed initially with antibiotics, inotropes, and diuretics. Echocardiography showed flail anterior mitral leaflet with severe mitral regurgitation. He remained febrile with persistent negative blood cultures. Intravenous antibiotics led to neutropenia without any response to fever and clinical status. On further workup, he was diagnosed to have AOSD, and he responded dramatically to oral steroid therapy. Later his mitral valve was replaced surgically. On follow-up, he was stable with mild exertional dyspnoea. His international normalized ratio was in therapeutic range and his follow-up echocardiography showed normally functioning mitral prosthesis. He is following rheumatology and currently on the maintenance dose of steroids. DISCUSSION: Adult-onset Still's disease is a systemic illness with diagnosis is based on clinical features and exclusion of other illnesses. Adult-onset Still's disease should be considered as a differential diagnosis in culture-negative endocarditis, especially in those with systemic features and non-responders to antibiotics.  
A case report of isolated severe valve stenosis in a previous tricuspid valve repair: an integrated multimodality imaging and invasive haemodynamic evaluation.  ;BACKGROUND: Tricuspid valve (TV) stenosis is a very rare condition and the aetiology is primarily due to rheumatic disease, carcinoid disease, congenital heart disease, endocarditis, and following degeneration of biological valve prosthesis. CASE SUMMARY: We present a 45-year-old man with a rare case of symptomatic TV stenosis (TS) in a previously isolated TV repair. A meticulous multimodality diagnostic approach is presented in order to determine the severity of the TS and to evaluate the right ventricular function. DISCUSSION: This case report presents an integrated multimodality imaging and haemodynamic approach to evaluate and document the suspicion of development of a symptomatic significant stenosis in a previous TV repair. The initial TV repair was done without ring annuloplasty, because only the anterior leaflet was affected and bicuspidalization of the valve made it patent. In addition, minimizing the amount of implanted material was intended to minimize the risk of reinfection. The final treatment was performed as a TV replacement with insertion of a bioprosthesis.  
Simultaneous transfemoral valve-in-valve transcatheter aortic valve replacement and debranching thoracic endovascular aortic repair through a tortuous and shaggy aorta: a case report.  ;BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a viable treatment option for managing aortic prosthetic valve dysfunction. Although the transfemoral approach is the most commonly used and preferred treatment strategy for TAVR, complex vascular access, such as aortic aneurysm, severe tortuosity, and shaggy aorta, is challenging. CASE SUMMARY: An 87-year-old man, who underwent surgical aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis using a 21-mm Carpentier-Edwards Perimount Valve, presented with New York Heart Association functional Class III dyspnoea. He was diagnosed as having severe symptomatic structural valve deterioration of a bioprosthetic aortic valve. Computed tomography revealed a tortuous and shaggy descending aorta with a saccular aneurysm in the aortic arch. Simultaneous transfemoral valve-in-valve TAVR and Zone 2 thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) with debranching were successfully performed using a 22-Fr 65-cm sheath. Although the patient developed paraplegia due to transient spinal cord ischaemia associated with TEVAR, he fully recovered with vasopressor therapy. DISCUSSION: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on simultaneous successful 'valve-in-valve' TAVR and debranching TEVAR using the transfemoral approach. This case demonstrated the feasibility of single-stage transfemoral TAVR and TEVAR in a high-risk patient with multicomponent disease.  
Changes in inflammation and oxidative stress signalling pathways in coarcted aorta triggered by bicuspid aortic valve and growth in young children.  ;"Neonates with coarctation of the aorta (CoA) combined with a bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) show significant structural differences compared to neonatal CoA patients with a normal tricuspid aortic valve (TAV). These effects are likely to change over time in response to growth. This study investigated proteomic differences between coarcted aortic tissue of BAV and TAV patients in children older than one month. Aortic tissue just proximal to the coarctation site was collected from 10 children (BAV; n=6, 1.9±1.7 years, TAV; n=4, 1.7±1.5 years, (mean ± SEM, P=0.92.) Tissue were snap frozen, proteins extracted, and the extracts used for proteomic and phosphoproteomic analysis using Tandem Mass Tag (TMT) analysis. A total of 1811 protein and 76 phosphoprotein accession numbers were detected, of which 40 proteins and 6 phosphoproteins were significantly differentially expressed between BAV and TAV patients. Several canonical pathways involved in inflammation demonstrated enriched protein expression, including acute phase response signalling, EIF2 signalling and macrophage production of IL12 and reactive oxygen species. Acute phase response signalling also demonstrated enriched phosphoprotein expression, as did Th17 activation. Other pathways with significantly enriched protein expression include degradation of superoxide radicals and several pathways involved in apoptosis. This work suggests that BAV CoA patients older than one month have an altered proteome consistent with changes in inflammation, apoptosis and oxidative stress compared to TAV CoA patients of the same age. There is no evidence of structural differences, suggesting the pathology associated with BAV evolves with age in paediatric CoA patients.  "
Bicuspid Aortic Valve and Endothelial Dysfunction: Current Evidence and Potential Therapeutic Targets.  ;Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV), the most frequent congenital heart malformation, is characterized by the presence of a two-leaflet aortic valve instead of a three-leaflet one. BAV disease progression is associated with valvular dysfunction (in the form of stenosis or regurgitation) and aortopathy, which can lead to aneurysm and aortic dissection. This morphological abnormality modifies valve dynamics and promotes eccentric blood flow, which gives rise to alterations of the flow pattern and wall shear stress (WSS) of the ascending aorta. Recently, evidence of endothelial dysfunction (ED) in BAV disease has emerged. Different studies have addressed a reduced endothelial functionality by analyzing various molecular biomarkers and cellular parameters in BAV patients. Some authors have found impaired functionality of circulating endothelial progenitors in these patients, associating it with valvular dysfunction and aortic dilation. Others focused on systemic endothelial function by measuring artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD), showing a reduced FMD in BAV individuals. Novel biomarkers like increased endothelial microparticles (EMP), which are related to ED, have also been discovered in BAV patients. Finally, latest studies indicate that in BAV, endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT) may also be de-regulated, which could be caused by genetic, hemodynamic alterations, or both. Different hypothesis about the pathology of ED in BAV are nowadays being debated. Some authors blamed this impaired functionality just on genetic abnormalities, which could lead to a pathological aorta. Nevertheless, thanks to the development of new and high-resolution imaging techniques like 4D flow MRI, hemodynamics has gained great attention. Based on latest studies, alterations in blood flow seem to cause proper modification of the endothelial cells (ECs) function and morphology. It also seems to be associated with aortic dilation and decreased vasodilators expression, like nitric oxide (NO). Although nowadays ED in BAV has been reported by many, it is not clear which its main cause may be. Comprehending the pathways that promote ED and its relevance in BAV could help further understand and maybe prevent the serious consequences of this disease. This review will discuss the ED present in BAV, focusing on the latest evidence, biomarkers for ED and potential therapeutic targets (Figure 1).

Ross Procedures in Children With Previous Aortic Valve Surgery.  ;"BACKGROUND: The Ross procedure in children is performed either as a primary operation, or a secondary operation after initial aortic valve surgery. OBJECTIVES: The study aimed to determine whether the outcomes of primary and secondary Ross procedure are similar. METHODS: All patients who underwent Ross procedure between 1995 and 2018 were included in the study. Outcomes were compared between those who had primary Ross procedure and those who had secondary Ross procedure, after aortic valve surgery. Propensity score matching for baseline characteristics and risk factors for death and reoperation was performed. RESULTS: Of 140 Ross procedures, 51.4% (n = 72 of 140) were primary operations, while 48.6% (n = 68 of 140) were secondary operations. Patients undergoing primary Ross procedure tended to be older (median age 8.6 years vs. 7.0 years; p = 0.10) and have a higher weight (28.9 kg vs. 19.4 kg; p = 0.07). There were no significant differences in survival or freedom from reoperation in the unmatched cohort. Propensity score matching resulted in 50 well-matched pairs. In the matched cohort, survival at 10 years was 90.0% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 77.5% to 95.7%) in the primary Ross group, compared with 96.8% (95% CI: 79.2% to 99.5%) in the secondary Ross group (p = 0.04). Freedom from autograft reoperation at 10 years was 82% (95% CI: 64.1% to 91.5%) in the primary Ross group, compared with 97.0% (95% CI: 80.4% to 99.6%) in the secondary Ross group (p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Secondary Ross procedure performed after initial aortic valve surgery achieves superior long-term survival and freedom from autograft reoperation compared with primary Ross procedure. A strategy of initial aortic valve repair followed by delayed Ross procedure may provide better long-term survival and freedom from autograft reoperation.  "
Biocompatible Nanocomposites Based on Poly(styrene-block-isobutylene-block-styrene) and Carbon Nanotubes for Biomedical Application.  ;"In this study, we incorporated carbon nanotubes (CNTs) into poly(styrene-block-isobutylene-block-styrene) (SIBS) to investigate the physical characteristics of the resulting nanocomposite and its cytotoxicity to endothelial cells. CNTs were dispersed in chloroform using sonication following the addition of a SIBS solution at different ratios. The resultant nanocomposite films were analyzed by X-ray microtomography, optical and scanning electron microscopy; tensile strength was examined by uniaxial tension testing; hydrophobicity was evaluated using a sessile drop technique; for cytotoxicity analysis, human umbilical vein endothelial cells were cultured on SIBS-CNTs for 3 days. We observed an uneven distribution of CNTs in the polymer matrix with sporadic bundles of interwoven nanotubes. Increasing the CNT content from 0 wt% to 8 wt% led to an increase in the tensile strength of SIBS films from 4.69 to 16.48 MPa. The engineering normal strain significantly decreased in 1 wt% SIBS-CNT films in comparison with the unmodified samples, whereas a further increase in the CNT content did not significantly affect this parameter. The incorporation of CNT into the SIBS matrix resulted in increased hydrophilicity, whereas no cytotoxicity towards endothelial cells was noted. We suggest that SIBS-CNT may become a promising material for the manufacture of implantable devices, such as cardiovascular patches or cusps of the polymer heart valve.  "
[Delayed Takotsubo syndrome - A critical perioperative incident].  ;INTRODUCTION:  The term Takotsubo syndrome (TTS) describes a transient ventricular dysfunction. Symptoms and complication rate are similar to those of a myocardial infarction. MEDICAL HISTORY:  An 81-year-old female patient was admitted for thrombendarterectomy of the left femoral artery. Prior to a recent biological aortic valve replacement, coronary heart disease had been ruled out. ANESTHETIC INDUCTION AND CLINICAL FINDINGS:  After induction of anesthesia, relevant arterial hypotension and sinus bradycardia occurred. After catecholamine administration, transient ST segment elevations were observed, which postoperatively developed a myocardial infarction-like dynamic. Echocardiography and values of cardiac enzymes initially revealed no abnormalities. THERAPY, COURSE AND DIAGNOSIS:  After a symptom-free interval the patient developed severe cardiac decompensation on the third postoperative day. At this point, the clinical picture of TTS was visible. Stabilisation of the clinical condition was achieved with levosimendan therapy. CONCLUSION:  Dynamic ECG changes in the perioperative situation always require diﬀerentiated diagnosis and possibly longer monitoring. TTS is a relevant diﬀerential diagnosis because it is subject to severe complications.  
Pulmonary valve annular and right ventricular outflow tract size as predictions values for moderate to severe pulmonary regurgitation after repaired Tetralogy of Fallot.  ;"OBJECTIVE: This study sought to investigate the variation of right heart structure pre- and post-operation as risk factors for moderate to severe pulmonary regurgitation (PR) after repaired Tetralogy of Fallot and the best ""cutoff"" values for the transannular patch (TAP). METHODS: We collected surgical, echocardiographic, and computed tomographic data of Teralogy of Fallot (TOF) patients over two years and calculated z-score values based on the echocardiographic data. Based on the PR level after follow-up, the patients were divided into two groups, trivial to mild PR and moderate to severe PR. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed, and the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to find the best ""cutoff"" value for risk factors. RESULTS: A total of 104 TOF patients were included in our cohort study. From the multivariate analysis, correction strategy (P = .002), difference in zRVOT (OR 1.974, 95% CI 1.354 to 2.878, P < .0001), and zPVA (OR 3.605, 95% CI 1.980 to 6.562, P < .0001) were the significant risk factors for moderate to severe PR. The ""cutoff"" value for the difference in zPVA that could predict moderate to severe PR in the TAP group was 3, and the optimal ""cutoff"" value for TAP was -1.4. CONCLUSIONS: The TAP is a risk factor for significant PR after surgery. We recommend the optimal ""cutoff"" value for TAP is -1.4 calculated using Shan-Shan Wang's data set. During the procedure, to limit the RVOT resection and restrict the enlargement of pulmonary annulus within a variation of z-score as 3 would reduce significant PR.  "
Long-term follow-up of resection of primary benign right ventricular tumours: a 10-year surgical experience.  ;"INTRODUCTION: Primary benign right ventricular tumours are rare. They can cause significant mortality without appropriate and timely treatment. We investigated surgical treatment and survival characteristics for right ventricular tumours. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From 2007 to 2017, 21 patients with primary benign right ventricular tumours who underwent tumour resection were retrospectively reviewed. Clinical findings and follow-up results were analysed. RESULTS: Thirteen men and eight women were enrolled, with a mean age of 42.3 ± 15.3 years. The most frequent histotypes were myxoma, haemangioma and papillary fibroelastoma. Eight patients underwent concomitant tricuspid valvuloplasty and one had tricuspid valve replacement. No major adverse events or death occurred during the perioperative period. One patient with haemangioma underwent partial tumour resection; however, the tumour regressed gradually during follow-up. Within the 10-year follow-up period (mean 4.8 ± 2.6 years), the recurrence-free and overall survival rates were 81.0% and 85.7%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Tumour resection for primary benign right ventricular tumours is safe and effective, and has a good prognosis. Tricuspid valvuloplasty or tricuspid valve replacement may be necessary for the resection of right ventricular tumours to improve the haemodynamics. Haemangiomas naturally undergo spontaneous regression.  "
Impact of chronic kidney disease on in-hospital outcomes and readmission rate after edge-to-edge transcatheter mitral valve repair.  ;BACKGROUND: Transcatheter mitral valve repair (TMVR) is a treatment option for patients with 3+ or greater mitral regurgitation who cannot undergo mitral valve surgery. Outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end stage renal disease (ESRD) are unclear. We sought to evaluate the TMVR in-hospital outcomes, readmission rates and its impact on kidney function. METHODS: Data from 2016 National Readmission Database was used to obtain all patients who underwent TMVR. Patients were classified by their CKD status: no CKD, CKD, or ESRD. The primary outcomes were: in-hospital mortality, 30- and 90-day readmission rate, and change in CKD status on readmission. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to assess in-hospital, readmission outcomes and kidney function stage. RESULTS: A total of 4,645 patients were assessed (mean age 78.5 ± 10.3 years). In-hospital mortality was higher in patients with CKD (4.0%, odds ratio [OR]:2.01 [95% CI, confidence interval: 1.27-3.18]) and ESRD (6.6%, OR: 6.38 [95% CI: 1.49-27.36]) compared with non-CKD (2.4%). 30-day readmission rate was higher in ESRD versus non-CKD patients (17.8% vs. 10.4%, OR: 2.24 [95% CI: 1.30-3.87]) as was 90-day readmission (41.2% vs. 21% OR: 2.51 [95% CI:1.70-3.72]). Kidney function improved in 25% of patients with CKD stage 3 and in 50% with CKD stage 4-5 at 30-and 90-day readmission. Incidence of AKI, major bleeding, and respiratory failure were higher in CKD group. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with CKD and ESRD have worse outcomes and higher readmission rate after TMVR. In patients who were readmitted after TMVR, renal function improved in some patients, suggesting that TMVR could potentially improve CKD stage.  
Is obesity associated with poorer outcomes in patients undergoing minimally invasive mitral valve surgery?  ;"OBJECTIVES: High body mass index (BMI) makes minimally invasive mitral valve surgery (MIMVS) more challenging with some surgeons considering this a contraindication. We sought to determine whether this is because the outcomes are genuinely worse than those of non-obese patients. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of all patients undergoing MIMVS ± concomitant procedures over an 8-year period. Patients were stratified into 2 groups: BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 and BMI ˂ 30 kg/m2, as per World Health Organization definitions. Baseline characteristics, operative and postoperative outcomes and 5-year survival were compared. RESULTS: We identified 296 patients (BMI ≥30, n = 41, median 35.3, range 30-43.6; BMI <30, n = 255, median 26.2, range 17.6-29.9). The groups were well matched with regard to baseline characteristics. There was only 1 in-hospital mortality, and this was in the BMI < 30 group. There was no difference in repair rate for degenerative disease (100% vs 96.3%, P > 0.99 respectively) or operative durations [cross-clamp: 122 min interquartile range (IQR) 100-141) vs 125 min (IQR 105-146), P = 0.72, respectively]. There were only 6 conversions to sternotomy, all in non-obese patients. There was no significant difference in any other perioperative or post-operative outcomes. Using the Kaplan-Meier analysis, there was no significant difference in 5-year survival between the 2 groups (95.8% vs 95.5%, P = 0.83, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: In patients having MIMVS, there is insufficient evidence to suggest that obesity affects either short- or mid-term outcomes. Obesity should therefore not be considered as a contraindication to this technique for experienced teams.  "
Are dilated ascending aortas of Chinese patients more likely to dissect?  ;BACKGROUND: Ascending aortic aneurysm is a disease requiring surgical intervention. However, the timing of operation is still controversial. The purpose of this study is to compare the ascending aortic diameter and postoperative outcomes in hospital between patients with simple ascending aortic dissection and patients with simple ascending aortic dilation in China, and to investigate the accuracy of the timing of operation determined by ascending aortic diameter alone. METHODS: We reviewed the data from 2,520 hospitalized patients of aortic aneurysm and aortic dissection who underwent surgical treatment from January 2010 to June 2017 in our hospital. A total of 139 simple ascending aortic dissection and simple ascending aortic aneurysm hospitalized patients excluding Marfan syndrome and heart valve diseases etc. (56 in the aortic dilatation group and 83 in the aortic dissection group) were enrolled. The t-test and univariable analysis were used to compare the differences between two groups. RESULTS: For the aortic diameter, the group of aneurysm has greater ascending aortic diameter and the index of ascending aortic diameter compared with the group of dissection (P<0.001, P<0.001). For male patients, the result is the same (P<0.001, P<0.001). But for female patients, there was no significant statistical significance between the two groups (P=0.631, P=0.288). For the postoperative outcomes, the dissection group had higher mortality, incidence of tracheotomy and postoperative re-exploration for hemorrhage (P=0.040, P=0.011, P=0.028). CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients with simple ascending aortic dissection present with aortic diameters <5.5 cm and this is not consistent with the current operation indications of aortic aneurysm. It is far from enough to predict aortic dissection with aortic diameter alone. More indicators are needed to do this.  
Isolated Flailed P3 Scallop of the Mitral Valve Leaflet in the Setting of Newly Diagnosed Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction.  ;Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is characterized by typical fibromyxomatous changes in the mitral leaflet tissue with superior displacement of one or both leaflets into the left atrium. An echocardiogram is a fundamental study required for the diagnosis of MVP with a flail leaflet and grading of mitral regurgitation (MR) severity. Most patients with MVP have a risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality similar to that of the general population, though moderate to severe MR and left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction less than 50% have been postulated to increase the risk of adverse cardiac events. In this case report, we present an isolated flailed P3 scallop of the mitral valve leaflet leading to severe MR and acute congestive heart failure. A 54-year-old African-American male with a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and transient ischemic attack, presented to the emergency department (ED) for evaluation of dyspnea on exertion. The patient reported that his dyspnea started one week prior to ED visit and was associated with intermittent chest pain. He also endorsed mild orthopnea and lightheadedness, though he denied any syncopal event. Vital signs were found within normal limits on arrival. He clinically appeared to be volume overloaded which improved quickly with IV furosemide. Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) with 3D image acquisition showed significant for hyper-dynamic LV function and evidence of isolated flailed P3 scallop of the mitral valve (MV) leaflet resulting in a severe eccentric, anteriorly directed MR jet. The MV leaflets did not appear thickened, and there was no evidence of mitral or aortic stenosis. Cardiac catheterization showed multivessel disease for which the patient underwent coronary artery bypass grafting and MV repair. This patient presented with new-onset congestive heart failure secondary to severe MR associated with undiagnosed MVP. Commonly, the middle scallop (P2) of the posterior leaflet is more prone to prolapse due to its redundancy and variable thickness with the impact of greater systolic pressure. However, in this case of acute severe MR, we identified an isolated flail of the P3 segment. We believe that this rare TEE finding was associated with a torn chordae or ruptured papillary muscle secondary to ischemic disease as the posteromedial papillary muscle has a single blood supply and is particularly prompted to injury from myocardial infarction.  
Advances in Engineering Venous Valves: The Pursuit of a Definite Solution for Chronic Venous Disease.  ;Native venous valves enable proper return of blood to the heart. Under pathological conditions (e.g., chronic venous insufficiency), venous valves malfunction and fail to prevent backward flow. Clinically, this can result in painful swelling, varicose veins, edema, and skin ulcerations leading to a chronic wound situation. Surgical correction of venous valves has proven to drastically reduce these symptoms. However, the absence of intact leaflets in many patients limits the applicability of this strategy. In this context, the development of venous valve replacements represents an appealing approach. Despite acceptable results in animal models, no venous valve has succeeded in clinical trials, and so far no single prosthetic venous valve is commercially available. This calls for advanced materials and fabrication approaches to develop clinically relevant venous valves able to restore natural flow conditions in the venous circulation. In this study, we critically discuss the approaches attempted in the last years, and we highlight the potential of tissue engineering to offer new avenues for valve fabrication. Impact statement Venous valves prosthesis offer the potential to restore normal venous flow, and to improve the prospect of patients that suffer from chronic venous disease. Current venous valve replacements are associated with poor outcomes. A deeper understanding of the approaches attempted so far is essential to establish the next steps toward valve development, and importantly, tissue engineering constitutes a unique toolbox to advance in this quest.  
Clinical situations for which 3D printing is considered an appropriate representation or extension of data contained in a medical imaging examination: adult cardiac conditions.  ;"BACKGROUND: Medical 3D printing as a component of care for adults with cardiovascular diseases has expanded dramatically. A writing group composed of the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) Special Interest Group on 3D Printing (SIG) provides appropriateness criteria for adult cardiac 3D printing indications. METHODS: A structured literature search was conducted to identify all relevant articles using 3D printing technology associated with a number of adult cardiac indications, physiologic, and pathologic processes. Each study was vetted by the authors and graded according to published guidelines. RESULTS: Evidence-based appropriateness guidelines are provided for the following areas in adult cardiac care; cardiac fundamentals, perioperative and intraoperative care, coronary disease and ischemic heart disease, complications of myocardial infarction, valve disease, cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac neoplasm, cardiac transplant and mechanical circulatory support, heart failure, preventative cardiology, cardiac and pericardial disease and cardiac trauma. CONCLUSIONS: Adoption of common clinical standards regarding appropriate use, information and material management, and quality control are needed to ensure the greatest possible clinical benefit from 3D printing. This consensus guideline document, created by the members of the RSNA 3D printing Special Interest Group, will provide a reference for clinical standards of 3D printing for adult cardiac indications.

Severe Aortic Stenosis and Chronic Kidney Disease: Outcomes and Impact of Aortic Valve Replacement.  ;"Background The prognostic significance of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in severe aortic stenosis is poorly understood and no studies have yet evaluated the effect of aortic-valve replacement (AVR) versus conservative management on long-term mortality by stage of CKD. Methods and Results We included 4119 patients with severe aortic stenosis. The population was divided into 4 groups according to the baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate: no CKD, mild CKD, moderate CKD, and severe CKD. The 5-year survival rate was 71±1% for patients without CKD, 62±2% for those with mild CKD, 54±3% for those with moderate CKD, and 34±4% for those with severe CKD (P<0.001). By multivariable analysis, patients with moderate or severe CKD had a significantly higher risk of all-cause (hazard ratio [HR] [95% CI]=1.36 [1.08-1.71]; P=0.009 and HR [95% CI]=2.16 [1.67-2.79]; P<0.001, respectively) and cardiovascular mortality (HR [95% CI]=1.39 [1.03-1.88]; P=0.031 and HR [95% CI]=1.69 [1.18-2.41]; P=0.004, respectively) than patients without CKD. Despite more symptoms, AVR was less frequent in moderate (P=0.002) and severe CKD (P<0.001). AVR was associated with a marked reduction in all-cause and cardiovascular mortality versus conservative management for each CKD group (all P<0.001). The joint-test showed no interaction between AVR and CKD stages (P=0.676) indicating a nondifferentialeffect of AVR across stages of CKD. After propensity matching, AVR was still associated with substantially better survival for each CKD stage relative to conservative management (all P<0.0017). Conclusions In severe aortic stenosis, moderate and severe CKD are associated with increased mortality and decreased referral to AVR. AVR markedly reduces all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, regardless of the CKD stage. Therefore, CKD should not discourage physicians from considering AVR.  "

Right ventricular outflow reconstruction with handmade valve conduit - A short experience from a developing country. Case series.  ;OBJECTIVES: Right ventricular outflow tract continuity abnormalities are one of the most commonly encountered entities in the field of congenital cardiac surgery. Various strategies including homograft, valve conduit, Contegra are used to restore continuity between right ventricle and pulmonary artery. In countries like Pakistan these may not be easily available and affordable. We report the experience of our short observational study of using a handmade trileaflet valve conduit to reconstruct the right ventricular outflow tract. METHODOLOGY: From September 2015 to December 2016, a total of 15 patients with different congenital heart diseases underwent open-heart surgery at our institute. Restoration of right ventricular to pulmonary artery continuity was achieved using handmade valve conduit utilizing bovine pericardium and thin sheet PTFE sheets (0.1 mm) as conduit and valve respectively. RESULTS: Patients ranged from 1 to 16 years. Seven patients had previous palliation including 4 blalock taussig (BT) Shunts and 3 pulmonary artery (PA) banding. Postoperative complications were observed in 4 patient including 2 in hospital deaths and 2 required interventions. One patient developed aneurysm at RV- conduit junction requiring surgical repair and the other underwent conduit dilatation for moderate to severe stenosis (gradient 60 mmHg). No significant regurgitation was observed in this series. Overall postoperative gradients were stable with mean gradient 25.3 mmHg (8 mmhg - 60 mmHg). CONCLUSION: The use of handmade valve conduits has acceptable morbidity and mortality. These are cost effective alternatives in this part of the world, where well-established conduits have cost implications and uncertain availability.  
Echocardiographic reference intervals with allometric scaling of 823 clinically healthy rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta).  ;"BACKGROUND: Echocardiography is commonly used for assessing cardiac structure and function in various species including non-human primates. A few previous studies reported normal echocardiographic reference intervals of clinically healthy rhesus macaques under sedation. However, these studies were under-powered, and the techniques were not standardized. In addition, body weight, age, and sex matched reference intervals should be established as echocardiographic measurements are commonly influenced by these variables. The purpose of this study was to establish reference intervals for complete echocardiographic parameters based on a large cohort of clinically healthy rhesus macaques with wide ranges of weight and age distributions using allometric scaling. RESULTS: A total of 823 rhesus macaques (ages 6 months to 31 years old; body weights 1.4 to 22.6 kg) were enrolled. Of these rhesus macaques, 421 were males and 402 were females. They were assessed with a complete echocardiographic examination including structural and functional evaluation under sedation with ketamine hydrochloride. The reference intervals of the key echocardiographic parameters were indexed to weight, age, and sex by calculating the coefficients of the allometric eq. Y = aMb. On correlation matrix, body weight, age, sex, and heart rate were significantly correlated with various echocardiographic parameters and some of the parameters were strongly correlated with body weight and age. Multiple regression analysis revealed that heart rate and body weight statistically significantly predicted several echocardiographic parameters. Valve regurgitation including tricuspid, aortic, pulmonic, and mitral regurgitations without other cardiac structural and functional abnormalities are common in clinically healthy rhesus macaques under ketamine sedation. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the reference intervals of echocardiographic parameters were established by performing complete echocardiographic examinations on a large number of clinical healthy rhesus macaques. In addition, allometric scaling was performed based on their weight, and further indexed to age and sex. These allometrically scaled reference intervals can be used to accurately evaluate echocardiographic data in rhesus macaques and diagnose structural and functional evidence of cardiac disease.  "
YKL-40 (Chitinase-3-Like Protein 1) Serum Levels in Aortic Stenosis.  ;"BACKGROUND: Identification of novel biomarkers could provide prognostic information and improve risk stratification in patients with aortic stenosis (AS). YKL-40 (chitinase-3-like protein 1), a protein involved in atherogenesis, is upregulated in human calcific aortic valves. We hypothesized that circulating YKL-40 would be elevated and associated with the degree of AS severity and outcome in patients with symptomatic AS. METHODS: Plasma YKL-40 was analyzed in 2 AS populations, one severe AS (n=572) with outcome measures and one with mixed severity (n=67). YKL-40 expression in calcified valves and in an experimental pressure overload model was assessed. RESULTS: We found (1) patients with AS had upregulated circulating YKL-40 compared with healthy controls (median 109 versus 34 ng/mL, P<0.001), but levels were not related to the degree of AS severity. (2) High YKL-40 levels (quartile 4) were associated with long-term (median follow-up 4.7 years) all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.93 [95% CI, 1.37-2.73], P<0.001). (3) YKL-40 protein expression in human calcific valves co-localized with its putative receptor IL-13rα2 in close proximity to valve interstitial cells. (4) Myocardial YKL-40 increased in experimental pressure overload (6-fold in decompensated versus sham mice). CONCLUSIONS: YKL-40 levels were elevated in AS and associated with mortality but not with other metrics of disease severity including the degree of AS severity. Despite scientific rationale for its role in AS, the clinical utility of circulating YKL-40 as a biomarker is limited.

[Midterm outcome comparison between patients with bicuspid or tricuspid aortic stenosis undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement].  ;Objective: To compare the prognosis of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in patients with bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) or tricuspid aortic valve (TAV) stenosis. Methods: This was a retrospective study. Patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis, who underwent TAVR with follow-up time more than one year in Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital from April 2016 to August 2018, were included. According to aortic CT angiography, the patients were divided into BAV group and TAV group. The primary endpoint was the composite event of all-cause death and stroke, and the secondary endpoints were TAVR-related complications. Incidence of clinical endpoints and parameters derived from echocardiography were compared between the groups, and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to compare the composite event between the two groups. Results: A total of 49 patients were included. The age was (73.6±6.3) years, and 25(51.0%) were male. There were 32 patients in BAV group and 17 in TAV group, the follow-up time was 466 (390, 664) days. The incidence of composite endpoint of death and stroke at one year were comparable in BAV and TAV groups (6.3% (2/32) vs. 5.9% (1/17), P=1.00). Kaplan-Meier curves also showed a similar risk of the composite endpoint(HR=1.03，95%CI 0.09-11.24，Log-rank P=0.98) between two groups. The incidence of all-cause death, stroke, myocardial infarction, severe bleeding, major vascular complications, new-onset atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, and permanent pacemaker implantation were all similar between the two groups(all P>0.05), and there was no acute kidney injury (stage 2 or 3) in both groups. Echocardiographic parameters at one year were similar between the two groups (all P>0.05). Conclusions: The midterm prognosis of TAVR in patients with BAV and TAV stenosis is similar. Clinical trials of large sample size with long-term follow-up are warranted to verify our findings.  
MicroRNA Profiles in Calcified and Healthy Aorta Differ: Therapeutic Impact of miR-145 and miR-378.  ;"Our goal was to elucidate microRNAs (miRNAs) that may repress the excess bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling observed during pathological calcification in the Klotho mouse model of kidney disease. We hypothesized that restoring healthy levels of miRNAs that post-transcriptionally repress osteogenic calcific factors may decrease aortic calcification. Our relative abundance profiles of miRNAs in healthy aorta differ greatly from those in calcified mouse aorta. Many of these miRNAs are predicted to regulate proteins involved in BMP signaling and may control osteogenesis. Two differentially regulated miRNAs, miR-145 and miR-378, were selected based on three criteria: reduced levels in calcified aorta, the ability to target more than one protein in the BMP signaling pathway, and conservation of targeted sequences between humans and mice. Forced expression using a lentiviral vector demonstrated that restoring normal levels repressed the synthesis of BMP2 and other pro-osteogenic proteins and inhibited pathological aortic calcification in Klotho mice with renal insufficiency. This study identified miRNAs that may impact BMP signaling in both sexes and demonstrated the efficacy of selected miRNAs in reducing aortic calcification in vivo. Calcification of the aorta and the aortic valve resulting from abnormal osteogenesis is common in those with kidney disease, diabetes, and high cholesterol. Such vascular osteogenesis is a clinically significant feature. The calcification modulating miRNAs described here are candidates for biomarkers and ""miRNA replacement therapies"" in the context of chronic kidney disease and other pro-calcific conditions.  "

Degeneration of Bioprosthetic Heart Valves: Update 2020.  ;The implantation of bioprosthetic heart valves (BHVs) is increasingly becoming the treatment of choice in patients requiring heart valve replacement surgery. Unlike mechanical heart valves, BHVs are less thrombogenic and exhibit superior hemodynamic properties. However, BHVs are prone to structural valve degeneration (SVD), an unavoidable condition limiting graft durability. Mechanisms underlying SVD are incompletely understood, and early concepts suggesting the purely degenerative nature of this process are now considered oversimplified. Recent studies implicate the host immune response as a major modality of SVD pathogenesis, manifested by a combination of processes phenocopying the long-term transplant rejection, atherosclerosis, and calcification of native aortic valves. In this review, we summarize and critically analyze relevant studies on (1) SVD triggers and pathogenesis, (2) current approaches to protect BHVs from calcification, (3) obtaining low immunogenic BHV tissue from genetically modified animals, and (4) potential strategies for SVD prevention in the clinical setting.  
Past, current and future management of secondary mitral valve disease: the importance of anatomic staging.  ;DOI: 10.21037/atm.2020.03.82 PMCID: PMC7475447 PMID: 32953768  
Pulmonary regurgitation after repaired tetralogy of Fallot: surgical versus percutaneous treatment.  ;Pulmonary regurgitation is the most important sequellae after correction of Tetralogy of Fallot and has a considerable impact over the right ventricle. Surgery has demonstrated low early mortality after pulmonary valve replacement and good long-term outcomes, remaining nowadays the gold standard treatment of pulmonary regurgitation in rTOF patients. Nevertheless, transcatheter pulmonary valve implantation has emerged as a new, safe and efficient alternative to surgical valve replacement. In this review article, we try to evaluate and compare both techniques to find out which is the best therapeutic option in this patients.  
Tetralogy of Fallot: cardiac imaging evaluation.  ;Thanks to advances in pediatric cardiology, most infants with tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) now survive into adulthood. This relatively new population of adult patients may face long-term complications, including pulmonary regurgitation (PR), right ventricular (RV) tract obstruction, residual shunts, RV dysfunction, and arrythmias. They will often need to undergo pulmonary valve (PV) replacement and other invasive re-interventions. However, the optimal timing for these procedures is challenging, largely due to the complexity of evaluating RV volume and function. The options for the follow-up of these patients have rapidly evolved from an angiography-based approach to the surge of advanced imaging techniques, mainly echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), and computer tomography (CT). In this review, we outline the indications, strengths and limitations of these modalities in the adult TOF population.  
Fusion imaging for transcatheter mitral and tricuspid interventions.  ;Image guidance for transcatheter mitral and tricuspid valve intervention commonly utilizes the unique advantages of both fluoroscopy and live echocardiography. In some cases, pre-procedural computed tomography is also needed. Classically, they are displayed separately even if modalities are in simultaneous use. This requires procedural operators to watch separate images displaying complementary information and mentally combine these data sources. New hybrid, or fusion, imaging systems allow for multiple imaging modalities to be overlaid on one another to provide the most relevant information on a single screen. While this technological advancement may have some advantages in certain procedures, more data is needed to understand if these systems will improve procedural or clinical outcomes.  
Catheter-based treatment of tricuspid regurgitation: state of the art.  ;Tricuspid regurgitation is a highly prevalent condition, with detrimental effects on long-term survival. However, it has been historically neglected, and only surgically addressed when symptomatic diuretic agents proved insufficient to alleviate congestion. Besides, mortality rates of isolated tricuspid regurgitation surgery have been persistently high, even in contemporary series. This has led to the advent of a myriad of transcatheter tricuspid valve interventions mimicking current surgical technologies, for which a comprehensive imaging work-up holds the key for proper patient selection and intraprocedural monitoring. Although initially designed for compassionate use patients, growing experience and encouraging results of these less-invasive technologies are broadening the spectrum of beneficiaries. In this review, we will focus on the current picture of transcatheter tricuspid valve interventions, with special interest on the current understanding of pathoanatomic tricuspid regurgitation progression, preprocedural multimodality imaging and the latest experience on the different transcatheter devices.  
Percutaneous mitral repair: current and future devices.  ;Mitral regurgitation (MR) is the second most common valvular heart disease and its prevalence is increasing with population ageing. In the recent years we have witnessed the development of several transcatheter devices to correct MR in patients at high-risk for surgery. The majority of evidence regarding safety and efficacy of this new therapy comes from MitraClip studies. However, new alternatives on the field of valve repair have emerged with promising results. The aim of this review is to portrait the landscape of transcatheter mitral repair alternatives, from currently used devices to those that will have a role in the near future.  
Outcomes with percutaneous mitral repair vs. optimal medical treatment for functional mitral regurgitation: systematic review.  ;Functional mitral regurgitation (MR) could be defined as a ventricular disease where mitral valve is structurally normal, left chambers are enlarged and mitral annulus is dilated with lack of coaptation of leaflets. Transcatheter mitral valve repair technique has broadened the therapeutic range in the treatment of severe MR. The aim of this study was to review outcomes of MitraClip vs. medical treatment for functional MR. We also planned to review the concept of functional MR, assessment of the degree, prognosis and therapy options. This study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The Medline through PubMed database was used to search. The present review included manuscripts published between January 2009 and September 2019. Two authors independently screened titles and abstracts of all publications, and performed the selection of studies and data extraction. In the case of disagreements, consensus meetings reached the final decision. Inclusion criteria were: (I) randomized controlled trials and (II) works must compare MitraClip versus optimal medical treatment. Transcatheter mitral valve repair along optimal medical treatment has been compared with optimal medical therapy in two different randomized trials. In the COAPT trial, the MitraClip group showed a significant reduction in mortality and heart failure (HF) hospitalizations. In the MITRA-FR trial, no significant differences were observed between both groups. We reviewed important aspects of functional MR and performed a comprehensive review of both trials comparing them and focusing on their differences.  
"Choice of transcatheter heart valve: should we select the device according to each patient's characteristics or should it be ""one valve fits all""?  ";Since its introduction at the beginning of the century, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has implicated a paradigm shift in the treatment of patients with symptomatic aortic valve stenosis. The past years have brought about major improvements of procedural outcomes owing to advances in imaging and patient selection, global experience, and device technology. Whereas in the early stages of TAVR, only two different devices with limited sizes and access options were used, currently a variety of different transcatheter heart valves (THVs) are available. This has expanded the spectrum of patients that can be treated with TAVR and has allowed for sophisticated device selection tailored to the patients' individual anatomy and comorbidities. The big question is whether such a customized device selection is really necessary-or is there one valve type that fits all patients? With this question in mind, the authors provide an overview of contemporary THVs, including technical specifications and clinical data, that help us to understand the potential value of a differential use of THVs.  
Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR): expanding indications to low-risk patients.  ;Aortic stenosis (AS) is the most common cardiac valve disease in developed countries. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) for the treatment of severe symptomatic AS is an accepted therapy option for elderly patients with symptomatic severe AS. Nowadays, TAVR has revolutionized the treatment of AS with an exponential growth worldwide. Both the development of new generation valves and the experience of the operating teams have contributed significantly to decrease the complications rate after TAVR. Several randomized trials have reported similar short- and mid-term results, and even better than surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in patients with high- or intermediate-risk. In addition, two comparison trials in low-risk patients have reported promising results. Therefore, in the future TAVR indications will expand, treating younger and younger patients, with less comorbidities and lower risk. However, the long-term durability of percutaneous prostheses is a matter of debate. The aim of this manuscript is to review available data that support to treat AS in low-risk patients and provide our perspective on the topic.  
Percutaneous treatment with Mitraclip for functional mitral regurgitation: medium-term follow up according to left ventricular function.  ;"BACKGROUND: Functional mitral regurgitation (FMR) is a bad prognosis condition despite optimal medical treatment. Nowadays there is an open debate about the surgical versus percutaneous treatment. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the mid-term follow up clinical outcomes of patients with FMR treated with MitraClip® system, according to their left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). METHODS: Data was obtained from two experienced centers in transcatheter mitral valve repair (TMVR). All consecutive cases of severe FMR undergoing TMVR in both centers with the same inclusion criteria were included prospectively in this study and followed-up. Periodical follow-ups with clinical and echocardiographic evaluation were scheduled from the baseline procedure, at 3 months and then yearly. RESULTS: From October 2015 to October 2019, a total of 119 patients with FMR at 2 centers in Spain underwent TMVR with the MitraClip® procedure and were included in this study. The mean age was 73.8±8.9 years old and 32 patients (26.9%) were female. A 39.5% of cases [47] had a LVEF ≤30% (group 1) and 60.5% (72 cases) had a LVEF >30% (group 2). There was a similar distribution in cardiovascular risk factors, age and other diseases. All MitraClip® implantations were elective and procedural success was achieved in 110 patients (92.4%) with a similar distribution between the groups. There were no differences in procedural time and the number of implanted clips. The median follow-up was 22.6 months (IQR, 11.43-34.98 months). The primary combined endpoint occurred in the 41.6% of the global cohort, 57.5% in group 1 and 30.99% in group 2 (P=0.036). LVEF was associated to the main event in the multivariate analysis (HR 2.09, 95% CI: 1.12-3.89; P=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: The MitraClip edge-to-edge technique is a safe and effective procedure for the treatment of FMR. In this study, patients with LVEF >30% treated with Mitraclip presented better clinical cardiovascular outcomes than those with a LVEF ≤30%. Regardless clinical outcomes, at the end of the follow-up, there was a sustained reduction in MR grades and an important improvement in NYHA functional class.  "
Functional mitral regurgitation: structural modifications with percutaneous valve repair with MitraClip.  ;"BACKGROUND: Mitral regurgitation (MR) is one of the most prevalent valvular diseases in our society. Transcatheter mitral valve repair (TMVR) with the MitraClip® system is increasingly used for treating this condition. The aim of our study is to analyse morphological mitral valve changes related to the procedure and its correlation with the degree of regurgitation at mid-term follow-up and with the combined endpoint of heart failure and all-cause mortality. METHODS: A single-centre, prospective and observational study including consecutive patients admitted between October 2015 and October 2019 for TMVR was designed. The mitral valve annulus (MVA) was analyzed using the three-dimensional MVQ QLAB mitral valve quantification software (Philips; Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Clinical data was collected retrospectively. RESULTS: Eighty-two MitraClip® were implanted. Control echocardiograms showed a significant decrease in the three measures: annular diameters, perimeter and area. Patients with functional MR had greater left ventricular and mitral annular dimensions and experienced greater reductions in anteroposterior diameter and mitral valve area compared with organic MR patients. The anteroposterior diameter reduction (OR 0.90; 95% CI: 0.82-0.99), as well as posterior leaflet grasping (OR 0.94; 95% CI: 0.89-0.99) were associated with the probability of significant MR recurrence. Posterior leaflet grasping and left ventricle ejection fraction were associated with the combined endpoint of heart failure and any cause death. CONCLUSIONS: MitraClip® implantation results in secondary changes in the mitral annular morphology. The magnitude of these morphological changes varies depending on the etiology of the mitral valve regurgitation. Posterior leaflet grasping and anteroposterior diameter reduction after clip are factors associated with relevant clinical and echocardiographic endpoints.  "
Initial experience of a MitraClip valve repair program in Spain.  ;"BACKGROUND: The main objective of this study was to evaluate one-year clinical outcome of patients with symptomatic mitral regurgitation (MR) treated with transcatheter mitral valve repair (TMVR) according to the etiology of MR. METHODS: Data from a single high-volume center of all consecutive cases with symptomatic MR undergoing TMVR where prospectively included and followed. RESULTS: Between October 2015 and October 2019, 81 consecutive patients underwent TMVR and were included in the investigation. The mean age was 75.73±7.81 years, 55 (67.9%) were male. The most frequent mechanism was functional MR (FMR) (59%). The mean EuroSCORE II was 5.7±4.94 [FMR 5.38±3.9, degenerative MR (DMR) 5.72±4.7 and mixed MR (MMR) 6.6±7.5; P=0.7776] and STS score mean was 5.21±3.31 (FMR 4.6±2.3, DMR 6.43±5.2 and MMR 5.7±3.2; P=0.126). Patients with FMR had higher rates of dilated (36 patients, 75.5%) and ischemic (15 patients, 31.3%) cardiomyopathy, as well as worse left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Procedural success was achieved in 72 (88.9%) patients, with a similar distribution between groups. The median of follow-up was 16.3 months. The primary combined endpoint occurred in 19 (23.5%) cases. The number of the combined event regarding the different etiologies were 15 (31.2%) in FMR, 2 (11.8%) in DMR and 5 (31.3%) in MMR (P=0.276). Sixteen patients (20.0%) died during the first year of follow-up and 19 (23.5%) had unplanned heart failure (HF) hospitalization. Previous surgical revascularization (HR =4.94, P=0.004) and a redo TMVR (HR =11.3, P=0.006) predicted the main event. CONCLUSIONS: TMVR with the Mitraclip device is safe, with a low incidence of complications and a high rate of procedural success. One-year outcomes show reduction of all cause death and HF admissions. Moreover, most of the patients have sustained MR reduction and an improvement in the functional class at the end of follow-up.

Ventricular arrhythmias in patients with functional mitral regurgitation and implantable cardiac devices: implications of mitral valve repair with Mitraclip(®).  ;BACKGROUND: Limited information has been reported regarding the impact of percutaneous mitral valve repair (PMVR) on ventricular arrhythmic (VA) burden. The aim of this study was to address the incidence of VA and appropriate antitachycardia implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD) therapies before and after PMVR. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed all consecutive patients with heart failure with reduce left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), functional mitral regurgitation (FMR) grade 3+ or 4+ and an active ICD or cardiac resynchronizer who underwent PMVR in any of the eleven recruiting centers. Only patients with complete available device VA monitoring from one-year before to one year after PMVR were included. Baseline clinical and echocardiographic characteristics were collected before PMVR and at 12-months follow-up. RESULTS: Ninety-three patients (68.2±10.9 years old, male 88.2%) were enrolled. PMVR was successfully performed in all patients and device success at discharge was 91.4%. At 12-month follow-up, we observed a significant reduction in mitral regurgitation severity, NT-proBNP and prevalence of severe pulmonary hypertension and severe kidney disease. Patients also referred a significant improvement in NYHA functional class and showed a non-significant trend to reserve left ventricular remodeling. After PMVR a significant decrease in the incidence of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) (5.0±17.8 vs. 2.7±13.5, P=0.002), sustained VT or ventricular fibrillation (0.9±2.5 vs. 0.5±2.9, P=0.012) and ICD antitachycardia therapies (2.5±12.0 vs. 0.9±5.0, P=0.033) were observed. CONCLUSIONS: PMVR was related to a reduction in arrhythmic burden and ICD therapies in our cohort.  
Long term follow up of percutaneous treatment for degenerated Mitroflow prosthesis with self-expanding transcatheter aortic valve implantation.  ;"BACKGROUND: The durability of aortic valve bioprosthesis and the structural valve deterioration (SVD) are could be treated with valve-in-valve (VIV) transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). This technique has been proven to be a feasible procedure with good results in selected patients. The aim of this work was to assess the long-term results of this TAVI with an autoexpandable valve in patients with failed Mitroflow (MF) bioprosthetic aortic valves. METHODS: Single center, observational and prospective study that included 65 consecutive patients with symptomatic failed MF bioprosthetic aortic valve, treated with VIV-TAVI. The primary endpoints were clinical long-term events including all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, re-hospitalization due to heart failure, stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA) and endocarditis. Secondary endpoints were the absence of SVD or patient-prosthesis mismatch (PPM) and valve hemodynamics analysis at follow-up. RESULTS: Between March 2012 to July 2019, 65 symptomatic patients (age 80.4±5.9 years) with degenerated MF valves (numbers 19: 27.7%; 21: 38.5%; 23: 21.5%; 25: 12.3%) underwent CoreValve (n=11) or Evolut R (n=54) implantation (23, 26 and 29 mm sizes). The STS predicted risk of mortality was 6.39%±5.62%. The primary combined endpoint occurred in 32.3% of the cases. A total of 13 patients (20%) died during follow-up, but 4 (7.3%) from cardiovascular causes. Two patients were reported of having a stroke/TIA and 5 readmissions for cardiovascular causes were reported (2 of them within the first 30 days). Twenty-five patients (38.5%) presented PPM during follow-up, being PPM severe in 15 (23.1%). CONCLUSIONS: Self-expanding TAVI for degenerated MF bioprosthesis has favourable long-term outcomes. It is a good option in order to avoid the risks of redo surgery in selected patients.  "
Right ventricular outflow tract stenting during neonatal and infancy periods: A multi-center, retrospective study.  ;"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of right ventricular outflow tract stenting for palliation during the newborn and infancy periods. METHODS: Between January 2013 and January 2018, a total of 38 patients (20 males, 18 females; median age 51 days; range, 3 days to 9 months) who underwent transcatheter right ventricular outflow tract stenting in three centers were retrospectively analyzed. Demographic characteristics, cardiac pathologies, angiographic procedural, and clinical follow-up data of the patients were recorded. RESULTS: The diagnoses of the cases were tetralogy of Fallot (n=27), double outlet right ventricle (n=8), complex congenital heart disease (n=2), and Ebstein""s anomaly (n=1). The median weight at the time of stent implantation was 3.5 (range, 2 to 10) kg. Five cases had genetic abnormalities. The median pre-procedural oxygen saturation was 63% (range, 44 to 80%), and the median procedural time was 60 (range, 25 to 120) min. Acute procedural success ratio was 87%. Reintervention was needed in seven of patients due to stent narrowing during follow-up. During follow-up period, seven cases died. Total correction surgery was performed in 26 patients without any mortality. While a transannular patch was used in 22 patients, valve protective surgery was implemented in two patients, and the bidirectional Glenn procedure was performed in two patients. CONCLUSION: Based on our study results, right ventricular outflow tract stenting is a form of palliation which should be considered particularly in cases in whom total correction surgery is unable to be performed due to morbidity.

Efficacy of left atrial plication for atrial functional mitral regurgitation.  ;"OBJECTIVE: Atrial functional mitral regurgitation (AFMR) is caused by atrial fibrillation and left atrial enlargement. Our study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of left atrial plication (LAP) for AFMR. METHODS: Of 1164 mitral valve surgery patients at our hospital from January 2000 to May 2019, 22 patients underwent surgery for AFMR. Our retrospective analysis divided the patients with AFMR into two groups according to whether LAP was performed (LAP + group, n = 9; LAP - group, n = 13). Mitral valve angle (MV angle) (horizontal inclination of mitral valve) was measured by pre- and post-operative computed tomography scan. Individuals with type II mitral regurgitation, left ventricular ejection fraction of < 55%, males with left ventricular endo-diastolic dimension of > 60 mm and females with > 55 mm, aortic valve disease, mitral valve calcification, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, and both ""redo"" and emergency cases were excluded. RESULT: Mitral valve replacement was performed in 6 patients and mitral ring annuloplasty in 16 cases. No recurrence of mitral regurgitation or structural valve deterioration occurred during the follow-up period. There were no hospital deaths; 3 deaths occurred during the follow-up period. Compared to the LAP - group, the LAP + group demonstrated a significantly greater decrease of MV angle (16.6 ± 8.1° vs. 1.2 ± 6.9°, p < 0.01) and left atrial dimension (18.4 ± 7.0 mm vs. 6.9 ± 14.6 mm, p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Surgical results of AFMR were satisfactory. LAP may be appropriate for correcting the angle of a mitral valve tilted horizontally. More cases need to be considered in the future.  "
Pre-procedural pacing bias among transcatheter aortic valves with higher post-procedure pacing rates: evidence from the UK TAVI Registry.  ;"Rates of permanent pacemaker (PPM) implantation following transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) are higher than following surgery and are dependent on patient factors and valve type. There is an increasing trend towards pre-emptive PPM insertion in patients with significant conduction disease prior to TAVI. We report results from the British Cardiovascular Intervention Society (BCIS) on pre- and post-procedural PPM implantation in the TAVI population. All centres in the United Kingdom performing TAVI are required to submit data on all TAVI procedures to the National database which are then reported annually. During 2015, there were 2373 TAVI procedures in the UK. 22.4% of TAVI patients had a PPM implanted either pre-procedure (including the distant past), or during the in-hospital procedural episode. Of these, 7.9% were pre-procedure and 14.5% post-procedure. Overall PPM rates were Edwards Sapien (13.5%), Medtronic CoreValve (28.2%) and Boston Lotus (42.1%; p < 0.01). Pre-procedure pacing rates were Edwards Sapien (6.0%), Medtronic CoreValve (9.1%) and Boston Lotus (12.3%; p < 0.01). Pre-procedural pacing rates for the Boston Lotus valve have risen year-on-year from 5.8% (2013) to 8.6% (2014) to 12.3% (2015). The UK TAVI Registry demonstrates a pre-procedural permanent pacing bias amongst patients receiving transcatheter valves with higher post-procedure pacing rates. Pre-emptive permanent pacing is likely to be responsible for this difference.  "
Correlation Between Plasma Matrix Metalloproteinase-28 Levels and Severity of Calcific Aortic Valve Stenosis.  ;BACKGROUND Calcific aortic valve disease is a common cardiovascular disorder worldwide. This study aimed to investigate the correlation between plasma matrix metalloproteinase-28 (MMP-28) levels and the severity of calcific aortic valve stenosis. MATERIAL AND METHODS Calcific aortic valve stenosis patients who were admitted to the heart center of our hospital between January 2016 and January 2019 to undergo surgery were successively enrolled in this study (55 males and 24 females with an average age of 58.5±9.6). Information on echocardiography, plasma MMP-28 levels, and other clinical data of the patients was retrospectively collected. RESULTS The average plasma MMP-28 level was 2.43±2.22 ng/mL (range, 0.22-8.27 ng/mL). Plasma MMP-28 levels in patients with mild (n=24), moderate (n=31), or severe (n=24) aortic valve stenosis were 0.74 (0.25-2.23), 1.46 (0.50-3.22), and 4.13 (1.54-6.18) ng/mL, respectively, indicating that the patients with severe aortic valve stenosis had significantly higher MMP-28 levels than the patients with moderate or mild aortic valve stenosis (both P<0.01). Regression analysis using the general linear model further revealed that plasma MMP-28 level was correlated with the peak blood flow velocity and mean pressure gradient of the transaortic valve, and the correlations were statistically significant (both P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS MMP-28 level is significantly elevated in severe cases of calcific aortic valve stenosis. Moreover, plasma MMP-28 levels are positively correlated with the mean pressure gradients and peak blood flow velocity of the transaortic valve.  
The role of endocarditis in sudden cardiac death: highlighting the value of the autopsy, pathological features and cardiac complications.  ;"OBJECTIVE: Endocarditis is increasing in incidence due to growing numbers of cardiac interventions, valve replacements and immunosuppressants. It can be difficult to diagnose clinically, has high mortality and can present as sudden cardiac death (SCD) with few/subtle preceding symptoms. True incidence of SCD related to endocarditis is unknown. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of UK national database of 6000 cases of SCD, 1994-2020, for ""endocarditis"" as cause of death. RESULTS: Of 30 cases (0.50%), 19(63%) were male and mean age was 36.2 ± 20.1 years. Postmortem examination showed the aortic valve was solely affected in 13 (43%), mitral in 9 (30%), tricuspid in 2(6.7%) and pulmonary in 1 (3.3%). Three cases (10%) had more than one valve affected and 2 (6.7%) were nonvalvular affecting the ascending aorta. Vegetations ranged from small easily missed irregularities to large fungating masses. Ten (33%) patients developed aortic abscesses, 2 of which had aneurysms, 13 (43%) had coronary artery septic emboli with micro-abscesses and myocardial microinfarction, and 2 (6.7%) were healed endocarditis with perforation and regurgitation with ventricular remodeling. Thirteen (43%) had an identifiable underlying valve abnormality or replacement, most common being a bicuspid aortic valve (7; 54%). CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights that although rare, endocarditis is an important cause of SCD in those with normal valves, valvular disease and valve replacement surgery. Absence of a premortem diagnosis in 70% of our cohort highlights the need for detailed analysis of the heart and cardiac valves at autopsy. Gross appearance of vegetations varies widely and can be missed. Awareness of associated cardiac complications is required for elucidation of the cause of death and will provide valuable lessons for clinicians.  "
Cachexia, muscle wasting, and frailty in cardiovascular disease.  ;The last several years have seen increasing interest in understanding cachexia, muscle wasting, and physical frailty across the broad spectrum of patients with cardiovascular illnesses. This interest originally started in the field of heart failure, but has recently been extended to other areas such as atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, peripheral artery disease as well as to patients after cardiac surgery or transcatheter aortic valve implantation. Tissue wasting and frailty are prevalent among many of the affected patients. The ageing process itself and concomitant cardiovascular illness decrease lean mass while fat mass is relatively preserved, making elderly patients particularly prone to develop wasting syndromes and frailty. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the available knowledge of body wasting and physical frailty in patients with cardiovascular illness, particularly focussing on patients with heart failure in whom most of the available data have been gathered. In addition, mechanisms of wasting and possible therapeutic targets are discussed.  
When should a rare inherited connective tissue disorder be suspected in bicuspid aortic valve by primary-care internists and cardiologists? Proposal of a score.  ;Size threshold for aortic surgery in bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is debated. Connective tissue disorders (CTDs) are claimed as a clinical turning point, suggesting early surgery in BAV patients with CTD. Thus, we aimed at developing a score to detect high risk of carrying CTDs in consecutive BAVs from primary care. Ninety-eight BAVs without ectopia lentis or personal/family history of aortic dissection were studied at the Marfan syndrome Tuscany Referral Center. Findings were compared with those detected in 84 Marfan patients matched for sex and age. We selected traits with high statistical difference between MFS and BAV easily obtainable by cardiologists and primary-care internists: mitral valve prolapse, myopia ≥ 3DO, pectus carenatum, pes planus, wrist and thumb signs, and difference between aortic size at root and ascending aorta ≥ 4 mm. Clustering of ≥ 3 of these manifestations were more frequent in Marfan patients than in BAVs (71.4% vs 6.1%, p < 0.0001) resulting into an Odds Ratio to be affected by MFS of 38.3 (95% confidence intervals 14.8-99.3, p < 0.0001). We propose a score assembling simple clinical and echocardiographic variables resulting in an appropriate referral pattern of BAVs from a primary-care setting to a tertiary center to evaluate the presence of a potential, major CTD.  
Balloon aortic valvuloplasty for urgent treatment of severe aortic stenosis during coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic: a case report.  ;"An 86-year-old man affected by severe aortic stenosis (AS) was referred to our institution owing to decompensated heart failure. Three months before, the patient was scheduled for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), which was postponed owing to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. Owing to COVID-19 suspicion, he underwent nasopharyngeal swab and was temporarily isolated. However, the rapid deterioration of clinical and haemodynamic conditions prompted us to perform balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV) as bridge to TAVI. The patient's haemodynamics improved; and the next day, the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction for COVID-19 was negative. At Day 5, he underwent TAVI procedure. Subsequent clinical course was uneventful. During COVID-19 pandemic, the deferral of TAVI procedure should be assessed on a case-by-case basis to avoid delay in patients at high risk for adverse events. BAV may be an option when TAVI is temporarily contraindicated such as in AS patients suspected for COVID-19.  "
Relationships between mitral annular calcification and cardiovascular events: A meta-analysis.  ;BACKGROUND: Mitral annular calcification (MAC) is prevalent in the aging population, with recent renewed interest regarding its associations with cardiovascular risk factors, outcomes, and influence on valvular heart disease and interventions. This meta-analysis aimed to report the relationships between MAC and cardiovascular mortality and morbidity events. METHODS: Relevant studies were searched from PubMed, Cochrane, and Embase databases until November 30, 2019. Associations between MAC as a binary variable with death and cardiovascular events were pooled using random-effects models. The main outcomes of interest were all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and procedural outcomes. RESULTS: Among 799 article abstracts and 122 full-text articles screened, 26 (16 prospective and 10 retrospective) studies totaling 35 070 subjects were analyzed. MAC was associated with higher all-cause death, hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) 1.76 (1.43-2.22), and cardiovascular mortality 1.85 (1.45-23.5). It also positively correlated with myocardial infarction 1.48 (1.22-1.79), stroke 1.51 (1.22-2.05), incidental heart failure 1.55 (1.30-1.84), atrial fibrillation 1.75 (1.43-2.15), and their composite, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Finally, conversion to mitral valve replacement at time of cardiac surgery was more in patients with MAC than without MAC, with odds ratio (95% confidence interval) 2.82 (1.28-6.18). CONCLUSION: Mitral annular calcification was overall associated with higher rates of death, and both individual and composite cardiovascular events. The presence of increasingly encountered MAC has significant clinical implications for cardiovascular risk assessment and valvular interventions.  
TAVI imaging: over the echocardiography.  ;Aortic valve stenosis (AS) is a common valvular heart disease. Recently, transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has changed the treatment of severe AS in elderly patients with contraindications to traditional surgical replacement. Echocardiography is conventionally used as the first imaging modality to assess the presence and severity of AS and to provide anatomical and functional information. Nowadays, imaging techniques play a crucial role in the planning of TAVI to define suitable candidates. Computed tomography (CT) is essential to display the anatomy of the aortic valve complex (including aortic annulus, Valsalva sinuses, coronary arteries ostia, sinotubular junction), thoracoabdominal aorta, and vascular access. Cardiac CT may also provide the evaluation of coronary arteries in alternative to conventional coronary angiography. Magnetic resonance imaging may be alternative or supplementary in selected cases, providing detailed information of cardiac function and myocardial wall characteristics. More recently, advanced computer modeling image-based techniques can be used to support the evaluation of the feasibility and safety of TAVI procedures.  
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in a cat owned by a COVID-19-affected patient in Spain.  ;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of COVID-19, is considered a zoonotic pathogen mainly transmitted human to human. Few reports indicate that pets may be exposed to the virus. The present report describes a cat suffering from severe respiratory distress and thrombocytopenia living with a family with several members affected by COVID-19. Clinical signs of the cat prompted humanitarian euthanasia and a detailed postmortem investigation to assess whether a COVID-19-like disease was causing the condition. Necropsy results showed the animal suffered from feline hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and severe pulmonary edema and thrombosis. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was only detected in nasal swab, nasal turbinates, and mesenteric lymph node, but no evidence of histopathological lesions compatible with a viral infection were detected. The cat seroconverted against SARS-CoV-2, further evidencing a productive infection in this animal. We conclude that the animal had a subclinical SARS-CoV-2 infection concomitant to an unrelated cardiomyopathy that led to euthanasia.  
Clinical performance of decellularized heart valves versus standard tissue conduits: a systematic review and meta-analysis.  ;"BACKGROUND: Valve replacement surgery is the definitive management strategy for patients with severe valvular disease. However, valvular conduits currently in clinical use are associated with significant limitations. Tissue-engineered (decellularized) heart valves are alternative prostheses that have demonstrated promising early results. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to perform robust evaluation of the clinical performance of decellularized heart valves implanted in either outflow tract position, in comparison with standard tissue conduits. METHODS: Systematic searches were conducted in the PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases for articles in which outcomes between decellularized heart valves surgically implanted within either outflow tract position of human subjects and standard tissue conduits were compared. Primary endpoints included postoperative mortality and reoperation rates. Meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model via the Mantel-Haenszel method. RESULTS: Seventeen articles were identified, of which 16 were included in the meta-analysis. In total, 1418 patients underwent outflow tract reconstructions with decellularized heart valves and 2725 patients received standard tissue conduits. Decellularized heart valves were produced from human pulmonary valves and implanted within the right ventricular outflow tract in all cases. Lower postoperative mortality (4.7% vs. 6.1%; RR 0.94, 95% CI: 0.60-1.47; P = 0.77) and reoperation rates (4.8% vs. 7.4%; RR 0.55, 95% CI: 0.36-0.84; P = 0.0057) were observed in patients with decellularized heart valves, although only reoperation rates were statistically significant. There was no statistically significant heterogeneity between the analyzed articles (I2 = 31%, P = 0.13 and I2 = 33%, P = 0.10 respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Decellularized heart valves implanted within the right ventricular outflow tract have demonstrated significantly lower reoperation rates when compared to standard tissue conduits. However, in order to allow for more accurate conclusions about the clinical performance of decellularized heart valves to be made, there need to be more high-quality studies with greater consistency in the reporting of clinical outcomes.

Interobserver agreement of the anatomic and physiological classification system for adult congenital heart disease.  ;"The Anatomic and Physiological (AP) classification system proposed in the 2018 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) guidelines assigns 2 dimensions to each patient: anatomic class (AnatC) and physiological stage (PhyS). This approach has not been tested in practice; we assessed interrater reliability and identified sources of disagreement. METHODS: Consensus definitions for AP categories were developed with input from 4 experts. Research assistants (RAs) assigned AnatC/PhyS for patients in the Boston ACHD Biobank, a prospectively enrolled cohort of ambulatory ACHD patients ≥18 years old seen between 2012 and 2019. Two (of 4) expert reviewers then independently assigned AnatC/PhyS for 41 patients. Interrater reliability was assessed with linearly weighted kappa (κω) for agreement between (1) experts and (2) an RA and an expert. Experts examined disagreements and identified sources of variability and areas requiring clarification. RESULTS: Interexpert agreement for AnatC was excellent, with agreement on 38/41 (92.7%) cases and κω 0.88 [0.75, 1.01]. Agreement for PhyS was less robust, with consensus on 24/41 cases (59.5%), κω 0.57 [0.39, 0.75]. Expert-RA agreement was lower for AnatC (κω 0.77 [0.60, 0.95]), whereas PhyS was similar to interexpert agreement (κω 0.53 [0.34, 0.72]). There was ambiguity in the definitions of (1) arrhythmia status, (2) cyanotic CHD, and (3) valve disease. CONCLUSIONS: Although AnatC can be assessed reliably, that is not true for the PhyS part of the AP classification proposed in the 2018 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines. Reliability of PhyS would be strengthened by more precise definitions readily interpretable in clinical practice.  "
Preoperative myocardial expression of E3 ubiquitin ligases in aortic stenosis patients undergoing valve replacement and their association to postoperative hypertrophy.  ;Currently, aortic valve replacement is the only treatment capable of relieving left ventricle pressure overload in patients with severe aortic stenosis. It aims to improve cardiac function and revert hypertrophy, by triggering myocardial reverse remodeling. Despite immediately relieving afterload, reverse remodeling turns out to be extremely variable. Among other factors, the extent of reverse remodeling may depend on how well ubiquitin-proteasome system tackle hypertrophy. Therefore, we assessed tagged ubiquitin and ubiquitin ligases in the left ventricle collected from patients undergoing valve replacement and tested their association to the degree of reverse remodeling. Patients were classified according to the regression of left ventricle mass (ΔLVM) and assigned to complete (ΔLVM≥15%) or incomplete (ΔLVM≤5%) reverse remodeling groups. No direct inter-group differences were observed. Nevertheless, correlation analysis supports a fundamental role of the ubiquitin-proteasome system during reverse remodeling. Indeed, total protein ubiquitination was associated to hypertrophic indexes such as interventricular septal thickness (r = 0.55, p = 0.03) and posterior wall thickness (r = 0.65, p = 0.009). No significant correlations were observed for Muscle Ring Finger 3. Surprisingly, though, higher levels of atrogin-1 were associated to postoperative interventricular septal thickness (r = 0.71, p = 0.005). In turn, Muscle Ring Finger 1 correlated negatively with this postoperative hypertrophy marker (r = -0.68, p = 0.005), suggesting a cardioprotective role during reverse remodeling. No significant correlations were found with left ventricle mass regression, although a trend for a negative association between the ligase Murine Double Minute 2 and mass regression (r = -0.44, p = 0.10) was found. Animal studies will be necessary to understand whether this ligase is protective or detrimental. Herein, we show, for the first time, an association between the preoperative myocardial levels of ubiquitin ligases and postoperative hypertrophy, highlighting the therapeutic potential of targeting ubiquitin ligases in incomplete reverse remodeling.

Efficacy of adding ramipril (VAsotop) to the combination of furosemide (Lasix) and pimobendan (VEtmedin) in dogs with mitral valve degeneration: The VALVE trial.  ;"BACKGROUND: Triple therapy (TT) consisting of furosemide, pimobendan, and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) frequently is recommended for the treatment of congestive heart failure (CHF) attributable to myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD). However, the effect of adding an ACEI to the combination of pimobendan and furosemide (dual therapy [DT]) so far has not been evaluated prospectively. HYPOTHESIS: Triple therapy will extend survival time compared to DT in dogs with CHF secondary to MMVD. ANIMALS: Client-owned dogs presented with the first episode of CHF caused by MMVD. METHODS: Prospective, single-blinded, randomized multicenter study. One-hundred and fifty-eight dogs were recruited and prospectively randomized to receive either DT (furosemide and pimobendan) or TT (furosemide, pimobendan, and ramipril). The primary endpoint was a composite of cardiac death, euthanasia for heart failure, or treatment failure. RESULTS: Seventy-seven dogs were randomized to receive DT and 79 to receive TT. Two dogs were excluded from analysis. The primary endpoint was reached by 136 dogs (87%; 66 dogs, DT; 70 dogs, TT). Median time to reach the primary endpoint for all dogs in the study was 214 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 168-259 days). Median time to reach the primary endpoint was not significantly different between the DT group (227 days; interquartile range [IQR], 103-636 days) compared with TT group (186 days; IQR, 72-453 days; P = .42). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Addition of the ACEI ramipril to pimobendan and furosemide did not have any beneficial effect on survival time in dogs with CHF secondary to MMVD.  "
Ozaki procedure complicated by postpericardiotomy syndrome and cardiac tamponade.  ;Aortic valve replacement has long been the standard of care for many aortic valve diseases. Neo sinus reconstruction and aortic valve reconstruction with native pericardium, known as the Ozaki procedure, is a relatively new technique with early studies showing good mid-term durability and hemodynamics without the need for life-long anticoagulation. We present the case of a 56-year-old male presenting with aortic valve endocarditis and severe aortic insufficiency who underwent successful aortic valve reconstruction via the Ozaki procedure complicated by postpericardiotomy syndrome and cardiac tamponade. Although the Ozaki procedure is a promising alternative to conventional aortic valve replacement, further study is needed to determine long-term re-operation rates, stability and mortality.  
Edge-to-edge tricuspid valve repair for severe tricuspid regurgitation 20 years after cardiac transplantation.  ;Tricuspid valve regurgitation in orthotopic heart transplant recipients is common. Surgical corrections have been the mainstay of the treatment for diuretic-refractory heart failure due to severe tricuspid regurgitation. However, post-transplant patients inherently carry higher surgical risk owing to previous sternotomy and immunocompromised state. We report a case of successful percutaneous edge-to-edge tricuspid valve repair for severe tricuspid regurgitation after cardiac transplantation. A 27-year-old man with a history of idiopathic restrictive cardiomyopathy status after orthotopic heart transplant presented with severe right-sided heart failure symptoms. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed bi-atrial enlargement and moderate-to-severe tricuspid regurgitation, and an increase to the severe range with exercise. Percutaneous edge-to-edge tricuspid valve repair was performed. The patient's symptoms improved, and follow-up echocardiogram showed mild tricuspid regurgitation. Percutaneous tricuspid valve repair can be considered as an alternative option to conventional surgery for symptomatic severe tricuspid regurgitation in orthotopic heart transplant recipients with suitable anatomy.  
Long-term outcomes after reoperation for mitral paravalvular leaks: a single-centre experience.  ;"OBJECTIVES: We aimed to analyse the pathology of paravalvular leak (PVL), and determine the long-term outcomes of redo mitral valve replacement and risk factors of all-cause mortality. METHODS: Seventy-nine patients (mean age 70 ± 9 years; 54 female, 68%) who underwent redo mitral valve replacement for mitral PVL between January 2000 and May 2019 were retrospectively reviewed. Indications for PVL intervention were haemolytic anaemia (57/79, 72%), New York Heart Association class III/IV congestive heart failure (56/79, 71%) and prosthetic valve endocarditis with PVL (2/79, 3%). RESULTS: PVL most commonly occurred at lateral sectors (42/79, 55%). Early mortality occurred in 2 patients (3%) due to low cardiac output syndrome. Two patients (3%) had residual PVL at discharge. Sixteen patients (23%) developed late PVL (mean follow-up, 3.4 ± 2.9 years), among whom 11 (69%) developed PVL at same area as that preoperatively. Additionally, 9 patients (56%) developed PVL at lateral sectors in late follow-up. At 1, 5 and 10 years, the survival rate was 93%, 72% and 45%; rate of freedom from cardiac death was 96%, 92% and 78%; and rate of freedom from PVL recurrence was 94%, 82% and 54%, respectively. Chronic kidney disease was the only risk factor in the multivariate analysis for mortality [P = 0.013; hazard ratio 4.0 (1.4-11.0)]. CONCLUSIONS: Surgery for mitral PVL confers reasonable early and long-term outcomes. Greater attention to the anterolateral annulus may help prevent PVL.  "
del Nido cardioplegia in surgery for aortic root disease: a historically controlled study.  ;BACKGROUND: To determine the safely and effectively of del Nido cardioplegia (DNC) in surgery for aortic root disease, with mild hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). METHODS: From July to December 2017, all patients undergoing the surgery for aortic root disease (total aortic root replacement, valve-sparing aortic root replacement and replacement of aortic valve plus ascending aorta), with mild hypothermic CPB, were retrospectively reviewed at our institution. Patients were divided into two groups based on the type of cardioplegia: the classical blood cardioplegia (CBC group) and del Nido cardioplegia (DNC group). Demographics, operative details, perioperative data and postoperative complications were recorded and compared. A propensity score matching was performed in this study. RESULTS: The preoperative data in DNC group were similar to CBC group. The volume of ultrafiltration was lower in DNC than CBC group (2,053.49±806.62 DNC vs. 2,666.00±967.14 CBC, P=0.001), when matched. The use of temporary pacemaker was more in DNC group (n=20, 46.5%, P=0.023), and the rate of automatic heart resuscitating was higher in the CBC group (92.0% vs. 72.1% DNC group, P=0.024, unmatched).There were no differences in in-hospital mortality, troponin T (mean 0.66 ng/mL for CBC group vs. 0.49 ng/mL for DNC group, P=0.152), left ventricular ejection fraction (mean 58.37% for CBC group vs. 60.07% for DNC group, P=0.395) or other postoperative complications between two groups, after matching. In subgroup analysis, the ultrafiltration volume was lower in DNC than CBC group (1,932.26±749.39 DNC vs. 2,640.00±996.24 CBC, P=0.004), when ACC time less than or equal to 90 minutes. The apache score was better in DNC group (4.75±3.41, P=0.041), when ACC time greater than 90 min. There were no statistical significances in other characteristics between groups. CONCLUSIONS: DNC is safe and effective for surgery for aortic root disease, not inferior to the CBC.  
Impact of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement on Severity of Chronic Kidney Disease.  ;BACKGROUND: The effect of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) on kidney function stage in patients with aortic stenosis remains poorly understood. We hypothesized that in some patients, TAVR results in improved kidney function by alleviating cardiorenal syndrome. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to assess change in chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage following TAVR, identify variables associated with pre- and post-TAVR estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and assess association of post-TAVR eGFR with mortality. METHODS: Patients (n = 5,190) receiving TAVR in the PARTNER (Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valves) 1, 2, and PARTNER 2 S3 trials between April 2007 and October 2014 were included. Pre-TAVR and procedural variables associated with post-TAVR eGFR, change in CKD stage at ≤7 days post-TAVR, and association of post-TAVR eGFR on intermediate-term mortality were assessed. RESULTS: At baseline, CKD stage ≥2 was present in 91% of patients. CKD stage either improved or was unchanged following TAVR in the majority of patients (77% stage 1, 90% stage 2, 89% stage 3A, 94% stage 3B, and 99% stage 4). Progression to CKD stage 5 occurred in 1 (0.035%) of 2,892 patients within 7 days post-TAVR. Of 3,546 patients in whom data were available, 70 (2.0%) underwent post-TAVR dialysis. Higher pre-TAVR eGFR and transfemoral approach were strongly associated with higher post-TAVR eGFR. Lower baseline and longitudinal post-TAVR eGFR were associated with lower intermediate-term survival. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing TAVR, even with baseline impaired eGFR, CKD stage is more likely to stay the same or improve than worsen. Aortic stenosis may contribute to cardiorenal syndrome that improves with TAVR.  
Relevance of Functional Mitral Regurgitation in Aortic Valve Stenosis.  ;"The clinical relevance of functional-mitral-regurgitation (FMR) in patients with aortic valve stenosis (AS) has been poorly studied using a quantitative approach. In addition, FMR prognostic value has mostly been analyzed after aortic valve replacement. Between 2010 and 2014 the echocardiograms of consecutive AS patients were retrospectively reviewed. Inclusion criteria were calcified aortic valve with transaortic-velocity >2.5 m/s and calculated mitral effective regurgitant orifice area (ERO) in the presence of mitral regurgitation. Organic mitral valve disease was an exclusion-criteria. Primary endpoint was heart failure or death under medical management. Secondary endpoint was heart failure or death. Eligible patients were 189, age 79 ± 8 years, 61% NYHA I/II, indexed aortic valve area (AVA) 0.55 ± 0.17 cm2/m2. Mitral ERO was 7.6 ± 4.2 mm2 (>10 mm2 in 30% of patients). Longitudinal function (by S'-TDI) was associated with mitral ERO independently of ejection fraction and ventricular volumes (p = 0.01). Mitral ERO greater than 10 mm2 (threshold identified by spline survival-modeling) was associated with severe symptoms (Odds ratio [OR] 3.1 [1.6 to 6.0]; p = 0.0006) and higher pulmonary-arterial-pressure (OR 3.0 [1.4 to 5.9]; p = 0.002). Follow-up was completed for 175 patients. After 4.7 [1.4 to 7.2] years, 87 (50%) patients underwent AVR, 66 (38%) had heart-failure, 64 (37%) died. No procedure on FMR was required. Mitral ERO was independently associated with primary and secondary endpoints both as continuous variable (Hazard ratio [HR] 1.15 [1.00 to 1.30]; p = 0.04 and HR 1.23 [1.05 to 1.43]; p = 0.01 per 5 mm2 ERO increase) or as ERO> versus ≤10 mm2. Adjustment for S'-TDI or subgroup-analysis did not affect results. The analysis by AVA revealed the incremental prognostic role of mitral ERO over AS severity. In conclusion, AS patients with concomitant FMR >10 mm2 holds a higher risk during medical follow-up. FMR quantitation, even for volumetrically modest regurgitation, provides incremental prognostic information over AS severity.  "

Late onset complete heart block after transcatheter aortic valve replacement treated with permanent His-bundle pacing.  ;Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a rapidly growing procedure. Conduction disease post-TAVR is frequent and routinely monitored for periprocedurally. Permanent pacemaker placement is relatively common and usually associated with worse outcomes post-TAVR. We report a case of very late presenting complete heart block post-TAVR treated with His-bundle pacing. Our case underscores the need for larger studies to further evaluate the utility of long-term cardiac monitoring post-TAVR and outcomes of His-bundle pacing in this population.

Preparation, escalation, de-escalation, and normal activities.  ;Iran is one of the earliest countries involved with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. In the present short report, we have presented our experiences as a cardiovascular tertiary center during the COVID-19 outbreak. At the beginning, we have pursued our activities in four field of administrative, preventative, therapeutic, and research. Then by gaining new experiences, we have tailored our strategies. Finally, we have described our challenges and future strategies on returning to normal activities.  
Ebstein's anomaly of tricuspid valve with aortic stenosis and coarctation of aorta: Successful single-stage repair of a rare adult congenital heart disease.  ;Ebstein's anomaly of the tricuspid valve is infrequently associated with left heart anomalies. The association of aortic stenosis in Ebstein's anomaly has been reported to be extremely rare and the association of coarctation of aorta is even rarer especially in adults. The combination of all three of these lesions is virtually unknown without any references in literature. We report here an unusual case of Ebstein's anomaly of the tricuspid valve and severe aortic stenosis with coarctation of aorta in an adult who presented to us with exertional dyspnoea in the third decade and underwent a successful single-stage intracardiac repair.  
Transcatheter procedures in structural heart disease: The surgeon stepping-in.  ;The seismic impact of transcatheter interventions is rocking the spectrum of structural heart disease (SHD) treatment, with the compelling and attractive appeal of minimally invasive procedures and fast-track discharge. The trend is relentless and continual innovation comes to our doors nearly on a daily basis. Litwinowicz and colleagues describe their trailblazing experience in 223 consecutive patients in whom they performed left atrial appendage occlusion via the percutaneous route. All interventions were performed by surgeons, who had undergone pretraining in a simulation model. Soon thereafter, they were able to achieve outcomes that were comparable with those obtained by experienced interventional cardiologists. The unique surgeons' training and skills in open-heart surgery make their contribution to perfection and safety of SHD treatment, which are potentially exceptional and distinctive. Extrapolating for the entire field of SHD, which is blossoming ahead, the message to be conveyed is that cardiac surgeons must be trained and embrace every aspect of SHD.  
In-hospital clinical outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve replacement in patients with concomitant carotid artery stenosis: Insights from the national inpatient sample.  ;"BACKGROUND: Carotid artery stenosis (CAS) is a common occurrence in elderly patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). We conducted a retrospective study to identify the impact of CAS on in-hospital outcomes following TAVR. METHODS: We queried the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) for 2016-2017 and identified patients who underwent TAVR with concomitant CAS using the ICD-10 codes. The primary endpoint of our study was in-hospital mortality and acute ischemic stroke. RESULTS: We identified 80,740 TAVR-related hospitalizations. Of these, 6.9% (N = 5555) patients had concomitant CAS. The mean age for CAS patients was 80 ± 7.4 years. Females were represented equally in both groups. Traditional comorbidities like dyslipidemia [78.3% (N = 4350) vs. 68.2% (N = 51261); P < 0.001] and peripheral arterial disease [27.4% (N = 1525) vs. 12.7% (N = 9526); P < 0.001] were more frequently observed among CAS patients. Patients with CAS had higher rates of previous stroke [17.5% (N = 970) vs. 11.8% (N = 8902); P < 0.001] and CABG 23.8% (N = 1320) vs. 18.6% (N = 14022); P < 0.001]. Other cardiovascular risk factors were similar between the two groups. Moreover, no differences in in-hospital outcomes including mortality [odds ratio (OR): 1.35, CI: 0.48-3.83; P = 0.57] were observed in the propensity matched cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Our study did not find any major differences in outcomes in the CAS group following TAVR; however, a more detailed randomized controlled study with long-term follow-up of these patients is needed.

The clinical impact of phase offset errors and different correction methods in cardiovascular magnetic resonance phase contrast imaging: a multi-scanner study.  ;BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) phase contrast (PC) flow measurements suffer from phase offset errors. Background subtraction based on stationary phantom measurements can most reliably be used to overcome this inaccuracy. Stationary tissue correction is an alternative and does not require additional phantom scanning. The aim of this study was 1) to compare measurements with and without stationary tissue correction to phantom corrected measurements on different GE Healthcare CMR scanners using different software packages and 2) to evaluate the clinical implications of these methods. METHODS: CMR PC imaging of both the aortic and pulmonary artery flow was performed in patients on three different 1.5 T CMR scanners (GE Healthcare) using identical scan parameters. Uncorrected, first, second and third order stationary tissue corrected flow measurement were compared to phantom corrected flow measurements, our reference method, using Medis QFlow, Circle cvi42 and MASS software. The optimal (optimized) stationary tissue order was determined per scanner and software program. Velocity offsets, net flow, clinically significant difference (deviation > 10% net flow), and regurgitation severity were assessed. RESULTS: Data from 175 patients (28 (17-38) years) were included, of which 84% had congenital heart disease. First, second and third order and optimized stationary tissue correction did not improve the velocity offsets and net flow measurements. Uncorrected measurements resulted in the least clinically significant differences in net flow compared to phantom corrected data. Optimized stationary tissue correction per scanner and software program resulted in net flow differences (> 10%) in 19% (MASS) and 30% (Circle cvi42) of all measurements compared to 18% (MASS) and 23% (Circle cvi42) with no correction. Compared to phantom correction, regurgitation reclassification was the least common using uncorrected data. One CMR scanner performed worse and significant net flow differences of > 10% were present both with and without stationary tissue correction in more than 30% of all measurements. CONCLUSION: Phase offset errors had a significant impact on net flow quantification, regurgitation assessment and varied greatly between CMR scanners. Background phase correction using stationary tissue correction worsened accuracy compared to no correction on three GE Healthcare CMR scanners. Therefore, careful assessment of phase offset errors at each individual scanner is essential to determine whether routine use of phantom correction is necessary.

Outcomes of emergency or urgent mitral valve repair in patients with papillary muscle rupture and active infective endocarditis.  ;"BACKGROUND: Emergency or urgent surgery is often required in patients with papillary muscle rupture and active mitral valve infective endocarditis. The aim of this study was to analyze the outcomes of patients with active endocarditis who underwent emergency or urgent mitral valve repair. METHODS: From 2005 to 2014, 154 ischemic mitral regurgitation patients and 41 infective endocarditis patients underwent mitral valve repair in our institution; 23 had emergency operations due to papillary muscle rupture, and 18 with active infective endocarditis underwent urgent surgery. RESULTS: Cardiopulmonary bypass time (141.4 ± 43.3 versus 145.3 ± 46.5 min) and crossclamp time (77.7 ± 34.1 versus 79.2 ± 33.0 min) were similar in the papillary muscle rupture and elective ischemic mitral regurgitation subgroups, and major postoperative complications were comparable. Hospital mortality was 17.4% in the papillary muscle rupture subgroup and 8.4% in the elective ischemic mitral regurgitation subgroup. Cardiopulmonary bypass time (103.6 ± 37.0 versus 75.5 ± 20.8 min) and crossclamp time (61.7 ± 21.2 versus 45.3 ± 18.0 min) were significantly longer in infective endocarditis patients. There were no major complications or hospital deaths. Eight years postoperatively, overall survival was 94.4% and 86.5% in the papillary muscle rupture and elective ischemic mitral regurgitation subgroups, respectively (p = 0.730). Overall survival was 100% in both infective endocarditis subgroups. CONCLUSION: The feasibility and effectiveness of emergency or urgent mitral valve repair in patients with papillary muscle rupture and active infective endocarditis are satisfactory. Early and mid-term outcomes are comparable to those of elective operations.  "
Senst B(1), Kumar A(2), Diaz RR(3).  ;"Cardiac surgery is the specialty of medicine concerning the surgical treatment of pathologies related to the heart and thoracic aorta. The spectrum of modern cardiac surgery can be understood by its history beginning at the end of the 19th century. Since then cardiac surgery developed through the work of numerous dedicated surgeons offering more and more treatments for diverse cardiac pathology. This development is still ongoing today. In 1882, Billroth performed the first pericardiectomy. The first successful treatment of cardiac trauma was done by Ludwig Rehn when he operated on a cardiac stab wound in 1896 against the wide held belief that the heart is not an organ on which surgeons should operate. The development of cardiopulmonary bypass was necessary to reach the structures of interest and was pushed by the high mortality of the early cardiac operations like embolectomy (first completed by Trendelenburg). Surgical revascularization is one option to relieve ischemic heart disease with complicated atherosclerosis. Vineberg implanted the left internal mammary artery (LIMA) into the anterior free wall forming no direct anastomoses to the coronary vessels. He has observed, in earlier experiments, that collaterals develop when ischemia is present. During the 1960s several surgeons in different locations pioneered the first coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) operations. The era of reversing coronary artery disease started with the invention of cardiac catheterization by Forssman in 1929 and injection of contrast media to visualize coronary vessels and locate stenosis by Shirey in 1962. Bypass grafting and interventional revascularisation form the 2 main possibilities to treat ischemic heart disease besides drug treatment. Surgical treatment of valvulopathies started closed mitral commissurotomy by passing a finger or instrument through the narrow orifice of the mitral stenosis to dilate or cut it as did Cutler in 1923 for the first time. The Hufnagel cage and ball valve was the first artificial valve introduced in 1952. It was placed in the descending thoracic aorta to prohibit blood flow reversal in aortic regurgitation. In 1967 a similarly structured valve, the Edwards cage and ball valve, had been implanted 1000 times for mitral valve disease. Surgical techniques improved from early, single valve procedures to 4-valve replacement in 1992. Special techniques were introduced, for example, the Ross procedure replacing the aortic valve with pulmonic valve autograft. To treat proximal aortic dissection or aneurysm, Bentall implanted an artificial aortic valve combined with ascending aortic vessel prosthesis. In 1944, cardiac surgeons Blalock, Taussig, and Thomas first forayed into the field of congenital heart lesions, when they operated on the tetralogy of Fallot, one of the cyanotic heart lesions.There are also acyanotic heart lesions such as pulmonary stenosis. Regarding cardiac arrhythmias, the Cox-Maze procedure offers surgical treatment of atrial fibrillation. The evolution of cardiac pacemakers started by applying external electrodes to stimulate the heart. Lillehei placed electrodes directly to the heart during open heart surgery. The first implanted pacemaker lasted only 8 hours. Modern aggregates offer long-lasting solutions to diverse rhythm abnormalities. In 1967, several surgical teams around the world performed the first heart transplantations: Barnard in South Africa, Shumway in Stanford (offering increased post-transplant survival by adding immunosuppressive treatment), and Kantrowitz with pediatric transplantation in New York. Some devices can supply mechanical circulatory support. Since 1963, the intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) enhanced left ventricular function through the mechanism of counterpulsation. Open heart surgery requires a cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) to temporarily replace the human heart and lung by an external circuit consisting of pumps and an oxygenation membrane. Artificial hearts were first applied extracorporal in 1982. Later devices allowed for implantation. Cardiac surgery represents high operative and perioperative risk requiring professional staff and advanced equipment. Besides the diseases that require cardiac surgery, the perioperative period shows a variety of characteristic pathologies: systemic inflammatory response following CBP, myocardial stunning and low cardiac output syndrome, arrhythmias, massive transfusion requirements and multiorgan involvement with kidney injury, stroke, and respiratory distress. With the surge of interventional and minimally invasive methods to treat cardiac pathologies, the medical fields of cardiology and cardiac surgery recently need to adapt to these changes. As Lytle and Mack described in their 2005 editorial, ""The times they are changing"" the field of cardiac surgery is undergoing a fundamental transformation. In his presidential address, Guyton said: ""if we do not embrace innovation we will become its victims."" Recent developments include the upcoming of cardiac arrest centers, broader and simpler application of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), organizational changes such as fast-track hospital stay, and interprofessional decision making by heart teams, and challenges posed by an aging patient population.

Hybrid Positron Emission Tomography/Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Arrhythmic Mitral Valve Prolapse.  ;IMPORTANCE: Myocardial replacement fibrosis has been reported to occur in one-third of patients with mitral valve prolapse (MVP) and significant mitral regurgitation (MR). However, it remains unknown whether there are detectable changes in myocardial metabolism suggestive of inflammation or ischemia that accompany the development of fibrosis. OBJECTIVES: To characterize the burden and distribution of fluorine 18-labeled (18F) fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) in patients with degenerative MVP and ventricular ectopy. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospective observational study of 20 patients with MVP and significant primary degenerative MR who were referred for mitral valve repair and underwent hybrid positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI). Ventricular arrhythmias were categorized as either complex (n = 12) or minor (n = 8). Coregistered hybrid 18F FDG-PET and MRI LGE images were assessed and categorized. Recruitment occurred in the new patient clinic of a mitral valve repair reference center. This study was conducted from January 11, 2018, to June 26, 2019. EXPOSURES: Simultaneous cardiac 18F FDG-PET and MRI with LGE imaging on a hybrid PET/MRI system and ambulatory rhythm monitoring. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Patients were categorized by the presence and pattern of FDG uptake and LGE, the severity of ventricular arrhythmias, and the indication for mitral valve surgery. RESULTS: In the cohort of 20 patients, the median age was 59.5 years (interquartile range, 52.5-63.2 years). Focal, or focal-on-diffuse uptake, of 18F-FDG (PET positive) was detected in 17 of 20 patients (85%). The FDG uptake coexisted with areas of LGE (PET/MRI positive) in 14 patients (70%). Of the 5 asymptomatic patients with normal ventricular indices and absence of any surgical indications, all were PET/MRI positive. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this pilot study, we demonstrate a novel association between degenerative MVP and FDG uptake, a surrogate for myocardial inflammation and/or ischemia. Such evidence of myocardial injury, even in asymptomatic patients, suggests an ongoing subclinical disease process. These findings warrant further investigation into whether imaging for myocardial inflammation, ischemia, and scar has a role in arrhythmic risk stratification and whether it provides incremental prognostic value in patients with chronic severe mitral regurgitation undergoing active surveillance.  
Analysis of Atrial Fibrillation Treatment Regimes in a Multicenter Cohort of Transcatheter Edge-to-Edge Mitral Valve Repair Patients.  ;BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a highly prevalent comorbidity in patients with severe mitral valve regurgitation (MR). Recent studies show a deleterious outcome of patients with concomitant AF after transcatheter mitral valve repair (TMVR). This underlines the essential need for additional strategies that ameliorate the prognosis of these patients. Fundamental data on AF characteristics and treatment regimes in this special cohort of patients are lacking. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the data of 542 consecutive patients with severe MR undergoing TMVR in three tertiary heart centers with special focus on AF type and underlying treatment strategies. RESULTS: The prevalence of concomitant AF was 73.3%, and AF did not affect the procedural success or the incidence of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events. The patients with AF were more frequently >75 years, had more tricuspid regurgitation, and less coronary artery disease than non-AF patients. The distribution of AF types was 32% paroxysmal AF, 27% persistent AF, and 41% permanent AF. Except for a higher degree in severe tricuspid regurgitation and a higher likelihood of male sex, no substantial differences were observed while comparing permanent and nonpermanent AF patients. The predominant treatment regime was rate control (57%), with only beta blockers (BB) in the majority of persistent and permanent AF patients, while additional digitalis or a pacemaker was used infrequently. Rhythm control was mainly achieved with BB alone in paroxysmal AF patients and with additional antiarrhythmic drugs in the majority of persistent AF patients. Interventional rhythm control therapy was performed in 2.5% and 30.9% of paroxysmal and persistent AF patients, respectively. The guideline-adherent use of oral anticoagulants was comparable and high in both groups (91.9% in nonpermanent vs. 90.1% in permanent AF). CONCLUSION: This is the first study to provide necessary information for the understanding of the current clinical practice in dealing with TMVR patients. Since evidence suggests that AF is not a benign concomitant disease, further investigations are needed to assess the prognostic impact of these different AF treatment strategies.

Differences in the presentation and management of patients with severe aortic stenosis in different European centres.  ;"BACKGROUND: An investigation into differences in the management and treatment of severe aortic stenosis (AS) between Germany, France and the UK may allow benchmarking of the different healthcare systems and identification of levers for improvement. METHODS: Patients with a diagnosis of severe AS under management at centres within the IMPULSE and IMPULSE enhanced registries were eligible. RESULTS: Data were collected from 2052 patients (795 Germany; 542 France; 715 UK). Patients in Germany were older (79.8 years), often symptomatic (89.5%) and female (49.8%) and had a lower EF (53.8%) than patients in France and UK. Comorbidities were more common and they had a higher mean Euroscore II.Aortic valve replacement (AVR) was planned within 3 months in 70.2%. This was higher (p<0.001) in Germany than France/ UK. Of those with planned AVR, 82.3% received it within 3 months with a gradual decline (Germany>France> UK; p<0.001). In 253 patients, AVR was not performed, despite planned. Germany had a strong transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) preference (83.2%) versus France/ UK (p<0.001). Waiting time for TAVI was shorter in Germany (24.9 days) and France (19.5 days) than UK (40.3 days).Symptomatic patients were scheduled for an AVR in 79.4% (Germany> France> UK; p<0.001) and performed in 83.6% with a TAVI preference (73.1%). 20.4% of the asymptomatic patients were intervened. CONCLUSION: Patients in Germany had more advanced disease. The rate of intervention within 3 months after diagnosis was startlingly low in the UK. Asymptomatic patients without a formal indication often underwent an intervention in Germany and France.  "
The effect of fundamental curves on geometric orifice and coaptation areas of polymeric heart valves.  ;Valvular diseases, such as aortic stenosis, are considered a common condition in the US. In severe cases, either mechanical or prosthetic heart valves are employed to replace the diseased native valve. The prosthetic heart valve has been a focal point for researchers to gain a better understanding of the mechanics, which will lead to improved longevity. In this study, our objective was to evaluate the effect of fundamental curves on the geometric orifice area and the coaptation area by implementing a two-level Taguchi Orthogonal Array (OA) design (Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) technique) and the interaction plots to investigate the individual contributions. The leaflet geometry was represented with the attachment curve, the free edge, and the belly curve. A total of three varying control coordinates were used to form different leaflet surfaces. With two different biocompatible polymers, 16 finite element models were prepared. Each model was subjected to time-varying transvalvular pressure. The results showed that the control coordinate for the belly curve has the highest impact on the coaptation area of the valve models with higher average 100% modulus. The geometric orifice area was affected by both control points of the attachment curve and the belly curve. A similar effect was also observed for the valve models with lower average 100% modulus.

Octreotide for resuscitation of cardiac arrest due to carcinoid crisis precipitated by novel peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT): A case report.  ;Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) is an effective treatment for metastatic carcinoid tumours but can precipitate a carcinoid crisis through release of stored bioamines. Cardiac arrest is an uncommon manifestation of carcinoid crisis and has never been reported as a complication of PRRT. We report a case of a 58-year old female who suffered from cardiac arrest following PRRT for metastatic carcinoid tumour. She was successfully resuscitated using intravenous octreotide following 22 min of failure to resuscitate with a standard advanced cardiac life support protocol. Following resuscitation, severe carcinoid heart disease was diagnosed, and the patient subsequently underwent successful surgical valve replacement. Although there is no trial evidence, considering pharmacological rationale and successful outcome in this case, we suggest early administration of intravenous octreotide during resuscitation of patients suffering cardiac arrest post PRRT for carcinoid disease and recommend preventive strategies.  
Echocardiographic parameters for the assessment of congestive heart failure in dogs with myxomatous mitral valve disease and moderate to severe mitral regurgitation.  ;The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of congestive heart failure (CHF) on echocardiographic variables in dogs with moderate or severe mitral valve regurgitation (MR) secondary to myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD). The secondary objective was to investigate the preliminary use of left ventricular early inflow-outflow index (LVEIO) and L-waves as indicators of CHF. Forty-five dogs with moderate or severe MR without (n = 23) or with (n = 22) CHF were retrospectively included. Echocardiographic variables of elevated left ventricular (LV) filling pressures and cardiac function, LVEIO and the presence of L-waves were obtained and statistically compared between the two groups. On general linear model analysis, mitral inflow peak E-wave velocity, E:A ratio, ratio of E to isovolumic relaxation time (IVRT) and LVEIO were increased, while left atrium (LA) fractional shortening was reduced, in dogs with CHF. Peak E-wave velocity, peak A-wave velocity, E:A ratio, LA minimum diameter, LA diameter before the P-wave, LA fractional shortening and LVEIO were found to be predictive of CHF. The absence of L-waves indicated a reduced risk of CHF. Several echocardiographic variables may be useful in identifying elevated LV filling pressures, consistent with CHF, in dogs with moderate and severe MR. Left ventricular early inflow-outflow index and L-waves might be of interest as clinical and prognostic markers in dogs with MMVD and require further investigation.  
The clinical significance of the incorporation of tissue Doppler imaging into low-dose Dobutamine stress echocardiography in patients with aortic stenosis prior to Transcatheter aortic valve implantation.  ;BACKGROUND: Low-dose dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) is indicated in patients with low flow (stroke volume index [SVi] < 35 ml/m2) low gradient (mean pressure gradient < 40 mmHg) and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 50% aortic stenosis (AS) to assess LV contractile reserve (> 20% increase in SVi) and severity grade of AS. Severe AS is defined by a mean pressure gradient of 40 mmHg occurring at any time during the test when aortic valve area remains < 1.0 cm2. CASE PRESENTATION: This case report highlights the utility of mitral annular systolic velocity (S') by tissue Doppler imaging and peak LV outflow tract (LVOT) velocity as markers of LV intrinsic contractile function during DSE in a patient with low flow low gradient AS and reduced EF prior to transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). CONCLUSIONS: Mitral annular S' and peak LVOT velocities are reliable markers of LV intrinsic contractile function and should be incorporated into routine low-dose DSE.  
Right-Sided Endocarditis involving Eustachian Valve Following the Use of a Central Venous Line.  ;"BACKGROUND Right-sided endocarditis is a well-known condition that occurs predominantly in intravenous drug users and patients with cardiovascular implantable electronic devices, central venous lines, and congenital heart disease. Most cases involve the tricuspid valve apparatus. Eustachian valve endocarditis (EVE) is a very rare and underdiagnosed condition with only a few previously reported cases. CASE REPORT We present a rare case of 2-sided infective thromboembolism from Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis involving both the eustachian and mitral valves in a 27-year-old man with mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy disease, which is a rare mitochondrial disease. CONCLUSIONS Endocarditis involving the eustachian valve is rare and presents a significant dilemma in diagnosis and treatment. Late diagnosis can lead to missed thromboembolic events and can have a significant impact on treatment and prognosis. In cases with high suspicion, early use of transesophageal echocardiography and chest CT can greatly advance diagnosis. The international guidelines do not specifically address patients with EVE; therefore, we recommend that the endocarditis team should be involved in any case of EVE to customize a treatment strategy.

Early intervention or watchful waiting for asymptomatic severe aortic valve stenosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis.  ;BACKGROUND: The management of patients with severe but asymptomatic aortic stenosis is challenging. Evidence on early aortic valve replacement (AVR) versus symptom-driven intervention in these patients is unknown. METHODS: Electronic databases were searched, articles comparing early-AVR with conservative management for severe aortic stenosis were identified. Pooled adjusted odds ratio (OR) was computed using a random-effect model to determine all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. RESULTS: A total of eight studies consisting of 2201 patients were identified. Early-AVR was associated with lower all-cause mortality [OR 0.24, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.13-0.45, P ≤ 0.00001] and cardiovascular mortality (OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.06-0.70, P = 0.01) compared with conservative management. The number needed to treat to prevent 1 all-cause and cardiovascular mortality was 4 and 9, respectively. The odds of all-cause mortality in a selected patient population undergoing surgical AVR (SAVR) (OR 0.16, 95% CI 0.09-0.29, P ≤ 0.00001) and SAVR or transcatheter AVR (TAVR) (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.35-0.81, P = 0.003) were significantly lower compared with patients who are managed conservatively. A subgroup sensitivity analysis based on severe aortic stenosis (OR 0.24, 95% CI 0.11-0.52, P = 0.0004) versus very severe aortic stenosis (OR 0.20, 95% CI 0.08-0.51, P = 0.0008) also mirrored the findings of overall results. CONCLUSION: Patients with asymptomatic aortic valve stenosis have lower odds of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality when managed with early-AVR compared with conservative management. However, because of significant heterogeneity in the classification of asymptomatic patients, large scale studies are required.  
Oscillatory fluid-induced mechanobiology in heart valves with parallels to the vasculature.  ;Forces generated by blood flow are known to contribute to cardiovascular development and remodeling. These hemodynamic forces induce molecular signals that are communicated from the endothelium to various cell types. The cardiovascular system consists of the heart and the vasculature, and together they deliver nutrients throughout the body. While heart valves and blood vessels experience different environmental forces and differ in morphology as well as cell types, they both can undergo pathological remodeling and become susceptible to calcification. In addition, while the plaque morphology is similar in valvular and vascular diseases, therapeutic targets available for the latter condition are not effective in the management of heart valve calcification. Therefore, research in valvular and vascular pathologies and treatments have largely remained independent. Nonetheless, understanding the similarities and differences in development, calcific/fibrous pathologies and healthy remodeling events between the valvular and vascular systems can help us better identify future treatments for both types of tissues, particularly for heart valve pathologies which have been understudied in comparison to arterial diseases.  
Meta-Analysis of the Incidence, Prevalence, and Correlates of Atrial Fibrillation in Rheumatic Heart Disease.  ;"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the incidence, prevalence, and correlates of atrial fibrillation (AF) in a global population with rheumatic heart disease (RHD). METHODS: Bibliographic databases were searched to identify all published studies providing data on AF in patients with RHD. Random-effects meta-analysis method was used to pool estimates. RESULTS: Eighty-three studies were included, reporting data from 75,637 participants with RHD in 42 countries. The global prevalence of AF in RHD was 32.8% (range: 4.3%-79.9%). It was higher in severe valvular disease (30.8% vs 20.7%, p = 0.009), in severe mitral valve disease compared to severe aortic disease (30.4% vs 6.3%, p = 0.038). The global cumulative incidence of AF in patients with RHD was 4.8%, 11.4%, 13.2%, and 30.8% at 1, 2, 5, and 10 years of follow-up, respectively. From comparison between patients with and without AF, AF was associated with increased age (mean difference [MD]: 9.5 years; 95% CI: 7.8-1.3), advanced heart failure (odds ratio [OR]: 4.4; 95% CI 2.1-9.3), tricuspid valve involvement (OR: 4.0; 95% CI: 3.0-5.3), history of thromboembolism (OR: 6.2; 95% CI: 3.4-11.4), highly sensitive C-reactive protein (MD: 5.5 mg/dL; 95% CI: 1.2-9.8), systolic pulmonary arterial pressure (MD: 3.6 mmHg; 95% CI: 0.8-6.3), right atrium pressure (MD: 1.5 mmHg; 95% CI: 1.0-2.0), and left atrium diameter (MD: 8.1 mm; 95% CI: 5.5-10.7). CONCLUSIONS: About one-third of patients with RHD have AF, with an incidence which almost triples every five years after diagnosis. Factors associated with AF include age, advanced heart failure, thromboembolism, and few cardiac hemodynamics parameters.  "
A population based analysis of trends, risk factors and outcomes associated with gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with left ventricular assist devices.  ;Introduction: Prior to the utilization of continuous flow (CF) devices in 2010, Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding was a common adverse event related to left ventricular assist device (LVADs) that was found to be even more frequent when CF devices were first introduced. Objective: Given the drastic increase in the use of new CF-LVADs, we sought to determine if CF-LVADs are associated with an increased number of GI bleeds and higher mortality. Methods: We analysed the data from a national inpatient sample database using the ICD-9 procedure code for LVAD use in end-stage heart failure among patients > 18 years. The total sample consisted of 2,359 patients (M age=55 ± 13.7 years). A majority of the sample was male (77%) and Caucasian (59%). Results: The Incidence of GI bleeding from 2010 to 2014 was 7.46% with no significant change in yearly incidence over five-year period (P=.793). After controlling for age, sex, and length of stay, multivariate logistic regression revealed that significant predictors of GI bleed were acute kidney injury (AOR=1.87, 95% CI=1.26, 2.80), peripheral vascular disease (AOR=1.77, 95% CI=1.02, 2.94), body mass index ≥ 25 (AOR=.46, 95% CI=.22, .87), hemiplegia or paraplegia (AOR=3.01, 95% CI=1.17, 7.05), moderate or severe liver disease (AOR=2.40, 95% CI=.97, 5.34), peptic ulcer disease (AOR=18.13, 95% CI=7.86, 42.38), surgical aortic valve replacement (AOR=2.46, 95% CI=1.12, 5.15), and venous thromboembolism (AOR=2.58, 95% CI=1.57, 4.15). Conclusion: The results of the study show that GI bleeding is highly prevalent in patients with LVADs and there was no improvement in rates of GI bleed over five years since the CF-LVADs were initially introduced and is associated with an increased likelihood of mortality.  
Right ventricular deformation and right ventricular-arterial coupling in patients with heart failure due to severe aortic stenosis undergoing TAVI: long-term results.  ;"AIM: To evaluate the long-term prognostic significance of right ventricular (RV) deformation and RV-arterial coupling in a cohort of patients with heart failure (HF) due to severe aortic stenosis (AS) candidate for trans-catheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). METHODS: The study is a retrospective analysis of 56 patients undergoing echocardiography before TAVI execution. RV function was defined by tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE), fractional area change (FAC), peak systolic myocardial velocity by tissue Doppler imaging (RVSm) and RV longitudinal strain (RVLS). RV-arterial coupling were defined as TAPSE and RVLS normalized for systolic pulmonary artery pressure (sPAP) to obtain afterload-independent parameters: TAPSE/sPAP and RVLS/sPAP, respectively. All-cause mortality was the primary endpoint of survival analysis; composite of death and hospitalization for HF was the secondary endpoint. RESULTS: All patients underwent TAVI from femoral access. Mean age was 81.6±6.3 years and left ventricular ejection fraction was preserved in most patients (51±15%). At 10 years, using Cox regression analysis adjusted for the parameters related to prognosis at univariate analysis, we found that only pre-procedural RVLS was independently associated with all-cause mortality (aHR 1.53, 95% CI 1.10-2.12, P=0.011). RVLS (aHR 7.542, 95% CI 1.325-42.921, P=0.023), sPAP (aHR 1.421, 95% CI 1.045-1.932, P=0.025), TAPSE/sPAP (aHR 4.977, 95% CI 5.425-21.99, P=0.044) and RVLS/sPAP (aHR 2.333, 95% CI 3.9677-12.999, P=0.046) were independently associated with the secondary endpoint. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with HF due to severe AS undergoing TAVI, deformation imaging (i.e., RVLS) and RV-arterial coupling (i.e., TAPSE/sPAP and RVLS/sPAP) provide better risk stratification at long-term follow up of 10 years than other RV echocardiographic parameters.

Sex-Related Differences in Cardiac Remodeling and Reverse Remodeling After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation in Patients with Severe Aortic Stenosis in a Japanese Population.  ;"Left ventricular (LV) remodeling with aortic stenosis (AS) appears to differ according to sex, but reverse remodeling after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has not been elucidated in a Japanese population. This study aims to determine whether any sex-related differences in LV or reverse remodeling after TAVI exist in the context of severe AS.Of 208 patients who received TAVI for severe AS in our institution, 100 (men, 42; mean age, 83.0 ± 4.9 years) underwent transthoracic echocardiography before and 3 months after TAVI. Despite similar valvular gradients, women with severe AS had lower indexed LV mass (LVMi) than did men (152.3 ± 35.4 versus 173.2 ± 44.6 g/m2, P = 0.005), with smaller indexed LV end-diastolic (LVEDVi) (50.2 ± 13.3 versus 61.4 ± 20.7 mL/m2, P = 0.001) and end-systolic (LVESVi; 17.9 ± 8.7 versus 24.3 ± 13.8 mL/m2, P = 0.006) volumes. After TAVI, women (-6.0% ± 14.4%) had higher reduction in the rate of change of relative wall thickness (RWT) than did men (4.4% ± 19.0%, P = 0.003). Men (-8.9% ± 3.9%) had higher reduction in the rate of change of LVEDVi than did women (1.5% ± 3.3%, P = 0.045). Incidence of LV reverse remodeling defined as a reduction in LVESV of >15% was significantly higher in men (50%) than in women (26%, P = 0.013).In addition to sex differences in the pattern of LV remodeling with AS, reverse LV remodeling after TAVI also differed between sexes.

Evolut Self-Expanding Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in Patients with Extremely Horizontal Aorta (Aortic Root Angle ≥ 70°).  ;"Because of its rigidity and non-steerability, the presence of a horizontal aortic root poses a major anatomical issue during transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) with Evolut self-expanding valve. Previous studies have elucidated the difficulties of coaxial implantation of the self-expanding valve in patients with horizontal aorta, often resulting in increased complications and a lower device success rate. To date, most patients with extremely horizontal aorta (aortic root angle ≥ 70°) have been excluded from major TAVR clinical trials. Therefore, available data on TAVR with Evolut in this challenging anatomy are limited, and standardized treatment strategies and clinical results remain unknown. Herein, we report a clinical case series of TAVR with Evolut in extremely horizontal aorta. Among seven patients (aged 80-92 years; STS score, 12.6% ± 7.9%) who underwent TAVR with Evolut system, aortic root angle ranged from 71° to 83° (mean, 75.1°± 4.5°). All patients achieved device success with dedicated strategies and were clinically stable at 3-month follow-up. None of the patients had more than mild paravalvular leakage (PVL) at any point during follow-up.Complications in three patients included complete atrioventricular block requiring a permanent pacemaker implantation, cerebral infarction because of atrial fibrillation 3 days after TAVR, and cardiac tamponade requiring pericardiocentesis. In this case series, Evolut self-expanding TAVR in extremely horizontal aorta was effective and feasible with a high device success rate. Based on anatomical features, some dedicated strategies majorly contribute to the success of this procedure. Large-scale multicenter studies are required to confirm our findings.  "
Balloon Valvuloplasty to Treat Adult Symptomatic Pulmonary Valve Stenosis with Sequential Follow-Up Using Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Combination with Echocardiography.  ;"Pulmonary valve stenosis (PVS) accounts for approximately 10% of all congenital heart defects. Echocardiography and right heart catheterization are the gold standards for diagnosis of PVS and for assessing disease severity and responsiveness to treatment.Recently, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI) has been established as an important tool to comprehensively evaluate cardiac structure and function; however, research into the usefulness of cMRI for PVS management is limited. Here, we describe a case of a 59-year-old female with isolated, severe PVS who was successfully treated with balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty (BPV) followed by sequential cMRI at 1 and 12 months. Exertional dyspnea and elevated plasma BNP concentration were observed 1 month after BPV; however, echocardiographic findings did not indicate recurrent stenosis or increased pulmonary valve regurgitation but an increase in mitral E/e'. cMRI demonstrated improved systolic forward flow and RV function with enlargement of LV volume, and the rapid increase in LV preload might be associated with the transient deterioration in symptoms and BNP level, which both gradually improved within 3 months after BPV. cMRI further depicted that a reduced RV mass index and increased RV cardiac output were achieved gradually during the follow-up period.In conclusion, cMRI in combination with echocardiography was sufficiently informative to follow-up this PVS patient both before and after BPV. cMRI is easily reproducible in adult patients; therefore, cMRI should be recommended for long-term follow-up in adult PVS patients.

Phosphatase-independent functions of SHP2 and its regulation by small molecule compounds.  ;SHP2 is a non-receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase encoded by the PTPN11 gene in human. Clinically, SHP2 has been identified as a causal factor of several diseases, such as Noonan syndrome, LEOPARD syndrome as well as myeloid malignancies. Interestingly, both loss-of-function and gain-of-function mutations occur in the PTPN11 gene. Analyses by biochemical and cell biological means as well as probing with small molecule compounds have demonstrated that SHP2 has both phosphatase-dependent and independent functions. In comparison with its phosphatase activity, the non-phosphatase-like function of SHP2 has not been well introduced or summarized. This review mainly focuses on the phosphatase-independent functions and its regulation by small molecule compounds as well as their use for disease therapy.  
Transapical Left Ventricular Access for Ventricular Tachycardia Ablation in Patients With Mechanical Aortic and Mitral Valve Prosthesis.  ;DOI: 10.1161/CIRCEP.120.008893 PMID: 32921133  
Recovery of atrial contractile function after cut-and-sew maze for long-standing persistent valvular atrial fibrillation.  ;OBJECTIVE: The recovery of atrial contractile (AC) after maze has been concerned and even questioned. Now, studied the AC recovery degree and its influencing factors. METHOD: 237 patients with valvular long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) were retrospectively grouped according to whether sinus rhythm(SR) maintained and AC restored: SR-AC (163 cases), SR-no-AC (41 cases) and AF-no-AC (33 cases). SR-AC were grouped according to Em/Am ratio. Em/Am≤2 showed that the AC recovered well. RESULTS: The SR maintained rate (161/177, 90.96%) in patients underwent the cut-and-sew maze III (CSM) was significantly higher than that in cryoablation (43/60, 71.7%). Preoperative AF duration had no significant difference among three groups (P = 0.679). Maze methods had significant relationship with whether SR recovered, P < 0.05, but no significant relationship with whether AC recovered in SR maintained patients (P = 0.280). Nearly 80% (163/204) patients can recover AC, among 156 patients (156/204, 76.5%) recovered contractile of left and right atrium, and 63 (63/204, 30.1%) recovered significant left atrial contractile, that is, Em/Am≤2. Whether AC was significantly restored was not related to maze methods, P = 0.370. AC recovered degree in rheumatic heart disease (RHD) patients was worse than that in mitral valve prolapse (MVP) patients, P = 0.004. CONCLUSION: To sum up, the CSM is safe and effective, and the atrial contractile function recovery was found in 80%. The key to the success of maze is to form a complete and lasting electrical isolation, and there was no difference in the rate of atrial contractile recovery when postoperative SR was maintained, no matter what maze method is used. MVP patients should be treated with maze more actively than RHD patients.  
Surgical Treatment for Left Main Coronary Atresia with Significant Mitral Regurgitation in a 1-Year-Old Child.  ;Congenital atresia of the left main coronary artery (LMCA) is an extremely rare coronary anomaly that necessitates surgical correction. Patients with LMCA atresia may have various clinical symptoms, which are determined by the degree of collateral vessel development from the right coronary system, the metabolic demands of the heart, and concomitant mitral insufficiency caused by myocardial ischemia. Unlike in adults, there are limited surgical options for coronary artery disease in children. Herein, we report a case of LMCA atresia with mitral regurgitation in a 19-month-old child that was successfully corrected by coronary artery bypass grafting and mitral valve repair.  
Right ventricular strain in repaired Tetralogy of Fallot with regards to pulmonary valve replacement.  ;PURPOSE: To assess right ventricular (RV) myocardial strain both globally and segmentally through feature-tracking cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) in patients with Tetralogy of Fallot (ToF), with regards to pulmonary valve replacement (PVR). METHODS: After Ethics Committee approval, we retrospectively included 46 consecutive ToF patients who had two CMR examinations performed at our institution between March 2014 and June 2019. We divided patients into those who had not undergone PVR between the two CMR examinations (Group-0), and those who had (Group-1). Ventricular volumes were quantified on cine sequences, and strain was calculated through feature-tracking, using the previously traced segmentations. RV longitudinal and radial strain were assessed both globally and separately for the septum and free wall. Variations were normalized for intercurrent years, differences were appraised with t-tests or Mann-Whitney U. RESULTS: 30 patients belonged to Group-0 and 16 to Group-1. Median age was 22 years (interquartile range [IQR] 17-29 years) in Group-0, and 21 years (IQR 16-29 years) in Group-1. No significant differences were reported in RV strain between groups (p ≥ 0.254) except for RV septal radial strain, significantly higher (p = 0.010) in Group-0 (24.2 %, IQR 10.1-52.4 %) than in Group-1 (6.0 %, IQR -3.3-23.3 %) at the second CMR. Both global and segmental RV strains decreased over time in both groups, and yearly variations did not differ significantly (p ≥ 0.081) between groups. CONCLUSIONS: While PVR performed at the appropriate timing eases the burden on the RV allowing for a reduction in volumes, RV strain seems to continuously deteriorate as in patients who do not undergo PVR.  
Effect of Progression of Valvular Calcification on Left Ventricular Structure and Frequency of Incident Heart Failure (from the Multiethnic Study of Atherosclerosis).  ;"Heart failure (HF) is a leading cause of morbidity. Strategies for preventing HF are paramount. Prevalent extracoronary calcification is associated with HF risk but less is known about progression of mitral annular (MAC) and aortic valve calcification (AVC) and HF risk. Progression of valvular calcification (VC) [interval change of >0 units/yr] was assessed by 2 cardiac computed tomography scans over a median of 2.4 years. We used Cox regression to determine the risk of adjudicated HF and linear mixed effects models to determine 10-year change in left ventricular (LV) parameters measured by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging associated with VC progression. We studied 5,591 MESA participants free of baseline cardiovascular disease. Mean ± SD age was 62 ± 10 years; 53% women; 83% had no VC progression, 15% progressed at 1 site (AVC or MAC) and 3% at both sites. There were 251 incident HF over 15 years. After adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors, the hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) of HF associated with VC progression at 1 and 2 sites were 1.62 (1.21 to 2.17) and 1.88 (1.14 to 3.09), respectively, compared with no progression (p-for-trend <0.001). Hazard ratios were higher for HFpEF (2.52 [1.63 to 3.90] and 2.49 [1.19 to 5.25]) but nonsignificant for HFrEF. Both AVC (1.61 [1.19 to 2.19]) and MAC (1.50 [1.09 to 2.07]) progression were associated with HF. VC was associated with worsening of some LV parameters over 10 years. In conclusion, VC progression was associated with increased risk of HF and change in LV function. Interventions targeted at reducing VC progression may also impact HF risk, particularly HFpEF.  "
Subtype of atrial fibrillation and the outcome of transcatheter aortic valve replacement: The FinnValve Study.  ;"Whether the subtype of atrial fibrillation affects outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis is unclear. The nationwide FinnValve registry included 2130 patients who underwent primary after transcatheter aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis during 2008-2017. Altogether, 281 (13.2%) patients had pre-existing paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, 651 (30.6%) had pre-existing non-paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and 160 (7.5%) were diagnosed with new-onset atrial fibrillation during the index hospitalization. The median follow-up was 2.4 (interquartile range: 1.6-3.8) years. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation did not affect 30-day or overall mortality (p-values >0.05). Non-paroxysmal atrial fibrillation demonstrated an increased risk of overall mortality (hazard ratio: 1.61, 95% confidence interval: 1.35-1.92; p<0.001), but not 30-day mortality (p = 0.084). New-onset atrial fibrillation demonstrated significantly increased 30-day mortality (hazard ratio: 2.76, 95% confidence interval: 1.25-6.09; p = 0.010) and overall mortality (hazard ratio: 1.68, 95% confidence interval: 1.29-2.19; p<0.001). The incidence of early or late stroke did not differ between atrial fibrillation subtypes (p-values >0.05). In conclusion, non-paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and new-onset atrial fibrillation are associated with increased mortality after transcatheter aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis, whereas paroxysmal atrial fibrillation has no effect on mortality. These findings suggest that non-paroxysmal atrial fibrillation rather than paroxysmal atrial fibrillation may be associated with structural cardiac damage which is of prognostic significance in patients with aortic stenosis undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

Association of transcatheter direct mitral annuloplasty with acute anatomic, haemodynamic, and clinical outcomes in severe mitral valve regurgitation.  ;AIMS: Several approaches for transcatheter mitral valve repair for functional mitral valve regurgitation are established. Interventional direct annuloplasty is a novel trans-venous, trans-septal approach. While feasibility was proven recently, knowledge on its influence on cardiac dimensions, pressures, biomarkers, and clinical outcomes is sparse. METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients consecutively treated with direct annuloplasty-only procedures between December 2015 and April 2018 were included in this monocentric analysis. Echocardiographic measurements, biomarker levels, clinical status [New York Heart Association (NYHA) class and 6 min walk test] were assessed at baseline, at discharge, and at a 30 day follow-up. Overall, 18 patients (in mean 77.0 ± 7.4 years, 44.4% women) with initially all high-grade mitral valve regurgitation (MR) were included in this study. Procedural success rate was high (94.4%) without severe complications. Direct annuloplasty resulted in MR-reduction (post-procedural-MR mild or no/trace: 72.2%) and the proportion of patients with severe dyspnoea (NYHA III/IV) was reduced (88.9% vs. 50%, P = 0.008). Clinical results were associated with a relevant diminution of left atrial volumes (-16.5%, P < 0.001) and cardiac pressures [left atrial pressure (-32.3%, P = 0.019) and systolic pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP, -15.8%, P = 0.025)]. Patients with lower baseline levels of PAP (P = 0.022) as well as elevated highly sensitive troponin (P = 0.034) were more likely to archive clinical benefit (improvement in NYHA class ≥1 grade) after 1 month, which could not be correlated with the grade of MR-reduction. CONCLUSIONS: Transcatheter mitral valve repair by direct annuloplasty results in a relevant reduction of intracardiac pressures, left atrial volumes, dyspnoea, and MR. Lower PAP and higher troponin values at baseline could be associated to dyspnoea reduction.  
"Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement for Residual Lesion of the Aortic Valve Following ""Healed"" Infective Endocarditis.  ";"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the safety and mid-term efficacy of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in the setting of aortic valve (AV) infective endocarditis (IE) with residual lesion despite successful antibiotic treatment. BACKGROUND: Patients with AV-IE presenting residual lesion despite successful antibiotic treatment are often rejected for cardiac surgery due to high-risk. The use of TAVR following IE is not recommended. METHODS: This was a multicenter retrospective study across 10 centers, gathering baseline, in-hospital, and 1-year follow-up characteristics of patients with healed AV-IE treated with TAVR. Matched comparison according to sex, EuroSCORE, chronic kidney disease, left ventricular function, prosthesis type, and valve-in-valve procedure was performed with a cohort of patients free of prior IE treated with TAVR (46 pairs). RESULTS: Among 2,920 patients treated with TAVR, 54 (1.8%) presented with prior AV-IE with residual valvular lesion and healed infection. They had a higher rate of multivalvular disease and greater surgical risk scores. A previous valvular prosthesis was more frequent than a native valve (50% vs. 7.5%; p < 0.001). The in-hospital and 1-year mortality rates were 5.6% and 11.1%, respectively, comparable to the control cohort. After matching, the 1-year III to IV aortic regurgitation rate was 27.9% (vs. 10%; p = 0.08) and was independently associated with higher mortality. There was only 1 case of IE relapse (1.8%); however, 18% of patients were complicated with sepsis, and 43% were readmitted due to heart failure. CONCLUSIONS: TAVR is a safe therapeutic alternative for residual valvular lesion after successfully healed AV-IE. At 1-year follow-up, the risk of IE relapse was low and mortality rate did not differ from TAVR patients free of prior IE, but one-fourth presented with significant aortic regurgitation and >50% required re-admission.

Incidence, Predictors, and Outcomes of Endocarditis After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in the United States.  ;"OBJECTIVES: This study sought to evaluate the incidence and outcomes of endocarditis after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). BACKGROUND: Data about endocarditis after TAVR are limited. METHODS: The study investigated Medicare patients who underwent TAVR from 2012 to 2017 and identified patients admitted with endocarditis during follow-up using a validated algorithm. The main study outcome was all-cause mortality. RESULTS: Of 134,717 patients who underwent TAVR, 1868 patients developed endocarditis during follow-up (incidence 0.87%/year), with majority of infections (65.0%) occurring within 1 year. Incidence of endocarditis declined in recent years. The most common organisms were Staphylococcus (22.0%), Streptococcus (20.0%), and Enterococcus (15.5%). Important predictors for endocarditis were younger age at TAVR, male sex, prior endocarditis, end-stage renal disease, repeat TAVR procedures, liver and lung disease, and post-TAVR acute kidney injury. Thirty-day and 1-year mortality were 18.5% and 45.6%, respectively. After adjusting for comorbidities and procedural complications, endocarditis after TAVR was associated with 3-fold higher risk of mortality (44.9 vs. 16.2 deaths per 100 person-years; adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]: 2.94; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.77 to 3.12; p < 0.0001). End-stage renal disease (aHR: 2.12; 95% CI: 1.72 to 2.60), endocarditis complicated by cardiogenic shock (aHR: 2.50, 95% CI: 1.56 to 4.02), ischemic stroke (aHR: 1.56; 95% CI: 1.07 to 2.28), intracerebral hemorrhage (aHR: 1.67; 95% CI: 1.01 to 2.76), acute kidney injury (aHR: 1.44; 95% CI: 1.27 to 1.63), blood transfusion (aHR: 1.28; 95% CI: 1.09 to 1.50), staphylococcal (aHR: 1.71; 95% CI: 1.49 to 1.97), and fungal endocarditis (aHR: 1.72; 95% CI: 1.23 to 2.39) (p < 0.05 for all) portended higher mortality following endocarditis. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of endocarditis after TAVR is low and declining. However, it is associated with poor prognosis with one-half the patients dying within 1 year.  "
Infective endocarditis due to Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae in a dog - a case report.  ;BACKGROUND: Infective endocarditis is a rare but severe condition associated with a high mortality rate in small animal patients. This condition is caused by a microbial (most often bacterial) infection of the valvular portion of the endocardium, from which proliferative and/or erosive lesions on the cardiac valves or immediately adjacent structures develop. The two most commonly affected cardiac valves are the aortic and mitral valves. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the clinical case of a 4-year old male neutered Bull terrier, 27.6 kg, body condition score 4/9, that presented with a 3-months history of pyrexia and general weakness. The patient history also revealed a transient left hind limb lameness (grade 2/4), which coincided with the onset of clinical signs about 3 months before presentation. On physical examination, a left-sided systolic heart murmur (grade 3/6) with the same intensity at the left heart base and apex, and an irregularly irregular heart rhythm were noted. Electrocardiography showed ventricular premature complexes, and echocardiography revealed lesions consistent with endocarditis involving the aortic and mitral valve. Bacterial culture of blood yielded a positive result, and the organism isolated was identified as Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae. The extended patient history revealed that the dog lived close to a farm housing pigs and other livestock. CONCLUSION: We report a rare case of the premortal diagnosis of infective bacterial endocarditis in a dog due to E. rhusiopathiae infection. Most reports about this condition are from necropsy series. This clinical case report emphasizes that E. rhusiopathiae infection and bacteremia should be considered as a differential diagnosis in dogs with suspected infective endocarditis, especially in dogs living in rural areas with access to livestock and particularly farm pigs. Also, particular emphasis should be placed on the zoonotic potential of this infectious disease.  
Permanent His Bundle Pacing Implantation Facilitated by Visualization of the Tricuspid Valve Annulus.  ;BACKGROUND: His bundle pacing (HBP) is the most physiological pacing modality. However, HBP has longer procedure times with frequent high capture thresholds, which likely contributes to the low adoption of this approach. The aim of this study is to compare HBP implantation with a novel imaging technique versus the standard implantation technique. METHODS: This study included 50 patients with standard pacing indications randomized to HBP with visualization of the tricuspid valve annulus (N=25, the visualization group) or with the standard method (N=25, the control group). In the visualization group, the tricuspid valve annulus was imaged by contrast injection in the right ventricle during fluoroscopy. The site for HBP was identified in relationship to the tricuspid septal leaflet and interventricular septum. RESULTS: Permanent HBP was successful in 92% in the visualization group and 88% in the control group. The fluoroscopic time for HBP lead placement was significantly shorter in the visualization group (7.1±3.3 minutes) compared with the control group (10.1±5.6 minutes, P=0.03). Total procedural and fluoroscopic times were also significantly shorter in the visualization group (91.0±15.7 and 9.6±3.8 minutes) than the control group (104.4±17.8 and 12.7±6.2 minutes, P=0.01 and 0.04, respectively). There was no significant difference in capture threshold between groups. In the visualization group, there was a quantitative association between the HBP site and the tricuspid valve annulus. CONCLUSIONS: The visualization technique shortens the procedural and fluoroscopic times for HBP implantation. Moreover, anatomic localization of HBP sites is strongly associated with physiological characteristics of pacing, which can help guide optimal lead placement.

Comparative Intermediate-Term Outcomes of Subclavian and Transcaval Access for Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.  ;"BACKGROUND: Multiple alternative access routes have been employed for patients with contraindications to standard transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR); however, the optimal route for alternative access approaches is not established. In order to better understand possible differences in alternative access routes, we compared the procedural efficacy and outcomes at 30 days and 1 year in patients who underwent TAVR via subclavian (SC) or transcaval (TC) access route at a single, tertiary-care center. METHODS: This retrospective analysis included all TAVR procedures performed via SC or TC approaches between December 2011 to January 2020, with outcomes reported to 1 year post procedure. Additional safety and feasibility studies, including successful device deployment, procedural time, blood loss, and total hospitalization length, are included as part of this study. RESULTS: A total of 41 patients underwent SC access and 22 patients underwent TC access for TAVR. Between both cohorts, SC patients were older at the time of TAVR (83.2 ± 3.7 years for SC vs 80.7 ± 3.9 years for TC; P=.03) and all patients were previously deemed high or prohibitive surgical risk (Society of Thoracic Surgeons score, aortic valve replacement only: 10.4 ± 2.6% for SC vs 9.0 ± 1.9% for TC; P=.12), with similar preoperative hemodynamic profiles. PROCEDURAL SAFETY: Device deployment was successful in all patients in both groups, with longer procedural times noted in the SC cohort (62.1 ± 12.1 minutes for SC vs 39.8 ± 12.5 minutes for TC; P<.05). There were no in-hospital deaths in the SC group and 1 intraoperative death in the TC group that was unrelated to access route. Average length of hospital stay was consistent between the two groups (3.8 ± 1.4 days for SC vs 3.4 ± 1.1 days for TC; P=.06). More cerebrovascular accidents were noted in the SC group at 30 days (6 for SC vs 1 for TC), 6 months (3 for SC vs 0 for TC), and 1 year (2 for SC vs 0 for TC), with more postprocedural permanent pacemakers implanted in the SC group at 30 days (9 for SC vs 3 for TC; P<.05, but with fewer at 6 months (2 for SC vs 3 for TC) and 1 year (1 for SC vs 2 for TC). Mortality rate was not statistically different between the two groups at 30 days, 6 months, and 1 year (P>.05 for all). CONCLUSION: Both SC and TC access routes can be safe and feasible options for TAVR in patients at increased or prohibitive surgical risk with contraindications to standard transfemoral access.  "
AGEs-RAGE axis causes endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition in early calcific aortic valve disease via TGF-β1 and BMPR2 signaling.  ;Recent studies reported that advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) were involved in the calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD). However, the roles of AGEs in EndMT in the development of CAVD have not been elucidated. In this study, six-week-old male Apoe-/- mice were divided into four groups based on the following feeding periods: 0, 2, 4, and 6 months. The latter three groups were further divided into three subgroups corresponding to the following diet treatments: normal diet, high-fat diet + normal saline injection, and high-fat diet + aminoguanidine injection. Weight gain was monitored weekly. Finally, heart echocardiographic assessments were performed, and serum lipid levels, the protein expression and the histological changes in the aortic valves were determined. Results showed that the AGE inhibitor aminoguanidine alleviated the transaortic valve velocity and decreased the total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Calcification and carboxymethyl-lysine deposition were firstly detected around the aortic valve surfaces, whereas aminoguanidine injection attenuated their accumulation. In the early stage, HFD-activated AGEs-RAGE signaling resulted in the alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) upregulation and the vascular endothelium cadherin (VE-cadherin) downregulation on the valve endothelial layer. The activation resulted in early the transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) and the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) upregulation, and simultaneously reduced the bone morphogenetic protein receptor type II (BMPR2) expression. However, aminoguanidine restricted these proteins changes by inhibiting the interaction of AGEs and RAGE. In addition, immunofluorescence images showed obvious double-positive staining of ALP and α-SMA on the valve surfaces, revealing the contribution of EndMT to the early calcification. Therefore, this study demonstrates that activation of the AGEs-RAGE axis induced EndMT, promoting the progression of the aortic valve calcification in the initial stage via the counteraction of BMPR2 and TGF-β1 signaling.  
Update on the Current Status and Indications for Transcatheter Edge-to-Edge Mitral Valve Repair.  ;PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To review the current status and indications of transcatheter edge-to-edge mitral valve repair. RECENT FINDINGS: Mitral regurgitation remains a common valvular disease and can be classified as degenerative (primary) or functional (secondary). Randomized controlled trials have shown that transcatheter edge-to-edge mitral valve repair with MitraClip is successful, safe, and effective in reducing mitral regurgitation. The US Food and Drug Administration approved MitraClip in 2013 for treatment of patients with primary mitral regurgitation at prohibitive surgical risk and in 2019 for secondary mitral regurgitation. Several MitraClip generations exist (NT/R, XT/R, NTW, and XTW) with unique features and considerations. Additional edge-to-edge repair, non-edge-to-edge repair, and transcatheter valve replacement systems are under investigation as stand-alone or adjunctive therapy for patients with mitral regurgitation. Mitral regurgitation remains a significant health burden and many patients are not suitable for surgical repair or replacement. Transcatheter mitral valve therapies can be considered in selected patients and are safe and effective. More research is needed to understand how to best select devices and patients and optimize outcomes.  
Bridging Anticoagulation with Mechanical Heart Valves: Current Guidelines and Clinical Decisions.  ;"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The management of patients with mechanical heart valves who require surgery or invasive procedures is a common clinical scenario in contemporary practice. The risk of thromboembolism versus the risk of bleeding is the foundation of optimal patient care. RECENT FINDINGS: Randomized, controlled trials are not available; yet, there is a wealth of experience to guide best practice. Current guidelines represent a compilation of data from trials of atrial fibrillation and expert opinion. Results from the PERI-OP trial of patients with either a mechanical heart valve, atrial fibrillation, or atrial flutter requiring interruption of oral anticoagulant therapy for surgery will inform clinical practice. Patient-specific factors and valve-specific factors are paramount when deciding whether a period of anticoagulant therapy interruption is safe. Similarly, the safety and efficacy of bridging anticoagulant therapy and the optimal time after surgery for restarting oral anticoagulants is vital to optimal patient care.  "
Minimally invasive surgical and transcatheter interventions for aortic valve incompetence: current concepts and future perspectives.  ;"We are currently witnessing rapid evolution in minimally invasive surgical- (MI-AVS) and transcatheter (TAVR) techniques and innovations for the treatment of aortic valve disease. Current TAVR technology approved for the treatment of aortic valve stenosis do not consistently perform favourably in non-calcified aortic valve regurgitation (AR). Surgical aortic valve repair (AVr) by conventional midline sternotomy is generally accepted as the contemporary ""gold standard"" intervention, while prosthetic aortic valve replacement and the wellknown Ross procedure as a biological alternative to AVr, are reserved for patients who are at risk of early repair failure. AVr offers potential benefits over prosthetic replacement in younger patients with contraindications to long term anticoagulation and life-expectancies greater than the expected structural prosthetic valve degeneration. Even though excellent AVr outcomes are achieved in high-volume expert centres, it is generally regarded to be technically challenging, have significant learning curves and is subsequently infrequently performed by inexperienced surgeons. MI-AVS, however, is now the routine approach for isolated aortic valve surgery in various cardiac centres and reports that describe minimally invasive AVr outcomes are progressively emerging. This article outlines the current role and future perspectives of contemporary AR repair techniques by MI-AVS and describe the ongoing evolution of exciting TAVR technology designed specifically for the treatment of non-calcified AR.

(S029) Managing therapeutic anticoagulation in bariatric surgery patients.  ;INTRODUCTION: Patients that undergo bariatric surgery are at risk of bleeding. Some obesity-related comorbidities including venous thromboembolism and heart disease can often require therapeutic anticoagulation. Previous small institutional studies have demonstrated that bariatric surgery can be performed in this patient population. This study attempts to identify best practices in stopping and restarting therapeutic anticoagulation in patients undergoing bariatric surgery. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was completed of our institution's database using anticoagulant medications to identify patients on therapeutic anticoagulation. Patients not on therapeutic anticoagulation were excluded, as well as patients that were started on therapeutic anticoagulation only in the post-operative period or those whose anticoagulation was stopped and not restarted. Indications for anticoagulation were recorded, as well as patient demographics and comorbid conditions. The patient chart was examined for when anticoagulation was stopped before surgery, when it was restarted after surgery, and whether or not the patient was therapeutically bridged. Baseline and post-operative hemoglobin values were recorded, as well as bleeding events, transfusions, reoperation, length of stay, and readmissions. Binary variables were compared across groups using Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests, and continuous variables were analyzed using T test. RESULTS: There were 2933 bariatric operations performed between January 1, 2012 and August 31, 2019. Of these patients, 64 were on therapeutic anticoagulation before and after the operation for one or more indications, including history of VTE (39), atrial fibrillation (27), clotting disorder (6), ventricular assist device (5), previous PCI (4), or mechanical valve (2). There were 4 (6.2%) patients that experienced bleeding events. All four patients were on Coumadin pre-operatively. Three patients experienced extraluminal bleeding, and one patient had intraluminal bleeding, and all events occurred within 72 h of the operation. All four patients had their anticoagulation restarted prior to the bleeding event becoming evident, with anticoagulation in these patients restarted an average of 1.25 days after surgery. There were no conditions that predisposed a patient to bleeding. There was no significant difference in amount of time anticoagulation was stopped before surgery in bleeding versus non-bleeding patients, and there appeared to be no increased risk of bleeding in patients that were on therapeutic bridging therapy. There were no thrombotic complications from the interruption in anticoagulation therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Bariatric surgery can be safely performed in patients on therapeutic anticoagulation, though this population is at greater risk for bleeding complications in the perioperative period. Meticulous hemostasis in the operating room is the most important aspect of preventing bleeding complications.  
Next-generation tissue-engineered heart valves with repair, remodelling and regeneration capacity.  ;Valvular heart disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Surgical valve repair or replacement has been the standard of care for patients with valvular heart disease for many decades, but transcatheter heart valve therapy has revolutionized the field in the past 15 years. However, despite the tremendous technical evolution of transcatheter heart valves, to date, the clinically available heart valve prostheses for surgical and transcatheter replacement have considerable limitations. The design of next-generation tissue-engineered heart valves (TEHVs) with repair, remodelling and regenerative capacity can address these limitations, and TEHVs could become a promising therapeutic alternative for patients with valvular disease. In this Review, we present a comprehensive overview of current clinically adopted heart valve replacement options, with a focus on transcatheter prostheses. We discuss the various concepts of heart valve tissue engineering underlying the design of next-generation TEHVs, focusing on off-the-shelf technologies. We also summarize the latest preclinical and clinical evidence for the use of these TEHVs and describe the current scientific, regulatory and clinical challenges associated with the safe and broad clinical translation of this technology.  
[Heyde syndrome successfully treated with transcatheter aortic valve implantation to prevent recurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding from angiodysplasia].  ;While hospitalized due to severe aortic stenosis, an 84-year-old woman developed repeated bleeding from angiodysplasia in the stomach leading to a diagnosis of Heyde syndrome. Following transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), there was no recurrence of bleeding from the angiodysplasia, and the decrease in von Willebrand factor levels that caused Heyde syndrome also improved. It was felt that the TAVI was able to prevent the recurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding due to angiodysplasia in Heyde syndrome.  
Clinical outcomes following balloon aortic valvuloplasty.  ;"BACKGROUND: Balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV) remains a treatment option for the selected patients with severe aortic stenosis. We examined clinical outcomes and predictors of prognosis in patients undergoing BAV for severe aortic stenosis. METHODS: We identified all patients undergoing BAV from January 2010 to March 2018 (n=167) at a single transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) centre. Patient demographics, investigations, subsequent interventions and clinical outcomes were obtained from electronic health records. RESULTS: Patients undergoing BAV were elderly (median age 80, IQR 73-86 years) and half (n=87, 52%) were male. All-cause mortality at 30 days and 12 months was 11% and 43%, respectively. Reduce ejection fraction (EF 30%-50%: HR 1.76, 95% CI 1.05 to 2.94; EF <30%: HR 1.90, 95% CI 1.12 to 3.20) was the only independent predictor at baseline of overall mortality. Median survival was 212 (IQR 54-490) days from the index procedure. Mortality at 1 year was lowest in patients who subsequently underwent TAVI or SAVR but high among those who had no further interventions or those who had a repeat BAV (14%, 19%, 60%, 89% respectively, log-rank p<0.001). CONCLUSION: BAV as a bridge to definitive aortic valve intervention in carefully selected patients offers acceptable outcomes. These contemporary observational findings demonstrate the ongoing potential utility of BAV in the TAVI era.  "
Golamari R(1), Bhattacharya PT(2).  ;Very little is known about tricuspid valve when compared to other valvular disorders, and tricuspid stenosis (TS) is even more rarely described. It most often co-exists with mitral valve pathology especially in patients with rheumatic heart disease  
Management of Valvular Disease During Pregnancy: Evolving Role of Percutaneous Treatment.  ;Valvular heart disease (VHD) is encountered in approximately 1% of pregnancies, significantly increasing both maternal and foetal risk. Rheumatic VHD remains the most common form in non-Western countries, whereas congenital heart disease dominates in the Western world. The risk of complications varies according to the type and severity of the underlying VHD. Moreover, pregnancy is a hypercoagulable state associated with increased risk of thromboembolism. The authors review the main VHDs encountered during pregnancy, and suggest management strategies based on the 2018 European Society of Cardiology recommendations for the management of pregnant women with VHD, providing an overview of classical and new transcatheter structural therapeutic options with a special focus on radiation exposure and anticoagulation drug management.  
Clinical Profile and Management of Rheumatic Heart Disease in Children and Young Adults at a Tertiary Cardiac Center in Indonesia.  ;"Introduction: Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) remains a major public health issue affecting children and young adults in developing countries. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics, management, and reactivation of RHD among children and young adults. Patients and Methods: This was a hospital-based retrospective study conducted at the National Cardiovascular Center Harapan Kita, Indonesia; we retrieved relevant data from patients diagnosed with RHD between 2012 and 2018. Results: Two hundred and seventy-nine patients were diagnosed with rheumatic heart disease, of whom 108 were children (mean age of 12.02 ± 3.36 years) and 171 were young adults (mean age was 24.9 ± 3.84). RHD was more common in female than in male young adults (1.5:1). Hospitalization due to RHD complications such as congestive heart failure was seen in 11.11% of cases in children, while pulmonary hypertension was present in 19.95% young adult cases. Reactivation of RHD occurred in 17.2% (48/279) cases, significantly in children (p < 0.001). Overall, the mitral valve (either isolated or combined) was the organ most affected in children (39.13%) and young adults (44.81%). Isolated mitral regurgitation was more common in children (13/21, 61.9%), while isolated mitral stenosis was more common in young adults (19/47, 40.42%). There was a high rate of rheumatic tricuspid valve disease in all populations (193/279, 69.17%) and reported involvement of pulmonary regurgitation (46/279, 16.48%). Multivalve lesions were more common than single lesions in both groups, with a combination of mitral and tricuspid regurgitation the predominant type in children (32/43, 74.41%) and mixed mitral lesion and tricuspid regurgitation in young adults (22/72, 30.56%). We observed a significant occurrence of quadrivalve lesions in children (p = 0.039). Valve repair was more common in children (49.07%) and replacement in young adults (32.16%), with low in-hospital mortality. Compliance with secondary prophylaxis was a significant challenge. Conclusion: Chronic RHD often presented with complications of the disease or reactivation of rheumatic fever (RF). Inadequate treatment of RF/RHD leads to extensive valvular damage and consequent disabilities. Efforts toward active early diagnosis and prompt treatment of RF/RHD and effective preventive measures are essential.  "
Impact of transcatheter aortic valve replacement on left ventricular hypertrophy, diastolic dysfunction and quality of life in patients with preserved left ventricular function.  ;Severe aortic stenosis (AS) is associated with left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction (LVDD). Due to positive impact on transvalvular hemodynamics, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is expected to improve LV remodeling, LVDD and heart failure (HF)-related quality-of-life (QoL). We identified patients with severe AS and LV ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ 50% who underwent TAVR. We reviewed pre-procedure, 1-month and 1-year post-TAVR transthoracic echocardiograms to assess LV volumetric changes and diastolic function. QoL was assessed by the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ). In 171 patients studied, we found significant improvement in LV mass index (LVMI), LV end-systolic diameter and LV end-diastolic diameter from baseline to 1-month to 1-year post-TAVR. Predictors of LVMI regression included greater change from baseline in mean aortic valve (AV) gradient, peak AV velocity, and improvements in septal and lateral e' velocities and E/e' post-TAVR. The percentage of patients with ≥ grade 2 LVDD decreased from 65% to 53% at 1-month and 49% at 1-year. A significant improvement in symptomatology, as reported by KCCQ score was also noted. There is conceivable reverse LV remodeling post-TAVR, impacted by improvements in mean AV gradient, peak AV velocity, E/e', medial and lateral e' velocities, which occurs immediately post-TAVR and persists up to 1-year post-operatively. This is associated with concomitant improvement in LVDD and HF-related QoL as demonstrated by KCCQ scores.  
Considerations for Optimal Device Selection in Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: A Review.  ;IMPORTANCE: Aortic valve stenosis (AS) is the most common manifestation of acquired valvular heart disease in developed countries. Several large-scale randomized clinical trials investigating the entire spectrum of patients with severe symptomatic AS from low to prohibitive risk have established transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) as a safe and effective alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement. OBSERVATIONS: There are currently only 3 types of TAVR devices commercially available in the US, but several other valve types are undergoing clinical trials in the US. Because of fundamental differences in engineering features, each TAVR device type has specific strengths and limitations. This review aims to provide an overview of design features and clinical outcomes of various TAVR devices that are either commercially available or undergoing clinical investigation. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Given the lack of large-scale head-to-head comparisons of various TAVR devices and the rapid development of new device iterations, there is insufficient evidence to claim superiority of one device type over another. Nonetheless, as each TAVR device has unique design characteristics, certain patient-related and anatomy-related factors may slightly favor one or several particular designs.  
Transcaval access for the emergency delivery of 5.0 liters per minute mechanical circulatory support in cardiogenic shock.  ;OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to describe the feasibility and early outcomes of transcaval access for delivery of emergency mechanical circulatory support (MCS) in cardiogenic shock. BACKGROUND: Vascular access for implantation of MCS in patients with cardiogenic shock is often challenging due to peripheral arterial disease and vasoconstriction. Transcaval delivery of MCS may be an alternative. We describe a series of patients we implanted an Impella 5.0 device, on-table without CT planning, through a percutaneous transcaval access route. METHODS: Ten patients with progressive or refractory cardiogenic shock underwent Impella 5.0 implantation via transcaval access. Demographic, clinical and procedural variables and in-hospital outcomes were collected. RESULTS: All ten underwent emergency implantation of the 7 mm diameter Impella 5.0 device via transcaval access. Six were women, with median age of 55.5 years (range, 29-69). Cardiogenic shock was attributed to idiopathic nonischemic cardiomyopathy (n = 4), myocarditis (n = 2), ischemic cardiomyopathy (n = 2), heart transplant rejection (n = 1), and unknown etiology (n = 1). Median duration of support was 92.1 hr (range, 21.2-165.4). Seven (70%) survived to device explant, with six (60%) surviving to access port closure and discharge. Among survivors, five recovered heart function and one received destination therapy left ventricular assist device. CONCLUSIONS: Transcaval access is feasible for emergency nonsurgical implantation of the Impella 5.0 device in cardiogenic shock with small or diseased iliofemoral arteries. This allows early institution of higher-flow MCS than conventional femoral artery implantation of the 3.5 L Impella CP device, and enables a bridge-to-recovery or bridge-to-destination strategy.  
Radiofrequency catheter ablation of premature ventricular contractions from the mitral annulus in patients without structural heart disease.  ;INTRODUCTION: We previously reported the clinical benefits of radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) of premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) from the right ventricular outflow tract or near the His-bundle, which can often deteriorate the clinical status. PVCs from the mitral valve (MA-PVCs) also often deteriorate the patients' clinical status. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of ablating MA-PVCs with RFCA from a trans-interatrial septal approach on the clinical status in symptomatic patients with frequent MA-PVCs without structural heart disease. METHODS: The frequency of PVCs per the total heart beats by 24-hours Holter monitoring and New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class in 22 patients with MA-PVCs were evaluated before and 6 months after RFCA. RESULTS: Procedural success was achieved in 20 (91%) of 22 patients. Of the 22 patients, in 15 (68%) and 1 (5%) patient, a successful RFCA on the left ventricular side of the MA using the trans-interatrial septal approach and trans-coronary sinus approach was achieved. Interestingly, in four (18%) patients, a successful RFCA on the left atrial (LA) side of the MA using a trans-interatrial septal approach was achieved. Ablating MA-PVCs readily improved the NYHA functional class compared to that before. A ≥0.62 peak deflection index and ≤30 years old may be one of the important predictors of successfully ablated MA-PVCs from the LA side of the MA. CONCLUSIONS: RFCA produces clinical benefits in patients with MA-PVCs. Further, it may be necessary to initially consider a trans-interatrial septal approach to ablate these PVCs.  
Double transcatheter balloon-expandable valve implantation for severe valve dysfunction in high-risk patients: initial experience.  ;"OBJECTIVES: Concomitant valvular heart valve disease is a frequent finding, with higher morbidity and mortality among patients undergoing redo surgical procedures. Our goal was to report our initial experience with combined transcatheter Inovare bioprosthesis implants for severe valve dysfunction. METHODS: Among 300 transcatheter procedures, a total of 6 patients had concurrent simultaneous transcatheter bioprosthesis implants for severe mitral bioprosthesis failure (valve-in-valve), with a second valve procedure that included native aortic (n = 2) or degenerated bioprostheses in the aortic position (n = 4). During the procedures, all patients were treated with a balloon-expandable Inovare transcatheter valve, using the transapical approach. RESULTS: Patients were highly symptomatic [New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class IV: 100%], with a mean age of 62 ± 5 years, yielding a mean European System for Cardiac Operative Risk II (EuroSCORE II) of 24.0 ± 10.1%. There was a mean of 1.6 ± 0.4 prior valve operations/patient, with a median time from prior mitral bioprosthesis surgery of 13.0 (9.2-20.0) years. Device success was 100% according to the Mitral Valve Academic Research Consortium and the Valve Academic Research Consortium-2 criteria. During the hospital stay, only 1 patient required dialysis, and the median intensive care unit and hospital lengths of stay were 5.0 (3.2-6.7) days and 16.0 (12.2-21.2) days, respectively. No deaths occurred at 30 days; at a median follow-up of 287 (194-437) days, 1 patient died of a non-cardiac cause and the rest of patients were in NYHA functional class I or II, with normofunctioning bioprostheses. CONCLUSIONS: Transcatheter double valve interventions using the Inovare bioprosthesis in this initial series were shown to be a reasonable alternative to redo surgical operations. The short- and mid-term clinical and echocardiographic outcomes demonstrate promising results, although future studies with a larger number of patients and longer follow-up are warranted.  "
Timing of intervention in asymptomatic patients with valvular heart disease.  ;Current management of valvular heart disease (VHD) seeks to optimize long-term outcome by timely intervention. Recommendations for treatment of patients with symptoms due to severe valvular disease are based on a foundation of solid evidence. However, when to intervene in asymptomatic patients remains controversial and decision requires careful individual weighing of the potential benefits against the risk of intervention and its long-term consequences. The primary rationale for earlier intervention is prevention of irreversible left ventricular (LV) myocardial changes that might result in later clinical symptoms and adverse cardiac events. A number of outcome predictors have been identified that facilitate decision-making. This review summarizes current recommendations and discusses recently published data that challenge them suggesting even earlier intervention. In adults with asymptomatic aortic stenosis (AS), emerging risk markers include very severe valve obstruction, elevated serum natriuretic peptide levels, and imaging evidence of myocardial fibrosis or increased extracellular myocardial volume. Currently, transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is not recommended for treatment of asymptomatic severe AS although this may change in the future. In patients with aortic regurgitation (AR), the potential benefit of early intervention in preventing LV dilation and dysfunction must be balanced against the long-term risk of a prosthetic valve, a particular concern because severe AR often occurs in younger patients with a congenital bicuspid valve. In patients with mitral stenosis, the option of transcatheter mitral balloon valvotomy tilts the balance towards earlier intervention to prevent atrial fibrillation, embolic events, and pulmonary hypertension. When chronic severe mitral regurgitation is due to mitral valve prolapse, anatomic features consistent with a high likelihood of a successful and durable valve repair favour early intervention. The optimal timing of intervention in adults with VHD is a constantly changing threshold that depends not only on the severity of valve disease but also on the safety, efficacy, and long-term durability of our treatment options.  
Case of calcific tricuspid and pulmonary valve stenosis.  ;Isolated right-sided valvular disease is a much less recognised entity when compared with left-sided valvular heart disease. Almost all the cases of combined pulmonary valve with tricuspid valve involvement are a consequence of underlying carcinoid heart disease. Moreover, severe calcification of tricuspid valve is an extremely unusual finding. We report a case of a severe calcific tricuspid valve stenosis along with severe pulmonary valve stenosis where the exact aetiology could not be established. On reviewing the literature, we did not find any reports describing such a morphology.  
Use of railway TM dilator as a novel technique to cross prosthetic aortic and mitral paravalvular leak.  ;Percutaneous endovascular repair of prosthetic paravalvular leaks (PVLs) has emerged as a safer, and less invasive option preferred for many patients. Crossing the PVL with a guide catheter (GC), or guide sheath is one of the challenging aspects of this technique and at times require arteriovenous (AV) rail creation. AV rail creation requires additional arterial access, snaring, and externalizing of a wire, all of which are associated with unique challenges and complications risk. Despite using these techniques, nearly 8% of the PVL closure procedures are unsuccessful. We report two cases with a novel technique of using a 0.035″ dilator from the Railway™, a radial sheathless access system, to successfully cross a guide catheter (GC) through difficult PVL when the traditional telescoping technique failed.  
Predictors and prognostic impact of nutritional changes after transcatheter aortic valve replacement.  ;"BACKGROUND: Little is known about changes in nutritional status as an index of frailty on clinical outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). This study aimed to assess the clinical impact of serum albumin changes after TAVR. METHODS: Changes in serum albumin levels from baseline to 1 year after TAVR were evaluated in 1524 patients who were classified as having hypoalbuminemia (<3.5 g/dl) and normoalbuminemia (≥3.5 g/dl) at each timepoint. The patients were categorized into 4 groups: NN (baseline normoalbuminemia, 1-year normoalbuminemia: n = 1119), HN (baseline hypoalbuminemia, 1-year normoalbuminemia: n = 202), NH (baseline normoalbuminemia, 1-year hypoalbuminemia: n = 121), and HH (baseline hypoalbuminemia, 1-year hypoalbuminemia: n = 82). We also defined late hypoalbuminemia as hypoalbuminemia identified at the 1-year assessment. Clinical outcomes were compared among 4 groups. Multivariable analysis was driven to assess the variables associated with late hypoalbuminemia and long-term mortality. RESULTS: The cumulative 3-year mortality was significantly different among the 4 groups (NN: 11.4%, HN: 10.7%, NH: 25.4%, HH: 44.4%, p < 0.001). Multivariable Cox regression analysis revealed that the NH group had a higher mortality risk (hazard ratio [HR]; 2.80 and 3.53, 95% confidence interval [CI]; 1.71-4.57 and 2.06-6.06, p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively), whereas the HN group had a similar risk (HR; 1.16, 95% CI; 0.66-2.06, p = 0.61) compared with the NN group. Baseline hypoalbuminemia, low body mass index, liver disease, peripheral artery disease, and hospital readmission within 1 year were predictors of late hypoalbuminemia (all p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Serial albumin assessment may identify poor prognostic subsets in patients with persistent and late acquired malnutrition after TAVR.  "
Pharmacokinetics of Repeated Oral Dosing with Coenzyme Q10 in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels with Myxomatous Mitral Valve Disease.  ;"Coenzyme Q10 (Q10) is a mitochondrial cofactor and an antioxidant with the potential to combat oxidative stress in heart failure. This study aims to determine the pharmacokinetics of repeated oral dosing of Q10 in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCS) with spontaneous myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) and to evaluate echocardiographic parameters, circulating cardiac biomarkers, and quality of life (QoL) after treatment. The study is a randomized, placebo-controlled, single-blinded crossover study. Nineteen CKCS with MMVD were randomized to receive 100 mg Q10 (ubiquinone) bi-daily for three weeks, then placebo (or in reverse order). Clinical examination, blood sampling, echocardiography, and QoL assessment were performed before and after each treatment phase. Q10 plasma concentrations were determined in plasma using a validated high-performance liquid chromatography method using electrochemical detection (HPLC-ECD). Eighteen CKCS were included in the analyses. Total plasma concentration of Q10 increased significantly (p < 0.0001) from baseline (median, 0.92 µg/mL; interquartile range (IQR), 0.70-1.26) to after treatment (median, 3.51 µg/mL; IQR, 2.30-6.88). Thirteen dogs reached the threshold of a total plasma Q10 concentration of ≥2.0 µg/mL. The average half-life (T1/2) of Q10 was 2.95 days (IQR, 1.75-4.02). No significant differences were observed in clinical MMVD severity, and the owner perceived QoL between Q10 and placebo treatment. The solubilized Q10 formulation was well-tolerated in the dogs. Individual variation in plasma concentrations was observed following oral treatment. A long-term placebo-controlled trial is warranted in dogs with MMVD to determine long-term efficacy on the clinical severity of MMVD.  "
Treatment to reduce vascular calcification in hemodialysis patients using vitamin K (Trevasc-HDK): A study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.  ;INTRODUCTION: End stage renal failure patients on hemodialysis have significant vascular calcification This is postulated to be related to sub-clinical vitamin K deficiency, which is prevalent in hemodialysis patients. Vitamin K deficiency result in the failure of the matrix GLA protein (MGP) to undergo carboxylation. MGP is a natural local inhibitor of vascular calcification and the lack of functional carboxylated MGP may contribute to increase vascular calcification. Vitamin K supplement should therefore correct this anomaly and decrease the rate or severity of vascular calcification in this population of patients on long-term maintenance hemodialysis. Our study seeks to evaluate the prevalence and the progression of vascular calcification in a cohort of maintenance hemodialysis patients. It will also evaluate the efficacy of vitamin K supplementation in reducing the progression of vascular calcification in this group of patients. METHODS: This will be a single-center randomized, prospective and open-label interventional clinical trial of end stage renal failure patients on hemodialysis. We aim to recruit 200 patients. Eligible patients will be randomized to either the standard care arm or active treatment arm. Active treatment arm patients will receive standard care plus supplementation with oral vitamin K2 isoform 360 mcg 3 times weekly for a total duration of 18 months. Primary outcome measured will be absolute difference in coronary artery calcification score at 18-month between control and intervention arms. Secondary outcomes will be to compare absolute difference in aortic valve calcification, percentage of patients with regression of coronary artery calcification of at least 10%, absolute difference in aortic and systemic arterial stiffness, mortality from any cause and major adverse cardiovascular over the same period. DISCUSSION: Evidence of successful regression or retardation of vascular calcification will support the conduct of larger and longer-term trials aimed at reducing cardiovascular disease mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events in this high-risk population using a safe and inexpensive strategy TRIAL REGISTRATION:: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02870829.

Percutaneous mitral valve repair in adults with congenital heart disease: Report of the first case-series.  ;"BACKGROUND: Systemic atrioventricular valve regurgitation (AVVR) is frequently encountered in adults with congenital heart disease (CHD). Surgical intervention is the mainstay of therapy, but in a specific high-risk subset, percutaneous valve repair might offer a lower-risk alternative. METHODS: Three patients with complex CHD and severe symptomatic AVVR underwent percutaneous mitral valve repair at a single center. All were deemed to be high-risk for surgery by a multidisciplinary CHD team and provided informed consent for the compassionate use of the MitraClip (Abbott, Santa Clara, CA). Three-dimensional heart models were generated for the procedure, which was performed by an adult CHD cardiologist (who provided imaging support) and an interventional cardiologist with expertise in CHD and percutaneous mitral valve repair. RESULTS: The first case was a 39 year-old-woman with [S,L,D] dextrocardia, double outlet right ventricle, mild tricuspid hypoplasia, and a secundum atrial septal defect, who was palliated at age 35 with a right bidirectional Glenn and later developed severe, symptomatic mitral regurgitation, and underwent placement of one MitraClip XTR device. Two patients with L-loop transposition of the great arteries each successfully underwent placement of two MitraClip XTR devices; one patient had a single-leaflet detachment of one of the clips with no change in regurgitation or clip position on follow-up. All patients had significant reduction of AVVR and improvement in NYHA functional class. CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous atrioventricular valve repair in adults with CHD is feasible with the MitraClip but requires significant preprocedural planning and a multidisciplinary team that combines CHD and interventional therapeutic expertise.

Differential gene expression in patients with primary mitral valve disease: identifying potential therapeutic targets in the era of precision medicine.  ;Primary (degenerative) mitral valve (MV) disease is a result of structural remodeling due to degenerative and adaptive changes of MV tissue. We hypothesized that in patients with primary MV disease undergoing surgery for severe mitral regurgitation (MR), a distinct genetic expression profile within the MV leaflet tissue could be identified as compared with patients without MV disease. Tissue samples from the MV leaflets of 65 patients undergoing MV surgery for MR due to primary MV disease and 4 control cadavers without MV disease were collected and analyzed. MicroRNA transcripts were hybridized to Illumina HumanHT-12 v4 Beadchips. Ingenuity pathway analyses (IPAs) were conducted to provide biological interpretation. Of the approximately 20 000 genes examined, 4092 (20%) were differentially expressed between patients with primary MV disease and normal controls (false discovery rate<0.05). The differentially expressed genes could be clustered into five regulator effect networks from the Ingenuity Knowledge IPA database with a consistency score of >6. These five networks have been previously implicated in pathophysiological cardiac abnormalities, including inhibited contractility of the heart and fatty acid oxidation as well as activation of apoptosis of smooth muscle cells, cardiac degeneration, and hypertrophy of cardiac cells. MV tissue in patients with primary MV disease demonstrated distinct genetic expression patterns as compared with normal controls. Further studies are necessary to determine whether the molecular pathways identified in this experiment may represent potential therapeutic targets to prevent degeneration of MV tissue leading to severe MR.  
Dimensionless index of the mitral valve for evaluation of degenerative mitral stenosis.  ;PURPOSE: Degenerative mitral stenosis (DMS) is an increasingly recognized cause of mitral stenosis. The goal of this study was to compare echocardiographic differences between DMS and rheumatic mitral stenosis (RMS), identify echocardiographic variables reflective of DMS severity, and propose a dimensionless mitral stenosis index (DMSI) for assessment of DMS severity. METHODS: This is a single-center, retrospective cohort study. We included patients with at least mild MS and a mean transmitral pressure gradient (TMPG) ≥4 mm Hg. Mitral valve area by the continuity equation (MVACEQ ) was used as an independent reference. The DMSI was calculated as follows: DMSI = VTILVOT / VTIMV. All-cause mortality data were collected retrospectively. RESULTS: A total of 64 patients with DMS and 24 patients with RMS were identified. MVACEQ was larger in patients with DMS (1.43 ± 0.4 cm2 ) than RMS (0.9 ± 0.3 cm2 ) by ~0.5 cm2 (P = <.001), and mean TMPG was lower in the DMS group (6.0 ± 2 vs 7.9 ± 3 mm Hg, P = .003). A DMSI of ≤0.50 and ≤0.351 was associated with MVACEQ ≤1.5 and MVACEQ ≤1.0 cm2 (P < .001), respectively. With the progression of DMS from severe to very severe, there was a significant drop in DMSI. There was a nonsignificant trend toward worse survival in patients with MVACEQ ≤1.0 cm2 and DMSI ≤0.35, suggesting severe stenosis severity. CONCLUSION: Our results show that TMPG correlates poorly with MVA in patients with DMS. Proposed DMSI may serve as a simple echocardiographic indicator of hemodynamically significant DMS.  
Renin-Angiotensin System Blockade in Aortic Stenosis: Implications Before and After Aortic Valve Replacement.  ;Aortic stenosis (AS) is a common valvular heart disease in the aging population that is characterized by a variable period of asymptomatic phase before development of symptoms and severe AS. Mortality and morbidity is substantial even after aortic valve replacement, in part related to persistent left ventricular hypertrophy, diastolic dysfunction, and heart failure. Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockade therapy is associated with modulation of adverse left ventricular remodeling, reduction in myocardial hypertrophy, and fibrosis, resulting in clinical improvements in patients with congestive heart failure There are emerging data to suggest benefit of RAS blockade in patients with AS before and after AVR with regard to potentially slower progression of aortic valve calcification, left ventricular mass and survival benefit in favor of RAS blockade group before AVR, and also survival benefit in patients after AVR. We review the available data to understand the role of RAS blockade before AVR and in patients undergoing surgical AVR and transcatheter AVR. There are significant survival advantages of RAS inhibition in patients with AS undergoing surgical AVR or transcatheter AVR. On the basis of existing literature, adequately powered randomized trials are needed to evaluate the role of RAS inhibition in patients with AS.  
Impact of Appropriate Use Criteria for Transthoracic Echocardiography in Valvular Heart Disease on Clinical Outcomes.  ;"BACKGROUND: The association between appropriate use criteria for transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and clinical outcomes is unknown for patients with valvular heart disease (VHD). The aim of this study was to identify the association of TTE appropriateness with downstream cardiac tests and clinical outcomes in patients with VHD over 365 days. METHODS: A subset of 2,297 patients with VHD across six Ontario academic hospitals was selected from the Echo WISELY (Will Inappropriate Scenarios for Echocardiography Lessen Significantly) trial and linked to administrative databases. Each patient's index TTE was classified as ""rarely appropriate"" (rA) versus ""appropriate"" (comprising ""appropriate"" and ""may be appropriate"" TTE according to the 2011 appropriate use criteria). Overall, 431 of 452 patients with rA TTE were matched 1:1 with patients with appropriate TTE using propensity scores to account for measured confounding. RESULTS: Matched patients with rA TTE were less likely to undergo repeat TTE (relative risk, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.33-0.66) or cardiac catheterization (relative risk, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.16-0.47) at 90 days compared with patients with appropriate TTE. rA TTE was significantly associated with a decreased hazard of aortic valve intervention (hazard ratio, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.14-0.42), all-cause hospitalization (hazard ratio, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.34-0.57), and death (hazard ratio, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.15-0.66) over 365 days of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with appropriate TTE for VHD were more likely to undergo subsequent cardiac testing within 90 days and valve intervention within 1 year than those with a rA TTE. The 2011 appropriate use criteria for TTE have important clinical implications for outcomes in patient with VHD.  "
Brown KN(1), Lee L, Kanmanthareddy A(2).  ;Aortic valve disease, specifically aortic valve stenosis, is one of the most common valvular disorders in the United States and worldwide. While traditional aortic valve replacement via open heart surgery was historically the preferred--and only--definitive treatment option, transcatheter therapy now plays a significant role. Since the first reported case of transcather aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in a human in 2002, TAVR has evolved rapidly and now has become the preferred first-line treatment option for many patients with aortic stenosis.  While the earliest TAVR patients were those deemed either prohibitive or very high risk for surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR), the use of TAVR has expanded to include those who are intermediate and low risk. The evolution has TAVR has encountered numerous pitfalls and technical modifications that have improved safety and efficacy.  Landmark trials including the PARTNER 1 and PARTNER 2 studies have demonstrated the benefits of TAVR compared to medical management and SAVR. We describe here an overview of TAVR for aortic valve stenosis.  
Leadless pacemaker for patients following cardiac valve intervention.  ;"BACKGROUND: Permanent pacing is common after valve intervention. The presence of a conventional pacemaker in this population is recognized as a risk factor for infectious events. Therefore, a leadless pacing system could be the preferred strategy when permanent pacing is required after valve intervention. AIM: To report periprocedural outcomes and follow-up of patients undergoing implantation of a leadless pacing system after valve intervention. METHODS: Patients with previous valve intervention at the time of attempted implantation of a leadless pacemaker (Micra™, Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA) were included, and were compared with a control group (patients also implanted with Micra™ without valve intervention). RESULTS: Among a total of 170 Micra™ implantation procedures, 54 patients (31.8%) had a history of valve intervention: 28 after aortic valve replacement; 10 after mitral valve replacement; one after single tricuspid valvuloplasty; and 15 after multiple valve surgery. Median age of the patients was 82.5 (77.0-86.0) years and 53.7% were male. Patients with previous valve intervention had a higher incidence of arterial hypertension (P=0.014) and ischaemic heart disease (P=0.040). The primary indications for permanent pacing after valve intervention were high-degree atrioventricular block (59.3%) and atrial fibrillation with bradycardia (27.8%). Micra™ was successfully implanted in all patients (n=170) without any procedure-related major complications. During a median follow-up of 12 months, electrical performance was excellent and similar in both groups. Also, a similar reduction in left ventricular ejection fraction was observed at 12 months in both groups, which was correlated with the percentage of right ventricular pacing. CONCLUSION: A leadless pacemaker is safe and efficient after valve intervention, and therefore represents an effective pacing option in patients after valve intervention.  "

Outcomes of percutaneous mitral valve repair in systolic versus diastolic congestive heart failure.  ;INTRODUCTION: Percutaneous mitral valve repair with MitraClip device has been approved for treatment of mitral regurgitation in symptomatic patients deemed high risk for surgical repair. This study compares outcomes of Mitraclip in patients with systolic (SHF) versus diastolic heart failure (DHF). METHODS: The study population was extracted from the 2016 Nationwide Readmissions Data (NRD) using International Classification of Diseases, tenth edition, clinical modifications/procedure coding system (ICD-9-CM/PCS) codes for the Mitraclip, SHF, DHF, and procedural complications. Study endpoints included in-hospital all-cause mortality, cardiogenic shock, acute myocardial infarction (AMI), acute kidney injury (AKI), stroke, acute respiratory failure, bleeding, blood transfusion, length of hospital stay (LOS) as well as 30-day readmission rate. RESULTS: A total of 1681 discharges that had Mitraclip during the index hospitalization and had a history of SHF (909) or DHF (772) were included in this analysis. The mean age was 78.5 years and 46.6% were female. SHF group was associated with higher post-procedural cardiogenic shock (7.3% versus 2.0%, p < 0.01), AMI (2.1% versus 0.8%, p = 0.03), AKI (21.0 versus 14.2%, p < 0.01), acute respiratory failure (13.2% versus 9.6%, p = 0.02), and longer LOS (9.6 versus 5.7 days, p < 0.01). There were no significant differences between groups in terms of in-hospital all-cause mortality (3.4% versus 2.3%, p = 0.18), stroke (0.7% versus 1.4%, p = 0.15), bleeding (10.7% versus 8.9%, p = 0.23), need for blood transfusion (5.7% versus 3.6%, p = 0.05), or 30-day readmission rate (15.7% versus 16.1%, p = 0.86). CONCLUSIONS: In comparison to DHF, patients with SHF undergoing the MitraClip had higher in-hospital morbidities and longer LOS but comparable mortality and 30-day readmission rates.  
Long-term experience with the one-and-a-half ventricle repair for simple and complex congenital heart defects.  ;"OBJECTIVES: The one-and-a-half ventricle repair (1.5VR) is a surgical alternative to Fontan circulation or high-risk biventricular repair in patients with complex congenital heart disease (CHD) with a hypoplastic right ventricle (RV). We report our 25 years of experience to evaluate whether the degree of anatomical complexity of the CHD can affect long-term outcomes. METHODS: This is a retrospective study including patients undergoing 1.5VR between 1994 and 2018. Clinical records and operative reports were reviewed. Follow-up data were collected from all survivors at the last evaluation or by phone contact. RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients underwent 1.5VR [median age: 3.5 years, interquartile range (IQR) 0.8-7.8]. Fifteen patients had 'simple' (i.e. confined to right heart lesions) anatomical characteristics (48.3%); the median tricuspid valve annulus z-score was -3.5 (IQR -6.2 to +3.6). There were no operative deaths. The median hospital stay was 21 days (IQR 10-33), with postoperative complications in 21 patients (75.8%). At a median follow-up of 13.2 years (IQR 3.2-25.6 years; completeness 96.6%), there were 3 late deaths. There was no significant difference in survival and in freedom from adverse events between simple and complex anatomy groups. However, stress test findings showed a tendency towards a higher maximum oxygen uptake in the simple group (P = 0.055). CONCLUSIONS: The 1.5VR strategy is an effective low-risk surgical option for patients with CHD with hypoplastic RV. When it is planned from birth, late outcomes can be satisfactory. In our experience, the presence of associated major cardiac anomalies was not associated with either worse early or long-term outcomes and functional status.  "
Pre-procedural computed tomography in transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement: The first steps towards standardization of image quality.  ;DOI: 10.1016/j.ijcha.2020.100542 PMCID: PMC7452673 PMID: 32885028  
Computed tomography guided sizing for transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement.  ;"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the predictive value of Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) measurements of the RVOT for transcatheter valve sizing. BACKGROUND: Transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement (TPVR) provides an alternative to surgery in patients with right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) dysfunction. We studied 18 patients who underwent catheterization for potential TPVR to determine whether CT imaging can be used to accurately predict implant size. METHODS: Cases were grouped by RVOT characteristics: native or transannular patch (n = 8), conduit (n = 5) or bioprosthetic valve (n = 5). TPVR was undertaken in 14/18 cases, after balloon-sizing was used to confirm suitability and select implant size. Retrospective CT measurements of the RVOT (circumference-derived (Dcirc) and area-derived (Darea) diameters) were obtained at the level of the annulus, bioprosthesis or conduit. Using manufacturer sizing guidance, a valve size was generated and a predicted valve category assigned: (1) <18 mm, (2) 18-20 mm, (3) 22-23 mm, (4) 26-29 mm and (5) >29 mm. Predicted and implanted valves were compared for inter-rater agreement using Cohen's kappa coefficient. RESULTS: The median age of patients was 37 years old (IQR: 30-49); 55% were male. Diagnoses included: Tetralogy of Fallot (12/18), d-Transposition repair (3/18), congenital pulmonary stenosis (2/18) and carcinoid heart disease (1/18). Measurements of Darea (κ = 0.697, p < 0.01) and Dcirc (κ = 0.540, p < 0.01) were good predictors of implanted valve size. When patients with RVOT conduits were excluded, the predictive accuracy improved for Darea (κ = 0.882, p < 0.01) and Dcirc (κ = 0.882, p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: CT measurement of the RVOT, using Darea or Dcirc, can predict prosthetic valve sizing in TPVR. These measurements are less predictive in patients with conduits, compared to those with a native RVOT or pulmonic bioprosthesis. CONDENSED ABSTRACT: We studied 18 patients who underwent catheterization for TPVR to determine whether CT imaging could be used to accurately predict implant size. Retrospective RVOT measurements were used to generate a predicted valve size, which was compared with implanted valve size for inter-rater agreement. Measurements of Darea (κ = 0.697, p < 0.01) and Dcirc (κ = 0.540, p < 0.01) were good predictors of implanted valve size. When cases with RVOT conduits were excluded, the predictive accuracy improved for Darea (κ = 0.882, p < 0.01) and Dcirc (κ = 0.882, p < 0.01). CT measurement of the RVOT can accurately predict prosthetic valve sizing in TPVR. These measurements are less predictive in patients with conduits.  "
"Early detachment of prosthetic aortic valve one year after replacement for severe aortic regurgitation due to perforated aortic valve aneurysm; a case of suspected HLA-B52 positive Behçet's disease.  ";"Herein, we report a case of 61-year-old male with congestive heart failure (HF) due to severe aortic regurgitation (AR) caused by ruptured aortic valve aneurysm (VA). Aortic valve replacement (AVR) was performed after improvement of HF symptoms. Pathological examination of resected aortic VA showed neutrophil infiltration. Although he did not have typical clinical features associated with infective endocarditis (IE) such as fever, leukocytosis, or positive blood culture, we misdiagnosed this case as ""concealed IE"". However, we reconsidered the etiology because prosthetic aortic valve detachment occurred only one year after AVR. When considering causes except IE for perforated aortic VA and early prosthetic valve detachment, Behçet's disease (BD) was more likely based on the clinical course, echocardiography, and pathological findings in this case. The inflammatory process of BD is associated with aortic valvulitis/aortitis, leading to a possible cause of aortic regurgitation due to aortic VA or early prosthetic valve detachment. The diagnosis of BD was challenging in this case because he did not have predominant clinical findings, including recurrent oral ulcer which is a mandatory criterion for the diagnosis by the International Study Group, however, cardiac involvement may have been the initial presentation of BD. <Leaning objective: Aortic valve aneurysm and its rupture are rare and most cases are caused by infective endocarditis (IE). However, if there is no typical clinical feature of IE including fever, leukocytosis, or positive blood culture in such case, Behçet's disease BD should be considered even if there are no predominant clinical findings including recurrent oral ulcer. Appropriate immunosuppressive therapy and modification of surgical techniques for the possible cardiac involvement may improve prognosis in patients with BD.>.  "
General population screening for atrial fibrillation with an automated rhythm-detection blood pressure device.  ;BACKGROUND: Screening strategies to diagnose previously undetected atrial fibrillation (AF), especially silent AF (SAF), in at-risk populations may help reduce the number of strokes. We prospectively assessed the incidence rate of AF, including SAF, using an automated AF-detection capable sphygmomanometer in the General Practitioner (GP) setting. METHODS: This was a population-based prospective study of unselected general population of ≥65 years without prior AF. Participating GPs were requested, in the period February 2018-April 2019, to record all AF diagnoses including those derived from the AF-detection capable sphygmomanometer and confirmed by 12‑lead ECG or ECG Holter in asymptomatic patients. RESULTS: Overall, 14,987 patients assisted by 76 GPs accumulated 16,838 patient-years of follow up. The incidence rate of AF was 2.25% patient-years (95%CI 2.03-2.48). AF was more frequently detected in male, older, overweight, and patients with prior stroke, congestive heart failure, and chronic kidney disease. One in four patients had device-detected SAF (0.56% patient-years, 95%CI 0.46-0.69). Age, overweight, and the number of annual visits, were independent predictors of both SAF and AF. In addition, congestive heart failure, mitral valve disease were independent predictors of AF. Due to the interaction between blood pressure and age the risk of AF increased exponentially after 75 years of age in patients with higher systolic blood pressure values. CONCLUSION: We found a higher than previously reported incidence rate of AF possibly by capturing SAF. Our simple protocol might be feasible in large-scale screening for AF and SAF in routine GP care.  
Combined Aortic and Mitral Annular Enlargement with Fibrous Skeleton Reconstruction.  ;In pediatric population, congenital or acquired disease of the aortic and mitral valves may co-exist and sometimes require replacement of both valves. Enlargement of aortic and mitral annuli may also be required. We demonstrate a challenging case that required upsizing of both prosthetic valves by re-do anterior aorto-ventriculoplasty and patch enlargement of aortic-mitral fibrous body. This case highlights the complexity and feasibility of enlarging both annuli, in a re-operative setting, to implant larger prostheses.  
Similarity measures and attribute selection for case-based reasoning in transcatheter aortic valve implantation.  ;In a clinical decision support system, the purpose of case-based reasoning is to help clinicians make convenient decisions for diagnoses or interventional gestures. Past experience, which is represented by a case-base of previous patients, is exploited to solve similar current problems using four steps-retrieve, reuse, revise, and retain. The proposed case-based reasoning has been focused on transcatheter aortic valve implantation to respond to clinical issues pertaining vascular access and prosthesis choices. The computation of a relevant similarity measure is an essential processing step employed to obtain a set of retrieved cases from a case-base. A hierarchical similarity measure that is based on a clinical decision tree is proposed to better integrate the clinical knowledge, especially in terms of case representation, case selection and attributes weighting. A case-base of 138 patients is used to evaluate the case-based reasoning performance, and retrieve- and reuse-based criteria have been considered. The sensitivity for the vascular access and the prosthesis choice is found to 0.88 and 0.94, respectively, with the use of the hierarchical similarity measure as opposed to 0.53 and 0.79 for the standard similarity measure. Ninety percent of the suggested solutions are correctly classified for the proposed metric when four cases are retrieved. Using a dedicated similarity measure, with relevant and weighted attributes selected through a clinical decision tree, the set of retrieved cases, and consequently, the decision suggested by the case-based reasoning are substantially improved over state-of-the-art similarity measures.  
Prenatal diagnosis of double-outlet right ventricle with tricuspid valve atresia, anomalous pulmonary vein connection, persistent left superior vena cava, and right atrial isomerism.  ;Double-outlet right ventricle is a conotruncal cardiac disease in which both the aorta and the pulmonary artery predominantly or completely originate from the right ventricle.

Congenital bicuspid aortic valve: Differential prevalence across different South African population groups.  ;DOI: 10.7196/SAMJ.2020.v110i8.14854 PMID: 32880286 [Indexed for MEDLINE]  
"[Septal Myectomy for Obstructive Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Due to Noonan Syndrome;Report of a Case].  ";A 15-year-old boy with Noonan syndrome, who had been diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) at 4 and treated by drugs, was referred to our hospital because of progression of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO). Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed left ventricular hypertrophy( LVH), LVOTO( systolic gradient:102 mmHg), and systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve( SAM) with mild mitral regurgitation(MR). We performed septal myectomy by transaortic and transapical approaches. Postoperative TTE revealed significant reduction in left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradient (9 mmHg), resolution of SAM, and reduction in MR grade. The postoperative course was uneventful except for transient atrial tachyarrhythmia. Myectomy for HCM in a patient with Noonan syndrome is rare. This case suggests that myectomy is useful for the patients with Noonan syndrome.  
"[Refractory Lower Leg Ulcers with Giant Aortic Aneurysm Accompanied with Chronic Stanford Type A Aortic Dissection and Severe Aortic Regurgitation;Report of a Case].  ";A 54-year-old male presented with severe aortic regurgitation. Physical examination showed severely infected lower leg ulcers(LLU). Giant aortic aneurysm( 110 mm) with Stanford type A aortic dissection was revealed by computed tomography. We treated his infected legs first and on the 22nd day he underwent modified Bentall operation. Postoperative course was uneventful and he moved to other hospital for skin grafting of the lower extremities. Pathological study showed no specific change in the aorta.  
[A Giant Papillary Fibroelastoma in the Right Ventricle].  ;Papillary fibroelastoma (PFE) accounts for approximately 8% of benign primary cardiac tumors. PFE frequently develops in the left heart system, such as the aortic valve and the mitral valve. We report a case of a giant PFE in the right ventricle. The patient was an 83-year-old woman with a history of chronic atrial fibrillation, diabetes, and hypertension. She had experienced palpitation and shortness of breath for several years. A giant mobile tumor was observed in the right ventricle by transthoracic echocardiography, and its extirpation was performed. Intraoperatively, a giant tumor of 3 cm in diameter was observed on the right ventricular side of the posterior tricuspid leaflet. As the tumor strongly adhered to the tendinous cords, it was unavoidable to resect the tendinous cords. Thus, a tricuspid valve repair was performed in addition to the tumor extirpation. The patient was diagnosed with papillary fibroelastoma by pathological examination.  
"[Bronchial Occlusion with Endobronchial Watanabe Spigot for Massive Pulmonary Hemorrhage during Heart Surgery;Report of a Case].  ";Massive pulmonary hemorrhage, although rare, is a potentially life-threatening complications during heart surgery. We herein present 1 such case successfully treated by selective bronchial occlusion using an Endobronchial Watanabe Spigot (EWS). The 82-year-old female underwent mitral valve replacement, tricuspid annuloplasty, and maze procedure. An hour and a half after cessation of cardiopulmonary bypass, the patient suffered a massive pulmonary hemorrhage. A subsequent bronchoscopy identified the hemorrhage site at the right middle lobe bronchus (B5b), and an EWS was then selectively deployed into this bronchus to block the hemorrhage. The following day, bronchial arterial embolization was performed, enabling the removal of the spigot on the next day. The patient's respiratory condition gradually improved, allowing for extubation on the 21st postoperative day. By preventing bleeding into neighboring bronchi, which, in turn, avoids the risk of exacerbating hypoxia, bronchial occlusion with EWSs is highly effective in managing massive pulmonary hemorrhage during heart surgery.  
Sudden Unexpected Death of Infantile Dilated Cardiomyopathy with JPH2 and PKD1 Gene Variants.  ;A Japanese girl with polycystic kidney disease (PKD) developed normally, but at 8 months of age, she was hospitalized for acute onset dyspnea. On the day after admission to hospital, her general condition suddenly became worse. An echocardiogram showed left ventricular dilatation with thin walls, severe mitral valve regurgitation, and a reduced ejection fraction. She died of acute cardiac failure 3 hours after the sudden change. Postmortem analysis with light microscopy showed disarray of cardiomyocytes without obvious infiltration of lymphocytes, and we diagnosed her heart failure as idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Clinical exome sequencing showed compound heterozygous variants in JPH2 (p.T237A/p.I414L) and a heterozygous nonsense mutation in PKD1 (p.Q4193*). To date, several variants in the JPH2 gene have been reported to be pathogenic for adult-onset hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or DCM in an autosomal dominant manner and infantile-onset DCM in an autosomal recessive manner. Additionally, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is a systemic disease associated with several extrarenal manifestations, such as cardiomyopathy. Here we report a sudden infant death case of DCM and discuss the genetic variants of DCM and PKD.  
Does Quicker Mean Better? Comparison of Rapid Deployment Versus Conventional Aortic Valve Replacement.  ;"The aim of this meta-analysis was to compare the clinical outcomes in patients who underwent rapid deployment aortic valve replacement (RDAVR) and conventional bio prosthetic aortic valve replacement (CAVR).We performed a literature search by August 2018. The primary outcomes were hospital and 1-year mortality, and the secondary endpoints included the aortic cross-clamp (ACC), cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) time, and postoperative and valve-related complications.Two randomized controlled trials and 13 propensity score-matched studies were included. There was no difference between RDAVR and CAVR in hospital mortality (2.5% versus 2.1%; risk ratio (RR) 1.16 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80-1.68]) or 1-year mortality (2.9% versus 4.1%; RR 0.69 [95% CI 0.34-1.34]). RDAVR significantly reduced the ACC time ( (mean difference (MD) -24.33 [95% CI -28.35 to -20.32]) and CPB time (MD -21.51 [95% CI -22.83 to -20.20]). The pooled analysis showed that RDAVR doubled the occurrence of permanent pacemaker implantation (8.6% versus 4.3%; RR 2.05 [95% CI 1.62-2.60]). Meanwhile, the blood transfusion amount (MD -1.54 [95% CI -2.22 to -0.86]) and postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) occurrence (RR 0.83 [95% CI 0.69-0.99]) was reduced. The difference of paravalvular leakage frequency between RDAVR and CAVR was marginal (RR 1.77 [95% CI 1.00-3.17]; P = 0.05). Furthermore, RDAVR was related to larger valves (MD 0.70 cm [95% CI 0.33-1.07]) and lower mean pressure gradients (MD -1.93 mmHg [95% CI -3.58 to -0.28]).The hospital and 1-year survival rates between RDAVR and CAVR are comparable. RDAVR reduces POAF occurrence and blood transfusion but is associated with a higher occurrence of pacemaker implantation.  "
[A Case of Change from Normal-flow High-pressure Gradient Severe Aortic Stenosis to Paradoxical Low-flow Low-pressure Gradient Severe Aortic Stenosis].  ;We report a case of a 77-year-old male who had been diagnosed with normal-flow high-pressure gradient severe aortic stenosis (AS) two years previously. In accordance with his wishes, it was decided not to perform surgery. He visited our hospital with anorexia and weight loss and was diagnosed with gastric cancer. Echocardiography showed a change to paradoxical low-flow low-pressure gradient severe AS (PLFLPG AS). A decrease in stroke volume is typically associated with a smaller LV size, but the reason for a smaller LV size in PLFLPG AS remains unclear. In this case, the change to PLFLPG AS was thought to be due to a decrease in whole body oxygen consumption, and this may help to understand the pathology.  
Identification of CD34+/PGDFRα+ Valve Interstitial Cells (VICs) in Human Aortic Valves: Association of Their Abundance, Morphology and Spatial Organization with Early Calcific Remodeling.  ;"Aortic valve interstitial cells (VICs) constitute a heterogeneous population involved in the maintenance of unique valvular architecture, ensuring proper hemodynamic function but also engaged in valve degeneration. Recently, cells similar to telocytes/interstitial Cajal-like cells described in various organs were found in heart valves. The aim of this study was to examine the density, distribution, and spatial organization of a VIC subset co-expressing CD34 and PDGFRα in normal aortic valves and to investigate if these cells are associated with the occurrence of early signs of valve calcific remodeling. We examined 28 human aortic valves obtained upon autopsy. General valve morphology and the early signs of degeneration were assessed histochemically. The studied VICs were identified by immunofluorescence (CD34, PDGFRα, vimentin), and their number in standardized parts and layers of the valves was evaluated. In order to show the complex three-dimensional structure of CD34+/PDGFRα+ VICs, whole-mount specimens were imaged by confocal microscopy, and subsequently rendered using the Imaris (Bitplane AG, Zürich, Switzerland) software. CD34+/PDGFRα+ VICs were found in all examined valves, showing significant differences in the number, distribution within valve tissue, spatial organization, and morphology (spherical/oval without projections; numerous short projections; long, branching, occasionally moniliform projections). Such a complex morphology was associated with the younger age of the subjects, and these VICs were more frequent in the spongiosa layer of the valve. Both the number and percentage of CD34+/PDGFRα+ VICs were inversely correlated with the age of the subjects. Valves with histochemical signs of early calcification contained a lower number of CD34+/PDGFRα+ cells. They were less numerous in proximal parts of the cusps, i.e., areas prone to calcification. The results suggest that normal aortic valves contain a subpopulation of CD34+/PDGFRα+ VICs, which might be involved in the maintenance of local microenvironment resisting to pathologic remodeling. Their reduced number in older age could limit the self-regenerative properties of the valve stroma.  "
Infective endocarditis by Acinetobacter species: a systematic review.  ;A. baumannii - A. calcoaceticus complex infections are increasingly frequent, especially in intensive care units. Such infections are associated with a mortality that can be as high as 62%. On the other hand, infective endocarditis (IE) is an uncommon disease with notable morbidity and mortality. Even though IE is rarely caused by Acinetobacter species, these infections can be particularly problematic due to increasing antimicrobial resistance. The purpose of this study was to systemically review all published cases of IE by Acinetobacter species in the literature. A systematic review of PubMed, Scopus and Cochrane library (through 25 April 2020) for studies providing epidemiological, clinical, microbiological as well as treatment data and outcomes of IE by Acinetobacter species was performed. A total of 35 studies, containing data of 37 patients, were included. A prosthetic valve was present in 40.5%, while the most common causative pathogen was A. baumannii - A. calcoaceticus complex, followed by A. lwoffii. Aortic valve was the commonest infected site, followed by mitral valve. Diagnosis was set with transthoracic echocardiography in 48.6%, while the diagnosis was set at autopsy in 20%. Fever and sepsis were the commonest clinical presentations, followed by heart failure and embolic phenomena. Aminoglycosides, cephalosporins and carbapenems were the commonest antimicrobials used. Clinical cure was noted in 70.3%, while overall mortality was 32.4%. Development of heart failure was independently associated with mortality by IE. This systematic review thoroughly describes IE by Acinetobacter and provides information on epidemiology, clinical presentation, treatment and outcomes.

Survival and long-term outcomes after concomitant mitral and aortic valve replacement in patients with rheumatic heart disease.  ;INTRODUCTION: Double valve replacement (DVR) with a mechanical prosthesis is associated with a higher risk of mortality. We planned to study the survival rate, early and late mortality and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) in patients undergoing DVR for rheumatic heart disease, with various generations of prosthetic valves ranging from ball in cage to bileaflet prosthesis and tilting disc valves. MATERIALS AND METHODOLOGY: We followed up 277 patients with rheumatic heart disease who underwent DVR between August 1999 and November 2009, retrospectively, at Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology, Thiruvananthapuram. Two hundred and fifty-nine patients were followed up for a minimum period of 10 years, and the follow-up period varied between 10 and 20 years. Eighteen patients were lost to follow-up after the surgery and could not be contacted. Their data was included till the time they appeared for follow-up last, for survival analysis. Survival analysis was carried out using the life table method to calculate the freedom from reoperation, survival rates and freedom from MACCE at 1 year, 5 years and 10 years post-DVR. RESULTS: The median duration of hospital stay was 8 days. The number of patients with stroke was 11 (4.26%), 21 (8.7%) and 29 (12%) at the end of 1 year, 5 years, and 10 years, respectively. A total of 5 (2%) patients underwent reoperation by the end of 10 years. Seven patients died either in hospital or in the first 30 days following operation, making the early mortality 2.5%. At the end of 1 year, a total of 16 patients (5.8%) died. The mortality at the end of 5 years was 6.8% (19 patients), and at the end of 10 years, it was 7.2% (20 patients). The survival rate of the study population was 94.9%, 93.02% and 93.02% at the completion of 1 year, 5 years and 10 years, respectively. The freedom from MACCE was 93.8%, 88.6% and 85% at 1 year, 5 years and 10 years, respectively. The freedom from re-operation was 98% at 10 years. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed an overall survival time of 226.3 months in the entire study population. The mean survival time in males was 227.5 months and in females was 206.3 months, with no statistically significant difference between the two. Univariate logistic regression analysis revealed an association with mortality when DVR was combined with concomitant tricuspid valve repair procedures, with an odds ratio of 4.5 (p value 0.005). Multivariate logistic regression analysis also showed an association with mortality when tricuspid valve procedures were combined with DVR with an odds ratio of 5.25 (p value 0.003). CONCLUSION: The operative mortality and morbidity for DVR have been significantly reduced with advancements in operative techniques, myocardial preservation and postoperative care. Patients can have an improved functional status following surgery, with good rates of freedom from re-operation and MACCE.

Dysregulation of Endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase Does Not Depend on Hemodynamic Alterations in Bicuspid Aortic Valve Aortopathy.  ;Background Bicuspid aortic valves (BAVs) predispose to ascending aortic aneurysm. Turbulent blood flow and genetic factors have been proposed as underlying mechanisms. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) has been implicated in BAV aortopathy, and its expression is regulated by wall shear stress. We hypothesized that if turbulent flow induces aneurysm formation in patients with a BAV, regional differences in eNOS expression would be observed in BAVs. Methods and Results Ascending aortic specimens were harvested intraoperatively from 48 patients with tricuspid aortic valve (19 dilated, 29 nondilated) and 38 with BAV (28 dilated, 10 nondilated) undergoing cardiac surgery. eNOS mRNA and protein concentration were analyzed at the convex and concave aortic wall. In nondilated aortas, eNOS mRNA and protein concentration were decreased in BAV compared with tricuspid aortic valve (all P<0.05). eNOS expression was increased in association with dilation in BAV aortas (P=0.03), but not in tricuspid aortic valve aortas (P=0.63). There were no regional differences in eNOS mRNA or protein concentration in BAV aortas (all P>0.05). However, eNOS expression was increased at the concave wall (versus convexity) in tricuspid aortic valve dilated aortas (all P<0.05). Conclusions Dysregulated eNOS occurs independent of dilation in BAV aortas, suggesting a potential role for aberrantly regulated eNOS expression in the development of BAV-associated aneurysms. The absence of regional variations of eNOS expression suggests that eNOS dysregulation in BAV aortas is the result of underlying genetic factors associated with BAV disease, rather than changes stimulated by hemodynamic alterations. These findings provide insight into the underlying mechanisms of aortic dilation in patients with a BAV.

Symmetric dimethylarginine in dogs with myxomatous mitral valve disease at various stages of disease severity.  ;"Symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) is a serum biomarker of renal damage in dogs. Moreover, SDMA concentration is an independent predictor of development of severe heart failure (HF) in humans with cardiac disease. This study evaluates whether the serum concentration of SDMA in dogs with myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) is influenced by the severity of heart disease, pulmonary hypertension (PH) and treatment of HF. A total of 99 client-owned dogs were included in this retrospective case-control study; 78 dogs were affected by MMVD and classified according to the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine (ACVIM) guidelines, and 21 were healthy controls. For each dog, history, physical examination, complete blood count, biochemical profile, thoracic radiography, 6-lead standard electrocardiogram and trans-thoracic echocardiography were available. Comparisons were performed between groups of dogs belonging to different ACVIM stages and between dogs with and without PH. The median SDMA concentration was neither significantly different among groups of dogs in different disease stages (overall P = 0.010), nor among dogs with MMVD, nor between those with [14.5 μg/dl (10.5-18.8)] and without PH [13 μg/dl (9-17.2)] (P = 0.295). The concentration of SDMA did not differ between dogs when considering the combined effect of the ACVIM group and cardiac treatment (overall P = 0.486). Furthermore, no correlation was found between SDMA concentration and radiographic and echocardiographic parameters associated with increased MMVD severity. In conclusion, this study failed to demonstrate the presence of renal impairment in dogs with MMVD, and the increase in renal parameters in some dogs in the more advanced stage of MMVD could be attributed to pre-renal azotemia.

Aggrecan in Cardiovascular Development and Disease.  ;Aggrecan is a large proteoglycan that forms giant hydrated aggregates with hyaluronan in the extracellular matrix (ECM). The extraordinary resistance of these aggregates to compression explains their abundance in articular cartilage of joints where they ensure adequate load-bearing. In the brain, they provide mechanical buffering and contribute to formation of perineuronal nets, which regulate synaptic plasticity. Aggrecan is also present in cardiac jelly, developing heart valves, and blood vessels during cardiovascular development. Whereas aggrecan is essential for skeletal development, its function in the developing cardiovascular system remains to be fully elucidated. An excess of aggrecan was demonstrated in cardiovascular tissues in aortic aneurysms, atherosclerosis, vascular re-stenosis after injury, and varicose veins. It is a product of vascular smooth muscle and is likely to be an important component of pericellular matrix, where its levels are regulated by proteases. Aggrecan can contribute to specific biophysical and regulatory properties of cardiovascular ECM via the diverse interactions of its domains, and its accumulation is likely to have a significant role in developmental and disease pathways. Here, the established biological functions of aggrecan, its cardiovascular associations, and potential roles in cardiovascular development and disease are discussed.  
4D flow MRI applications in congenital heart disease.  ;Advances in the diagnosis and management of congenital heart disease (CHD) have resulted in a growing population of patients surviving well into adulthood and requiring lifelong follow-up. Flow quantification is a central component in the assessment of patients with CHD. 4D flow magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has emerged as a tool that enables comprehensive study of flow. It involves the acquisition of a three-dimensional time-resolved volume with velocity encoding in all three spatial directions along the cardiac cycle. This allows flow quantification and visualization of blood flow patterns as well as the study of advanced hemodynamic parameters as kinetic energy and wall shear stress. 4D flow MRI-based study of flow has given insight into the altered hemodynamics in CHD particularly in bicuspid aortic valve disease and Fontan circulation. The aim of this review is to discuss the expanding clinical and research applications of 4D flow MRI in CHD as well its limitations.Key Points• Three-dimensional velocity encoding allows not only flow quantification but also the visualization of multidirectional flow patterns and the study of advanced hemodynamic parameters.• 4D flow MRI has added insight into the abnormal hemodynamics involved in congenital heart disease in particular in bicuspid aortic valve and Fontan circulation.• The main limitation of 4D flow MRI in congenital heart disease is the relatively long scan duration required for the complete coverage of the heart and great vessels with adequate spatiotemporal resolution.

Systolic murmur in disguise: subclavian artery stenosis as an overlooked cause of missed case of hypertension.  ;In this report we present a case of missed hypertension due to subclavian artery stenosis. A 77 year-old female patient, initially thought as being normotensive, was referred to us due to newly discovered systolic heart murmur suspicious for aortic stenosis. We noted inter-arm blood pressure difference of 30 mmHg, with higher, hypertensive values on right arm. Further workup and medical imaging excluded aortic stenosis and revealed an asymptomatic, hemodynamically significant, stenosis of left subclavian artery. Due to absence of symptoms, the patient has been managed with conservative therapy for subclavian stenosis and hypertension, and she is currently in good conditions and followed up for any signs of disease progression. This case clearly shows importance of measuring blood pressure on both arms when initially diagnosing hypertension as this is often overlooked and is key to properly diagnose hypertension and possible subclavian stenosis.  
Conundrum of aortic stenosis in a case of multivalvular rheumatic heart disease: perspicuity is in the details.  ;A 36-year-old woman presented with dyspnoea on exertion for 5 years. She was evaluated elsewhere and diagnosed to have severe mitral stenosis. She was referred for mitral valve replacement to our centre. Echocardiography revealed a thickened aortic valve with mild aortic regurgitation, with transaortic gradient suggestive of mild aortic stenosis, in addition to severe rheumatic mitral stenosis. Detailed echocardiographic analysis and cardiac catheterisation revealed features suggestive of moderate to severe aortic stenosis. Detailed assessment of aortic valve needs to be done in patients with coexistent mitral stenosis. Each modality for assessment of aortic stenosis has its own limitations and a decision regarding treatment needs to be taken based on combined analysis of all the parameters. Dimensionless velocity index is a relatively less time-consuming, flow independent measure of aortic stenosis. Prompt recognition of this concealed aortic stenosis helps to avoid repeat valve surgery. Subsequently, patient was sent for dual valve replacement.  
Outpatient management of heart valve disease following the COVID-19 pandemic: implications for present and future care.  ;"The established processes for ensuring safe outpatient surveillance of patients with known heart valve disease (HVD), echocardiography for patients referred with new murmurs and timely delivery of surgical or transcatheter treatment for patients with severe disease have all been significantly impacted by the novel coronavirus pandemic. This has created a large backlog of work and upstaging of disease with consequent increases in risk and cost of treatment and potential for worse long-term outcomes. As countries emerge from lockdown but with COVID-19 endemic in society, precautions remain that restrict 'normal' practice. In this article, we propose a methodology for restructuring services for patients with HVD and provide recommendations pertaining to frequency of follow-up and use of echocardiography at present. It will be almost impossible to practice exactly as we did prior to the pandemic; thus, it is essential to prioritise patients with the greatest clinical need, such as those with symptomatic severe HVD. Local procedural waiting times will need to be considered, in addition to usual clinical characteristics in determining whether patients requiring intervention would be better suited having surgical or transcatheter treatment. We present guidance on the identification of stable patients with HVD that could have follow-up deferred safely and suggest certain patients that could be discharged from follow-up if waiting lists are triaged with appropriate clinical input. Finally, we propose that novel models of working enforced by the pandemic-such as increased use of virtual clinics-should be further developed and evaluated.  "
Valvular surgery in donor hearts before orthotopic heart transplantation.  ;"BACKGROUND: Donor heart shortage has extended the waiting time and increased the mortality of patients on the transplant waiting list. Widening old standard donor criteria has successfully increased the number of heart transplantations, but for many years, a valve disease in a donor heart has been considered a primary contraindication for organ donation. AIMS: To analyse the results of aortic and mitral valvular surgery in marginal donor hearts with valvulopathy before orthotopic heart transplantation. METHODS: Between January 2012 and November 2015, we performed 53 heart transplantations in our department. In four donors, echocardiography performed at the time of organ procurement showed a valvular disease: three had moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation; and one had moderately severe aortic valve stenosis. RESULTS: The mean bench mitral repair and aortic replacement time, aortic cross-clamp time and total ischaemic time were: 18 (range 7-25) minutes, 78.7 (range 57-98) minutes and 184 (range 89-255) minutes, respectively. Intraoperative transoesophageal echocardiography showed good mitral repair or aortic prosthetic valve function, and good right and left ventricular function. One patient died of infectious pneumonia after 1 month. The mean duration of follow-up for the patients discharged home was 75±13 months, and all have returned to an active unrestricted lifestyle. CONCLUSIONS: Our limited series demonstrates that conventional valvular procedures performed on otherwise healthy donor hearts with mitral and aortic valve pathology can efficaciously expand the donor pool for orthotopic cardiac transplantation and decrease the mortality rate on the waiting list.

Sana MK(1), Ahmed Z(2).  ;Pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect (PAVSD) is one of the cyanotic congenital heart diseases. It occurs due to under or maldevelopment of the right ventricular outflow tract along with atresia of the pulmonary valve and trunk. It also involves overriding of the aorta and a large ventricular septal defect. Previously it was termed as truncus arteriosus type IV. Whether it is a different entity or a severe form of Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) is still controversial, but there is no denying the occurrence of PAVSD. The spectrum of this defect varies in presentation and severity largely depending on the degree to which the pulmonary artery atresia is present. The major difference between the usual presentation of TOF and PAVSD is the presence of normal pulmonary trunk and arteries in TOF. A second prominent difference is the presence of major aortopulmonary collateral arteries (MAPCA) in PAVSD. Another notable difference is the presence of pulmonary valve atresia in PAVSD, unlike TOF where the pulmonary valve stenosis is prominent. Some physicians prefer to call this entity as TOF with pulmonary atresia and MAPCA.  Although when severe enough, TOF overlaps significantly with PAVSD and may even be managed as such, the management hardly changes so there is no ambiguity about consensus at least treatment-wise. For the purpose of this article, we are going to consider PAVSD as a separate entity from classical TOF.  
Predictors of Long-term Cardiovascular Versus Non-cardiovascular Mortality and Repeat Intervention in Patients Having Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.  ;"There is a paucity of literature characterizing the risk of long-term mortality and reintervention after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). Addressing this gap has become increasingly relevant with the inclusion of intermediate and low surgical risk patients and the need for data to inform their long-term management. We sought to investigate the long-term trends and predictors of cardiovascular versus noncardiovascular mortality as well as reintervention in post-TAVI patients. Our cohort consisted of 5,406 patients who underwent TAVI in Ontario, Canada from 2011 to 2018. We used Kaplan-Meier analysis to estimate 7-year all-cause mortality and a Cox proportional hazard model to identify demographic, co-morbid, and procedural predictors. Similarly, cumulative incidence functions were used to estimate cardiovascular versus noncardiovascular mortality at 5 years, with predictors identified through Fine-Gray models. The Kaplan-Meier estimate for 7-year all-cause mortality in our cohort was 67%; this was driven by a number of co-morbidities including congestive heart failure and liver disease. We found that cardiovascular death was more likely for approximately the first 2 years post-TAVI whereas noncardiovascular death was more likely from this point to the end of the study. We identified a number of factors that uniquely modified the risk of either cardiovascular or noncardiovascular mortality. Only 1.6% of patients who underwent repeat intervention. The distinct factors associated with cardiovascular versus noncardiovascular death suggest different approaches to short-term and long-term surveillance of patients post-TAVI by both the heart team and primary care providers.

Prognostic Implications of Significant Isolated Tricuspid Regurgitation in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation Without Left-Sided Heart Disease or Pulmonary Hypertension.  ;"The prognostic impact of isolated tricuspid regurgitation (TR) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) has not been investigated. The purpose of this study was to investigate the prognostic implications of significant isolated TR in AF patients without left-sided heart disease, pulmonary hypertension, or primary structural abnormalities of the tricuspid valve. A total of 63 AF patients with moderate and severe TR were matched for age and gender to 116 AF patients without significant TR. Patients were followed for the occurrence of all-cause mortality, hospitalization for heart failure and stroke. Patients with significant isolated TR (mean age 71 ± 8 years, 57% men) more often had paroxysmal AF as compared with patients without TR (mean age 71 ± 7 years, 60% men) (60% vs 43%, p = 0.028). In addition, right atrial size and tricuspid annular diameter were significantly larger in patients with significant isolated TR compared with their counterparts. During follow-up (median 62 [34 to 95] months), 53 events for the combined endpoint occurred. One- and 5-year event-free survival rates for patients with significant isolated TR were 76% and 56%, compared with 92% and 85% for patients without significant TR, respectively (Log rank Chi-Square p <0.001). The presence of significant isolated TR was independently associated with the combined endpoint (hazard ratio, 2.853; 95% confidence interval, 1.458 to 5.584; p = 0.002). In conclusion, in the absence of left-sided heart disease and pulmonary hypertension, significant isolated TR is independently associated with worse event-free survival in patients with AF.  "
Transcatheter mitral valve in ring, hazards of long anterior mitral leaflet and 3-dimensional rings.  ;OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to define anterior mitral leaflet (AML) length and mitral ring characteristics associated with LVOT obstruction and PVL following MViR. BACKGROUND: Transcatheter Mitral Valve in Ring (MViR) procedural complications including parvalvular leak (PVL) and left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction are frequent. METHODS: Clinical records, computer tomographic scans (CTs) and echocardiograms of consecutive MViR patients were retrospectively reviewed for anterior mitral leaflet length, CT-simulated neoLVOT, and aortomitral angle among patients with and without MViR-induced LVOT obstruction. Acute and 1-year outcomes are described. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients underwent MViR. Technical success was achieved in 13/22 (57.1%) patients, limited by paravalvular regurgitation requiring second transcatheter heart valves (THVs) in seven patients. Second valves were needed in 6/11 (54.5%) patients with 3-dimensional rings but 1/11 (9.1%, p = .06) of patients with planar rings. Procedure success at 30 days was achieved in 20/22 (90.9%) patients. There were no procedural, in-hospital, or 30-day deaths. Two patients developed significant LVOT obstruction, one managed with urgent surgery and one with elective alcohol septal ablation. Anterior mitral leaflets were longer among the two patients with LVOT obstruction than the 20 patients who did not develop LVOT obstruction when measured by TEE (30 mm vs. 21 mm, p = .009) or by CT (29 mm vs. 22 mm, p = .026). CONCLUSIONS: AML >25 mm increases the risk of MViR induced LVOT obstruction. PVL is common, particularly in 3-dimensional rings which can be managed with a second THV.  
Use of MitraClip to Target Obstructive SAM in Severe Diffuse-Type Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy: Case Report and Review of Literature.  ;"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is frequently associated with abnormalities of the mitral valve; these commonly include systolic anterior motion (SAM) of anterior mitral leaflets that contribute to dynamic left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction and secondary mitral regurgitation (MR). In patients with severe HCM, LVOT obstruction due to SAM, and debilitating symptoms refractory to medical therapy, the current standard of care involves a surgical approach. This involves targeting the ventricular septum through resection or ablation, combined at times with mitral valve replacement or plication of the valve leaflet to relieve LVOT obstruction. In patients with symptoms refractory to medical management who are at prohibitive surgical risk, additional options for less-invasive approaches for the management of HCM are needed. We describe here the successful non-surgical catheter-based management of a 72-year-old woman at high surgical risk, debilitating symptoms refractory to maximal medical management, and severe, diffuse-type HCM. Edge-to-edge repair with MitraClip (Abbott Vascular) was used to target SAM causing dynamic LVOT obstruction, with resulting significant reduction in LVOT gradient and dramatic clinical improvement. Her postprocedure outcomes to 2 years are reported herein. Additionally, we review the current management strategies for HCM management, and include a discussion of minimally invasive options.  "

Stentless Root Replacement versus Tissue Valves in Infective Endocarditis - A Propensity-Score Matched Study.  ;INTRODUCTION: People with aortic/prosthetic valve endocarditis are a high-risk cohort of patients who present a challenge for all medically involved disciplines and who can be treated by various surgical techniques. METHODS: We analyzed the results of treatment of root endocarditis with Medtronic Freestyle® in full-root technique over 19 years (1999-2018) and compared them against treatment with other tissue valves. Comparison was made with propensity score matching, using the nearest neighbor method. Various tests were performed as suited for adequate analyses. RESULTS: Fifty-four patients in the Medtronic Freestyle group (FS group) were matched against 54 complex root endocarditis patients treated with other tissue valves (Tissue group). Hospital mortality was 9/54 (16.7%) in the FS group vs. 14/54 (25.6%) in the Tissue group (P=0.24). Cox regression performed for early results demonstrated coronary heart disease (P=0.004, odds ratio 2.3), among others, influencing early mortality. Recurrent infection was low (1.8% for FS and Tissue patients) and freedom from reoperation was 97.2% at a total of 367 patient-years of follow-up (median of 2.7 years). CONCLUSION: The stentless xenograft is a viable alternative for treatment of valve/root/prosthetic endocarditis, demonstrating a low rate of reinfection. The design of the bioroot allows for complex reconstructive procedures at the outflow tract and the annular level with at an acceptable operative risk. Endocarditis patients can be treated excluding infective tissue from the bloodstream, possibly with benefits, concerning bacteremia and recurrent infection. Furthermore, the use of the stentless bioroot offers varying treatment options in case of future valve degeneration.  
Allografts and xenografts for right ventricular outflow tract reconstruction in Ross patients.  ;OBJECTIVES: Pulmonary allografts (AG) are the gold standard for right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) reconstruction during the Ross procedure. However, there is limited availability of AG in some countries, and the use of alternative grafts for RVOT reconstruction remains controversial. This study aimed to compare the rates of freedom from RVOT graft dysfunction for AG and diepoxide-treated pericardial xenografts (DPXG). METHODS: Between 1998 and 2015, 793 adult patients underwent the Ross procedure in our centre. Using propensity score matching, the clinical outcomes and echocardiographic results of AG and DPXG were compared. RESULTS: Propensity score matching resulted in 2 groups (AG and DPXG) of 122 patients each. No difference was found in early mortality (2.5%) in both groups. The freedom from RVOT graft dysfunction curves were comparable between the AG and DPXG groups (P = 0.186) and the 8-year rates of freedom from graft dysfunction were 91.8% and 82.2%, respectively. The survival rates at 8 years were 90.5% and 90.1%, and the rates of freedom from RVOT reintervention at 8 years were 100% and 96.8% for the AG and DPXG groups, respectively. At discharge and follow-up, transprosthetic gradients were significantly higher in the DPXG group. The rate of the RVOT gradient progression was also higher in the DPXG group than in the AG group (1.80 ± 0.06 vs 1.39 ± 0.04 mmHg/year, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: There was no difference in freedom from RVOT graft dysfunction by 8 years when using AG and DPXG in adult Ross patients, nor in survival and freedom from RVOT conduit reintervention. Long-term results need further evaluation.  
Temporal Trends in the Incidence and Outcomes of Pacemaker Implantation After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in the United States (2012-2017).  ;Background Nationwide studies documenting temporal trends in permanent pacemaker implantation (PPMI) following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) are limited. Methods and Results We selected patients who underwent TAVR between 2012 and 2017 in the National Readmission Database. The primary end point was the 6-year trend in post-TAVR PPMI at index hospitalization and at 30, 90, and 180 days after discharge. The secondary end point was the association between PPMI and in-hospital mortality, stroke, cost, length of stay, and disposition. Among the 89 202 patients who underwent TAVR, 77 405 (86.8%) with no prior pacemaker or defibrillator were included. Patients who required PPMI had a higher prevalence of atrial fibrillation (43.6% versus 38.7%, P<0.001) and conduction abnormalities (28.4% versus 15.3%, P<0.001). The incidence of PPMI during index admission increased from 8.7% in 2012 to 13.2% in 2015, and then decreased to 9.6% in 2017. The incidence of inpatient PPMI within 30 days after discharge increased from 0.5% in 2012 to 1.25% in 2017 (Ptrend<0.001). Inpatient PPMI beyond 30 days remained rare (<0.5%) during the study period. After risk adjustment, PPMI was not associated with in-hospital mortality or stroke but was associated with increased nonhome discharge, longer hospitalization, and higher cost. The incremental expenditure associated with post-TAVR PPMI during index admission increased from $9.6 million to $72.2 million between 2012 and 2017. Conclusions After an upward trend, rates of PPMI after TAVR in the United States stabilized at ~10% in 2016 to 2017, but there was a notable increase in PPMI within 30 days after the index admission. PPMI was not associated with increased in-hospital morbidity or mortality but led to longer hospitalization, higher cost, and more nonhome discharges.  
Early extubation in current valve surgery requiring long cardiopulmonary bypass: Benefits and predictive value of preoperative spirometry.  ;BACKGROUND: Early extubation (EEx) after cardiac surgery has been essentially studied in patients with short cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Whether preoperative spirometry can predict EEx remains controversial. OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether EEx can be a goal and predicted by preoperative spirometry in valve surgery requiring long CPB. METHODS: Nonemergent consecutive 210 patients who underwent valve surgery from January 2014 to August 2019 were investigated retrospectively. RESULTS: EEx (<8 h) was achieved in 93 (44.3%) patients without increasing adverse events. Patients with EEx had shorter ICU and hospital stays than those without EEx. Multivariate analysis showed that higher estimated glomerular filtration rate and mitral valve repair were significant protective factors for EEx. Conversely, moderate and severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease defined by spirometry, longer operation, CPB, and aortic cross-clamp time were significant risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: EEx should be the goal in current valve surgery. Preoperative spirometry is a significant predictor.  
Sex-differences in echocardiographic assessment of aortic valve in young adult LDLr(-/-)/ApoB(100/100)/IGF-II(+/-) mice.  ;BACKGROUND: LDLr-/-/ApoB100/100/IGF-II+/- mice are used as a calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) model. However, normal aortic valve hemodynamics i.e. remotely from CAVD onset and the sex-related differences are poorly known. METHODS AND RESULTS: Four groups of mice, intact males (IM, n = 49) and females (IF, n = 50), castrated males (CxM, n = 79) and ovariectomized females (OxF: 73), underwent a Doppler-echocardiography at 12 weeks of age. Gonadectomy was performed at 8 weeks. Aortic valve assessment using effective orifice area (EOA, using the continuity equation) and peak aortic transvalvular velocity (VPeak) was feasible in 89% of the mice with good to excellent reliability (intraclass correlation coefficients ranging from 0.90 to 0.98, p < 0.001). Mean VPeak was 104 ± 17 cm/s and mean EOA was 1.18*10-2 ± 0.22*10-2 cm2. EOA indexed to body surface area was 1.5 ± 0.3 cm2/m2. The 95th percentile of Vpeak was 132 cm/s and the 5th percentile of indexed EOA was 1.0 cm2/m2. Interestingly, IM had the highest VPeak (114 ± 14 cm/s) vs each of the other groups (CxM: 106 ± 19 cm/s, OxF: 97 ± 13 cm/s and IF: 96 ± 12 cm/s, ANOVA and corrected p < 0.001). This was mostly explained by a higher stroke volume (ANOVA and corrected p < 0.001) in IM compared to other groups. There were no major sex-differences in ventricular systolic function parameters. CONCLUSION: In LDLr-/-/ApoB100/100/IGF-II CAVD mice model, an aortic EOA <0.8*10-2 cm2 (or indexed EOA <1.0cm2/m2), and a peak aortic valve velocity > 132 cm/s may be proposed as thresholds to define CAVD. Intact male mice appear to have higher velocities.

3D Myocardial Mechanical Wave Measurements: Toward In Vivo 3D Myocardial Elasticity Mapping.  ;"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the potential of a novel 3-dimensional (3D) mechanical wave velocity mapping technique, based on the natural mechanical waves produced by the heart itself, to approach a noninvasive 3D stiffness mapping of the left ventricle. BACKGROUND: Myocardial fibrosis is recognized as a pathophysiological substrate of major cardiovascular disorders such as cardiomyopathies and valvular heart disease. As fibrosis leads to increased myocardial stiffness, ultrasound elastography measurements could provide important clinical information. METHODS: A 3D high frame rate imaging sequence was implemented on a high-end clinical ultrasound scanner to achieve 820 volumes/s when gating over 4 consecutive cardiac cycles. Five healthy volunteers and 10 patients with various degrees of aortic stenosis were included to evaluate feasibility and reproducibility. Mechanical waves were detected using the novel Clutter Filter Wave Imaging approach, shown to be highly sensitive to the weak tissue displacements caused by natural mechanical waves. RESULTS: 3D spatiotemporal maps of mechanical wave velocities were produced for all subjects. Only the specific mechanical wave at atrial contraction provided a full 3D coverage of the left ventricle (LV). The average atrial kick propagation velocity was 1.6 ± 0.2 m/s in healthy volunteers and 2.8 ± 0.8 m/s in patients (p = 0.0016). A high correlation was found between mechanical wave velocity and age (R2 = 0.88, healthy group), septal wall thickness (R2 = 0.73, entire group), and peak jet velocity across the aortic valve (R2 = 0.70). For 3 of the patients, the higher mechanical wave velocity coexisted with the presence of late gadolinium enhancement on cardiac magnetic resonance. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, 3D LV mechanical wave velocities were visualized and measured in healthy volunteers and patients with aortic stenosis. The proposed imaging sequence and measurement technique allowed, for the first time, the measurement of full spatiotemporal 3D elasticity maps of the LV using ultrasound.

3D Printing, Computational Modeling, and Artificial Intelligence for Structural Heart Disease.  ;Structural heart disease (SHD) is a new field within cardiovascular medicine. Traditional imaging modalities fall short in supporting the needs of SHD interventions, as they have been constructed around the concept of disease diagnosis. SHD interventions disrupt traditional concepts of imaging in requiring imaging to plan, simulate, and predict intraprocedural outcomes. In transcatheter SHD interventions, the absence of a gold-standard open cavity surgical field deprives physicians of the opportunity for tactile feedback and visual confirmation of cardiac anatomy. Hence, dependency on imaging in periprocedural guidance has led to evolution of a new generation of procedural skillsets, concept of a visual field, and technologies in the periprocedural planning period to accelerate preclinical device development, physician, and patient education. Adaptation of 3-dimensional (3D) printing in clinical care and procedural planning has demonstrated a reduction in early-operator learning curve for transcatheter interventions. Integration of computation modeling to 3D printing has accelerated research and development understanding of fluid mechanics within device testing. Application of 3D printing, computational modeling, and ultimately incorporation of artificial intelligence is changing the landscape of physician training and delivery of patient-centric care. Transcatheter structural heart interventions are requiring in-depth periprocedural understanding of cardiac pathophysiology and device interactions not afforded by traditional imaging metrics.  
Surgical versus transcatheter aortic valve replacement in patients with malignancy.  ;"BACKGROUND: Patients with aortic stenosis (AS) and malignancy experience poor clinical outcomes with challenging decisions regarding aortic valve replacement (AVR). We sought to compare the outcomes of transcatheter (TAVR) versus surgical (SAVR) AVR in patients with AS and malignancy. METHODS: Based on the Nationwide Readmission Database, we compared all patients with malignancy who underwent isolated SAVR vs. TAVR in 2016 for severe AS. We performed univariate and multivariate analyses for baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes. A total of 2566 patients were included, 1952 (76%) had TAVR and the remaining 614 (24%) had isolated SAVR. Patients who underwent TAVR were older (82 vs 72 years, p < .001), had more metastasis (19 vs 14%, p = .004), heart failure (72% vs 34%, p < .001), coronary artery disease (72% vs 52%, p < .001), anemia (28% vs 22%, p = .006), chronic lung (30% vs 22%, p < .001) and renal disease (35% vs 14%, p < .001), and shorter length of stay (3 vs 7 days, p < .001). RESULTS: In multivariate regression, TAVR and SAVR had similar in-patient mortality (HR = 1.08; 95%CI 0.61 ̶ 1.94) and 30-day readmission (HR = 1.26; 95%CI 0.95 ̶ 1.67). TAVR was associated with lower vascular complications (HR = 0.59; 95%CI 0.41 ̶ 0.86), acute deep venous thrombosis (HR = 0.25, 95%CI 0.1 ̶ 0.59), acute kidney injury (HR = 0.24, 95%CI 0.17 ̶ 0.33), blood transfusion (HR = 0.22, 95%CI 0.16 ̶ 0.3), cardiogenic shock (HR = 0.48, 95%CI 0.26 ̶ 0.89), and respiratory complications (HR = 0.26, 95%CI 0.2 ̶ 0.35). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with malignancy, TAVR is a viable and safe option compared to SAVR with better clinical outcomes, especially thromboembolic events.  "

Etiology and distribution of isolated aortic stenosis in Indian patients - A study from a large tertiary care hospital in north India.  ;"BACKGROUND: Isolated aortic valve disease (IAVD) has traditionally been a disease of elderly, etiology being either senile degeneration of a tricuspid aortic valve or calcification of a bicuspid aortic valve. However, there is scarcity of Indian data regarding demographic distribution and etiological patterns of IAVD in context of emerging therapies like transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVR). METHODS & RESULTS: A retrospective observational analysis of 60,560 echocardiograms over three years revealed 3728 newly diagnosed cases of valvular heart disease (VHD). Isolated mitral valve disease (IMVD) constituted 48.7% (n = 1815) of all VHD, including 1104 (29.6%) cases of pure mitral stenosis (MS) which was the commonest single lesion followed by combined mitral and aortic valve disease (CMAVD) (n = 1320, 34.5%), mixed aortic valve disease (MAVD) (n = 349, 9.4%), isolated aortic stenosis (IAS) (n = 179, 4.8%) and isolated aortic regurgitation (IAR) (n = 75, 2.0%). IAS patients had bimodal age distribution with peaks in first and sixth decade, contributed by congenital and acquired IAS respectively. Acquired IAS comprised of degenerative tricuspid aortic valve (n = 79, 58.1%; mean age: 63.2 ± 8.8 years), bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) (n = 34, 25.0%; mean age: 36.0 ± 8.3 years), rheumatic (n = 4, 2.9%; mean age: 55.3 ± 3.4 years) and non-rheumatic IAS with unclear morphology (n = 19, 14%; mean age: 48.5 ± 9.3 years). 65.6% patients with acquired non-rheumatic isolated aortic stenosis were less than 60 years of age. CONCLUSION: In Indian population, senile valvular degeneration is the commonest cause of acquired IAS with majority of them presenting before 60 years of age, thereby bereaving them with the option of TAVR as a treatment modality.

Infective endocarditis in patients after percutaneous pulmonary valve implantation with the stent-mounted bovine jugular vein valve: Clinical experience and evaluation of the modified Duke criteria.  ;AIMS: Percutaneous pulmonary valve implantation (PPVI) has proven good hemodynamic results. As infective endocarditis (IE) remains a potential complication with limited available clinical data, we reviewed our patient records to improve future strategies of IE prevention, diagnosis and treatment. METHODS: Medical records of all patients diagnosed with Melody® valve IE according to the modified Duke criteria were retrospectively analyzed in three Belgian tertiary centers. RESULTS: 23 IE episodes in 22 out of 240 patients were identified (incidence 2.4% / patient year) with a clear male predominance (86%). Median age at IE was 17.9 years (range 8.2-45.9 years) and median time from PPVI to IE was 2.4 years (range 0.7-8 years). Streptococcal species caused 10 infections (43%), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (n = 5, 22%). In 13/23 IE episodes a possible entry-point was identified (57%). IE was classified as definite in 15 (65%) and as possible in 8 (35%) cases due to limitations of imaging. Echocardiography visualized vegetations in only 10 patients. PET-CT showed positive FDG signals in 5/7 patients (71%) and intracardiac echocardiography a vegetation in 1/1 patient (100%). Eleven cases (48%) had a hemodynamically relevant pulmonary stenosis at IE presentation. Nine early and 6 late percutaneous or surgical re-interventions were performed. No IE related deaths occurred. CONCLUSIONS: IE after Melody® valve PPVI is associated with a relevant need of re-interventions. Communication to patients and physicians about risk factors is essential in prevention. The modified Duke criteria underperformed in diagnosing definite IE, but inclusion of new imaging modalities might improve diagnostic performance.  
Pseudoaneurysm of the mitral-aortic intervalvular fibrosa following endocarditis and aortic valve surgery in an infant-Case report and exhaustive systematic review of pediatric cases.  ;Pseudoaneurysm of the mitral-aortic intervalvular fibrosa (P-MAIVF) continues to be a rare diagnosis in children. Etiology, presentation, and management strategies are considerably different from adults. We report a fatal case of P-MAIVF with classical transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiographic findings complemented by CT imaging. The natural course of uncomplicated/asymptomatic P-MAIVF is largely unknown since most patients are offered surgery. We present an extensive literature review of pediatric P-MAIVF and highlight important differences from the adult form of this disease.  
Challenges in Perioperative Animal Care for Orthotopic Implantation of Tissue-Engineered Pulmonary Valves in the Ovine Model.  ;BACKGROUND: Development of valvular substitutes meeting the performance criteria for surgical correction of congenital heart malformations is a major research challenge. The sheep is probably the most widely used animal model in heart valves regenerative medicine. Although the standard cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) technique and various anesthetic and surgical protocols are reported to be feasible and safe, they are associated with significant morbidity and mortality rates. The premise of this paper is that the surgical technique itself, especially the perioperative animal care and management protocol, is essential for successful outcomes and survival. METHODS: Ten juvenile and adult female sheep aged 7.8-37.5 months and weighing 32.0-58.0 kg underwent orthotopic implantation of tissue-engineered pulmonary valve conduits on beating heart under normothermic CPB. The animals were followed-up for 6 months before scheduled euthanasia. RESULTS: Based on our observations, we established a guide for perioperative care, follow-up, and treatment containing information regarding the appropriate clinical, biological, and ultrasound examinations and recommendations for feasible and safe anesthetic, surgical, and euthanasia protocols. Specific recommendations were also included for perioperative care of juvenile versus adult sheep. CONCLUSION: The described surgical technique was feasible, with a low mortality rate and minimal surgical complications. The proposed anesthetic protocol was safe and effective, ensuring both adequate sedation and analgesia as well as rapid recovery from anesthesia without significant complications. The established guide for postoperative care, follow-up and treatment in sheep after open-heart surgery may help other research teams working in the field of heart valves tissue regeneration.  
Phenome-wide analyses establish a specific association between aortic valve PALMD expression and calcific aortic valve stenosis.  ;Calcific aortic valve stenosis (CAVS) is a frequent heart disease with significant morbidity and mortality. Recent genomic studies have identified a locus near the gene PALMD (palmdelphin) strongly associated with CAVS. Here, we show that genetically-determined expression of PALMD in the aortic valve is inversely associated with CAVS, with a stronger effect in women, in a meta-analysis of two large cohorts totaling 2359 cases and 350,060 controls. We further demonstrate the specificity of this relationship by showing the absence of other significant association between the genetically-determined expression of PALMD in 9 tissues and 852 phenotypes. Using genome-wide association studies meta-analyses of cardiovascular traits, we identify a significant colocalized positive association between genetically-determined expression of PALMD in four non-cardiac tissues (brain anterior cingulate cortex, esophagus muscularis, tibial nerve and subcutaneous adipose tissue) and atrial fibrillation. The present work further establishes PALMD as a promising molecular target for CAVS.  
Characterization and validation of a preventative therapy for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in a murine model of the disease.  ;"Currently there is an unmet need for treatments that can prevent hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Using a murine model we previously identified that HCM causing cardiac troponin I mutation Gly203Ser (cTnI-G203S) is associated with increased mitochondrial metabolic activity, consistent with the human condition. These alterations precede development of the cardiomyopathy. Here we examine the efficacy of in vivo treatment of cTnI-G203S mice with a peptide derived against the α-interaction domain of the cardiac L-type calcium channel (AID-TAT) on restoring mitochondrial metabolic activity, and preventing HCM. cTnI-G203S or age-matched wt mice were treated with active or inactive AID-TAT. Following treatment, targeted metabolomics was utilized to evaluate myocardial substrate metabolism. Cardiac myocyte mitochondrial metabolic activity was assessed as alterations in mitochondrial membrane potential and flavoprotein oxidation. Cardiac morphology and function were examined using echocardiography. Cardiac uptake was assessed using an in vivo multispectral imaging system. We identified alterations in six biochemical intermediates in cTnI-G203S hearts consistent with increased anaplerosis. We also reveal that AID-TAT treatment of precardiomyopathic cTnI-G203S mice, but not mice with established cardiomyopathy, restored cardiac myocyte mitochondrial membrane potential and flavoprotein oxidation, and prevented myocardial hypertrophy. Importantly, AID-TAT was rapidly targeted to the heart, and not retained by the liver or kidneys. Overall, we identify biomarkers of HCM resulting from the cTnI mutation Gly203Ser, and present a safe, preventative therapy for associated cardiomyopathy. Utilizing AID-TAT to modulate cardiac metabolic activity may be beneficial in preventing HCM in ""at risk"" patients with identified Gly203Ser gene mutations.  "
Combined Coronary CT Angiography and Evaluation of Access Vessels for TAVR Patients in Free-Breathing with Single Contrast Medium Injection Using a 16-cm-Wide Detector CT.  ;RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To investigate the feasibility of combining coronary computed tomography (CT) angiography (CCTA) and CTA to evaluate access vessels for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) patients in free-breathing and with single contrast medium injection using a 16-cm-wide detector CT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and twenty-one consecutive patients (73.33 ± 6.43 years) referred for TAVR underwent a serious CT scans in free-breathing after one contrast injection: ECG-triggered one-heartbeat axial CCTA, followed by non-ECG-gated neck, thoracic, and abdominal CTA. Patient weight-dependent contrast dose volume at 1.0 mL/kg was used. CT attenuation values of the coronary, neck, aortic, iliac, and femoral arteries were measured and their image quality was evaluated with a 4-point score method. Stenosis (≥50%) in CCTA was evaluated using invasive coronary angiography result as a reference standard. Radiation and contrast doses were assessed. RESULTS: The total dose-length-product for the entire examination was 411.4 ± 91.2 mGy.cm, and the total contrast dose was 57.3 ± 9.9 mL. There were adequate attenuations (>400 HU) in all arteries, and the peripheral access vessels and aortic annulus were evaluable in all patients. In neck CTA, 5 patients had vascular tortuosity, 6 patients had aberrant arteries and there were 212 plaques and 13 severe stenoses among the patients. In CCTA, on the per-segment, per-vessel, and per-patient analysis, CCTA showed a sensitivity and negative predictive value of (95% and 99%), (95% and 99%), and (96% and 98%), respectively, for the entire patient cohort, and (92% and 98%), (92% and 98%), and (88% and 93%), respectively, for patients with atrial fibrillation or heart rate higher than 75 beats. CONCLUSION: It is feasible to perform a combined CCTA and CTA for evaluating access vessels for TAVR patients in free-breathing with single contrast injection. This approach generates acceptable image quality for all vessels and a high negative predictive value in excluding coronary artery disease with relatively low radiation and contrast doses.  
Early Outcomes of Percutaneous Pulmonary Valve Implantation with Pulsta and Melody Valves: The First Report from Korea.  ;Percutaneous pulmonary valve implantation (PPVI) is used to treat pulmonary stenosis (PS) or pulmonary regurgitation (PR). We described our experience with PPVI, specifically valve-in-valve transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement using the Melody valve and novel self-expandable systems using the Pulsta valve. We reviewed data from 42 patients undergoing PPVI. Twenty-nine patients had Melody valves in mostly bioprosthetic valves, valved conduits, and homografts in the pulmonary position. Following Melody valve implantation, the peak right ventricle-to-pulmonary artery gradient decreased from 51.3 ± 11.5 to 16.7 ± 3.3 mmHg and right ventricular systolic pressure fell from 70.0 ± 16.8 to 41.3 ± 17.8 mmHg. Thirteen patients with native right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) lesions and homograft underwent PPVI with the new self-expandable Pulsta valve-a nitinol wire stent mounted with a trileaflet porcine pericardial valve. Following Pulsta valve implantation, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showed a decreased PR fraction and that the right ventricular end-diastolic volume index decreased from 166.1 ± 11.9 to 123.6 ± 12.4 mL/m2. There were no mortality, severe procedural morbidity, or valve-related complications. At the mean 14.2 month (4-57 months) follow-up, no patients had more than mild PR. PPVI using Melody and Pulsta valves was first shown to provide excellent early outcomes without serious adverse event in most patients with RVOT dysfunction in Korea.  
Transcatheter therapies for tricuspid valve regurgitation.  ;: Tricuspid regurgitation, either isolated or associated with left-valve disease, has a strong impact on outcome. Surgical treatment of tricuspid regurgitation has increased in recent years, but in-hospital mortality remains high probably due to the risk profile of the recipients. As a consequence, most of the patients with severe tricuspid regurgitation, especially if isolated, remain untreated. Transcatheter tricuspid valve interventions are rapidly spreading as alternative options to open-heart procedures fulfilling this important unmet need. Although patient selection and timing of intervention are unclear, many devices have been developed in recent years for both repair and replacement of tricuspid valve. Repair tools can be targeted to leaflets or annulus. Replacement devices include heterotopic and orthotropic systems. The aim of this review is to report possible indications and summarize current data about the different devices available for transcatheter tricuspid valve interventions.  
Partial atrioventricular septal defect in an adult sport horse.  ;A partial atrioventricular septal defect, represented as a large ostium primum atrial septal defect and common (bridging) atrioventricular valve leaflets with cleft septal leaflet of the mitral valve, was diagnosed incidentally in a nine-year-old warmblood gelding used for show jumping. Initial examination findings and a three-year follow-up are documented in this report. The horse was first presented for the evaluation of chronic coughing. A left-sided, grade 4/6 holosystolic (band-shaped) murmur was identified along with a similar right-sided, grade 3/6 heart murmur. Echocardiography revealed a 6.4 cm diameter communication in the ventral atrial septum, considered an ostium primum atrial septal defect, with bidirectional shunting. A hypertrophic septomarginal trabecula, a thickened tricuspid valve, a cleft septal leaflet of the mitral valve, moderate mitral and tricuspid regurgitation likely related to leaflet prolapse, mild aortic regurgitation, and signs of moderate right ventricular volume overload were found as well. Electrocardiography showed no arrhythmias neither at rest nor during treadmill exercise. The owner continued to use the horse for show jumping. No exercise intolerance or other signs of disease were noted. Follow-up examination was performed three years after initial presentation. Contrast echocardiography confirmed the presence of right-to-left shunting through the atrial septal defect. Compared with the initial examination, the left ventricular internal diameter on M-mode echocardiography had increased. Occasional ventricular premature depolarizations were noted on the resting and exercise electrocardiogram. This is the first description of a clinically asymptomatic partial atrioventricular septal defect in an adult sport horse.  
Short-term outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve replacement for pure native aortic regurgitation in the United States.  ;"OBJECTIVE: We aimed to compare short-term outcomes between transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) for pure aortic regurgitation (AR) and TAVR for aortic stenosis (AS). BACKGROUND: In patients with severe pure AR for whom surgical valve replacement is infeasible, TAVR is sometimes used off-label. METHODS: Using the Nationwide Readmissions Database 2016-2017, we retrospectively identified patients without prior valve surgery who underwent endovascular TAVR. We compared in-hospital and 30-day outcomes according to the type of aortic valve disease. RESULTS: A total of 81,542 eligible patients were divided into the pure AR (n = 1,222, 1.50%), pure AS (n = 72,690, 89.1%), and AS + AR (n = 7,630, 9.36%) groups. In unadjusted analyses, the pure AR group, compared with the pure AS and AS + AR groups, showed a higher incidence of acute kidney injury (16.8% vs. 9.8% vs. 12.1%, respectively; p < .001) and need of surgical bailout (1.4% vs. 0.4% vs. 0.6%; p < .01). The pure AR group also showed higher in-hospital mortality than the pure AS group (2.4% vs. 1.4%; p = .005). After multivariable adjustment, TAVR for pure AR was significantly associated with a higher risk of acute kidney injury (odds ratio [OR] = 1.64, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.33-2.02; p < .001), cardiac tamponade (OR = 1.98, 95% CI = 1.00-3.92; p = .0498), and prolonged hospital stay (OR = 1.59, 95% CI = 1.29-1.95; p < .001) compared with TAVR for pure AS, whereas it was not significantly associated with in-hospital mortality (OR = 1.55, 95% CI = 0.99-2.45; p = .058) and other outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: TAVR may be a reasonable treatment option for selected patients with pure AR with regard to short-term outcomes. However, additional techniques or devices may be necessary to reduce periprocedural risk.  "

Artificial intelligence trumps TAVI(2)-SCORE and CoreValve Score in predicting 1-year mortality post Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.  ;BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Machine learning has been used to predict procedural risk in patients undergoing various medical interventions and procedures. One-year mortality in patients after Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR) has a wide range (from 8.5 to 24% in various studies). We sought to apply machine learning to determine predictors of one year mortality in patients undergoing TAVR. METHODS/MATERIALS: A retrospective study of 1055 patients who underwent TAVR (Jan 2014-June 2017) with one-year follow up was completed. Baseline demographics, clinical, electrocardiography (ECG), Computed Tomography (CT) and echocardiography data were abstracted. Variables with near zero variance or ≥50% missing data were excluded. The Gradient Boosting Machine learning (GBM) prediction model included 163 variables and was optimized using 5-fold cross-validation repeated 10-times. The receiver operator characteristic (ROC) for the GBM model was calculated to predict one-year mortality post TAVR, and then compared to the TAVI2-SCORE and CoreValve score. RESULTS: Among 1055 TAVR patients (mean age 80.9 ± 7.9 years, 42% female), 14.02% died at one year. 78% had balloon expandable valves placed. Based on GBM, the ten most predictive variables for one-year survival were cardiac power index, hemoglobin, systolic blood pressure, INR, diastolic blood pressure, body mass index, valve calcium score, serum creatinine, aortic annulus area, and albumin. The area under ROC to predict survival for the GBM model vs TAVI2-SCORE and CoreValve Score was 0.72 (95% CI 0.68-0.78) vs 0.56 (95%CI 0.51-0.62) and 0.53 (95% CI 0.47-0.59) respectively with p < 0.0001. CONCLUSION: The GBM model outperforms TAVI2-SCORE and CoreValve Score in predicting mortality one-year post TAVR.  
Bicuspid Aortic Valve Morphology and Outcomes After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.  ;"BACKGROUND: Bicuspid aortic stenosis accounts for almost 50% of patients undergoing surgical aortic valve replacement in the younger patients. Expanding the indication of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) toward lower-risk and younger populations will lead to increased use of TAVR for patients with bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) stenosis despite the exclusion of bicuspid anatomy in all pivotal clinical trials. OBJECTIVES: This study sought to evaluate the association of BAV morphology and outcomes of TAVR with the new-generation devices. METHODS: Patients with BAV confirmed by central core laboratory computed tomography (CT) analysis were included from the international multicenter BAV TAVR registry. BAV morphology including the number of raphe, calcification grade in raphe, and leaflet calcium volume were assessed with CT analysis in a masked fashion. Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality at 1 and 2 years, and secondary outcomes included 30-day major endpoints and procedural complications. RESULTS: A total of 1,034 CT-confirmed BAV patients with a mean age of 74.7 years and Society of Thoracic Surgeons score of 3.7% underwent TAVR with contemporary devices (n = 740 with Sapien 3; n = 188 with Evolut R/Pro; n = 106 with others). All-cause 30-day, 1-year, and 2-year mortality was 2.0%, 6.7%, and 12.5%, respectively. Multivariable analysis identified calcified raphe and excess leaflet calcification (defined as more than median calcium volume) as independent predictors of 2-year all-cause mortality. Both calcified raphe plus excess leaflet calcification were found in 269 patients (26.0%), and they had significantly higher 2-year all-cause mortality than those with 1 or none of these morphological features (25.7% vs. 9.5% vs. 5.9%; log-rank p < 0.001). Patients with both morphological features had higher rates of aortic root injury (p < 0.001), moderate-to-severe paravalvular regurgitation (p = 0.002), and 30-day mortality (p = 0.016). CONCLUSIONS: Outcomes of TAVR in bicuspid aortic stenosis depend on valve morphology. Calcified raphe and excess leaflet calcification were associated with increased risk of procedural complications and midterm mortality.

Hypoplastic left heart syndrome with anomalous origin of right pulmonary artery.  ;Classic hypoplastic left heart syndrome is a rare but fatal congenital heart disease associated with variable underdevelopment of the left side of the heart. Complex forms of hypoplastic left heart syndrome have been reported to coexist with anomalous pulmonary venous drainage, transposition of the great arteries, or pulmonary valve dysplasia. We report a case of hypoplastic left heart syndrome with anomalous origin of the right pulmonary artery from the ascending aorta a rare association not reported in the literature. Preoperative comprehensive echocardiography is essential for diagnosis and accurate recognition of such rare anatomic variations.  
Mid-Term Results Comparing the Use of Artificial Chords Versus Native Chords for Mitral Valve Repair in Children.  ;"BACKGROUND: Our study is aimed at evaluating the mid-term surgical outcomes of mitral valve repair in children using various chordal reconstructive procedures (autologous in situ chords or artificial chords). METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 154 patients who underwent mitral valve repair using various chordal reconstructive procedures from 1992 to 2012. Patients were divided into group A and group B based on use of artificial chords and autologous in situ chords, respectively, for the repair. There were 102 (66.2%) patients in group A and 52 (33.8%) patients in group B. The mean age at repair was 11.1 ± 4.5 years. Associated cardiac anomalies were found in 94 (61%) patients. RESULTS: The median follow-up period was 4.2 years (Interquartile range: 2.0-9.9). There were two (1.3%) early deaths and five (3.2%) late deaths. There was no significant difference in survival at 15 years between the two groups (group A: 91.8% vs group B: 95.1%; P = .66). There was no significant difference in the freedom from reoperation at 15 years between group A (79.4%) and group B (97.2%; P = .06). However, there was significant difference in freedom from valve failure between group A (56.5%) and group B (74.1%; P = .03). Carpentier functional class III and postoperative residual mitral regurgitation (2+ MR, ie, mild-moderate MR) were the risk factors for valve failure. CONCLUSIONS: Severity of the disease and its progression has profound effect on the valve repair than the technique itself. Both chordal reconstructive procedures can be used to produce satisfactory results in children.  "
Concomitant Aortic Root Replacement With Anterior Konno Annular Enlargement.  ;The need for concomitant aortic annular enlargement and aortic root replacement may be necessary in situations of multilevel left ventricular outflow tract obstruction and/or prior aortic or aortic valve surgery, particularly in the setting of congenital heart disease. It can be extremely tedious and fraught with numerous complications. Major challenges include bleeding in difficult-to-reach areas and the potential need for subsequent operations. This article describes a technique of concomitant aortic annular enlargement and aortic root replacement that minimizes the risk of significant blood loss and facilitates future surgery should it be necessary.  
Impact of incorporating echocardiographic screening into a clinical prediction model to optimise utilisation of echocardiography in primary care.  ;INTRODUCTION: Access to public subspecialty healthcare is limited in underserved areas of Brazil, including echocardiography (echo). Long waiting lines and lack of a prioritisation system lead to diagnostic lag and may contribute to poor outcomes. We developed a prioritisation tool for use in primary care, aimed at improving resource utilisation, by predicting those at highest risk of having an abnormal echo, and thus in highest need of referral. METHODS: All patients in the existing primary care waiting list for echo were invited for participation and underwent a clinical questionnaire, simplified 7-view echo screening by non-physicians with handheld devices, and standard echo by experts. Two derivation models were developed, one including only clinical variables and a second including clinical variables and findings of major heart disease (HD) on echo screening (cut point for high/low-risk). For validation, patients were risk-classified according to the clinical score. High-risk patients and a sample of low-risk underwent standard echo. Intermediate-risk patients first had screening echo, with a standard echo if HD was suspected. Discrimination and calibration of the two models were assessed to predict HD in standard echo. RESULTS: In derivation (N = 603), clinical variables associated with HD were female gender, body mass index, Chagas disease, prior cardiac surgery, coronary disease, valve disease, hypertension and heart failure, and this model was well calibrated with C-statistic = 0.781. Performance was improved with the addition of echo screening, with C-statistic = 0.871 after cross-validation. For validation (N = 1526), 227 (14.9%) patients were classified as low risk, 1082 (70.9%) as intermediate risk and 217 (14.2%) as high risk by the clinical model. The final model with two categories had high sensitivity (99%) and negative predictive value (97%) for HD in standard echo. Model performance was good with C-statistic = 0.720. CONCLUSION: The addition of screening echo to clinical variables significantly improves the performance of a score to predict major HD.  
Risk modeling in transcatheter aortic valve replacement remains unsolved: an external validation study in 2946 German patients.  ;"BACKGROUND: Surgical risk prediction models are routinely used to guide decision-making for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). New and updated TAVR-specific models have been developed to improve risk stratification; however, the best option remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: To perform a comparative validation study of six risk models for the prediction of 30-day mortality in TAVR METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 2946 patients undergoing transfemoral (TF, n = 2625) or transapical (TA, n = 321) TAVR from 2008 to 2018 from the German Rhine Transregio Aortic Diseases cohort were included. Six surgical and TAVR-specific risk scoring models (LogES I, ES II, STS PROM, FRANCE-2, OBSERVANT, GAVS-II) were evaluated for the prediction of 30-day mortality. Observed 30-day mortality was 3.7% (TF 3.2%; TA 7.5%), mean 30-day mortality risk prediction varied from 5.8 ± 5.0% (OBSERVANT) to 23.4 ± 15.9% (LogES I). Discrimination performance (ROC analysis, c-indices) ranged from 0.60 (OBSERVANT) to 0.67 (STS PROM), without significant differences between models, between TF or TA approach or over time. STS PROM discriminated numerically best in TF TAVR (c-index 0.66; range of c-indices 0.60 to 0.66); performance was very similar in TA TAVR (LogES I, ES II, FRANCE-2 and GAVS-II all with c-index 0.67). Regarding calibration, all risk scoring models-especially LogES I-overestimated mortality risk, especially in high-risk patients. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical as well as TAVR-specific risk scoring models showed mediocre performance in prediction of 30-day mortality risk for TAVR in the German Rhine Transregio Aortic Diseases cohort. Development of new or updated risk models is necessary to improve risk stratification.  "
First-Degree Relatives Screening of Patients with Bicuspid Aortic Valve: Effectiveness and Feasibility in Pediatric Cardiology Daily Practice.  ;Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is the most common congenital heart disease. Since heritability is suspected, actual guidelines recommend to perform an echocardiographic assessment for first-degree relatives (FDR) of patient with BAV. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness and the feasibility of the current guidelines for the screening of FDR of patient with BAV in a pediatric cardiology daily practice. Consecutive patients with BAV and their FDR were prospectively included from January 2015 to March 2018 at Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Laval, Quebec City (Canada). Data were retrospectively collected and analyzed. A total of 713 FDR of 213 consecutives index cases [median age: 11 (6-20) years] were studied. Up to 32 (6.6%) FDR had a BAV and 26 (5.4%) had an aortic valve dysfunction. A total of 14 (2.9%) FDR had an ascending aorta dilatation according to Z-score including 6 (1.2%) patients with an ascending aorta ≥ 45 mm. No statistically significant differences regarding BAV, aortic valve dysfunction and ascending aorta dilatation prevalence were identified between generations. Screening was done in 482 (67.6%), prescribed but not done in 134 (19%), not prescribed in 92 (13%) and declined in 5 (1%) FDR. The prevalence of BAV in FDR was similar to prospective adult studies and supports actual guidelines in pediatric cardiology practice. Ascending aorta dilatation was rare in our young population. Exhaustiveness and additional burden to implement current guidelines remain a challenge in daily practice.  
Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors (ACEIs) Decrease the Progression of Cardiac Fibrosis in Rheumatic Heart Disease Through the Inhibition of IL-33/sST2.  ;"Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) is common in developing countries and poses a big medical challenge and burden. The pathogenesis of RHD is influenced by the triad of host, agent, and environment. Autoantigens generated from Group A Streptococcus (GAS) infection are captured by the resident dendritic cells (DCs) in the heart's valvular endothelium. DCs differentiate into antigen presenting cells (APC) in the valve interstices. APC induces activation of autoreactive T cells, which triggers inflammation and tissue fibrosis. Cardiac fibrosis is promoted through the activation of Mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and its downstream signaling, including its interaction with transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and Smad proteins. TGF-β-induced phosphorylation of Smad2 complexes with Smad3 and Smad4, and translocates into the nucleus. Angiotensin II enhances the migration, maturation, and presentation of DC. In RHD, Angiotensin II induces fibrosis via the stimulation of TGF-β, which further increases the binding of IL-33 to sST2 but not ST2L, resulting in the upregulation of Angiotensin II and progression of cardiac fibrosis. This cascade of inflammation and valvular fibrosis causes calcification and stiffening of the heart valves in RHD. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) inhibit Angiotensin II production, which in turn decreases TGF-β expression and the onset of overt inflammatory response. This condition leads to a reduction in the sST2 as the decoy receptor to ""steal"" IL-33, and IL-33 binds to ST2L and results in cardioprotection against cardiac fibrosis in the pathogenesis of RHD.

Pathogen influence on epidemiology, diagnostic evaluation and management of infective endocarditis.  ;Infective endocarditis (IE) is uncommon and has, in the past, been most often caused by viridans group streptococci (VGS). Due to the indolent nature of these organisms, the phrase 'subacute bacterial endocarditis', so-called 'SBE', was routinely used as it characterised the clinical course of most patients that extended for weeks to months. However, in more recent years, there has been a significant shift in the microbiology of IE with the emergence of staphylococci as the most frequent pathogens, and for IE due to Staphylococcus aureus, the clinical course is acute and can be associated with sepsis. Moreover, increases in IE due to enterococci have occurred and have been characterised by treatment-related complications and worse outcomes. These changes in pathogen distribution have been attributed to a diversification in the target population at risk of IE. While prosthetic valve endocarditis and history of IE remain at highest risk of IE, the rise in prevalence of injection drug use, intracardiac device implantations and other healthcare exposures have heavily contributed to the existing pool of at-risk patients. This review focuses on common IE pathogens and their impact on the clinical profile of IE.

A novel nonsense mutation in TNNT2 in a Chinese pedigree with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: A case report.  ;RATIONALE: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is an inherited myocardial disease and a common cause of sudden cardiac death, heart failure, atrial fibrillation and stroke. In families affected by HCM, genotyping is useful for identifying susceptible relatives. In the present study, we investigated the disease-causing mutations in a three-generation Chinese family with HCM using whole exome sequencing (WES). PATIENT CONCERNS: The proband, a 50-year-old man, was diagnosed with HCM at the age of 41 years. He presented with an asymmetric hypertrophic interventricular septum and a maximum interventricular septum thickness of 18.04 mm. His third elder sister, niece and daughter were also clinically affected by HCM. DIAGNOSIS: Autosomal dominant HCM. INTERVENTIONS: Seven family members, including 4 affected members, accepted WES. The genetic variants were subsequently called using Genome Analysis Toolkit and annotated using the InterVar program. Following frequency filtration by the Genome Aggregation Database, the variants were evaluated using an in-house bioinformatics analysis pipeline. OUTCOMES: HCM was transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait in the family. An extremely rare stop gained mutation, rs796925245 (g.1:201359630G>A, c.835C>T, p.Gln279Ter) in the troponin T2 (TNNT2) gene was identified as the disease-causing mutation. The stop gained mutation was predicted to result in a truncated troponin T protein in cardiac sarcomere. An adolescent family member who had normal echocardiographic measurements was found to carry the same disease-causing mutation. LESSONS: A novel nonsense TNNT2 mutation was identified as the HCM-causing mutation in this Chinese pedigree. Since HCM shows a low penetrance by clinical criteria in adolescents, the adolescent mutation carrier, who is still clinically unaffected, should be offered routine follow-ups and sport activity recommendations to prevent adverse events including sudden cardiac death in the future.  
Re-evaluation of the criteria for asymmetric amplatzer occluders in the closure of perimembranous ventricular septal defects: A case series report.  ;RATIONALE: To discuss suitable criteria for the application of asymmetric Amplatzer occluders for perimembranous ventricular septal defects (pmVSDs). PATIENTS CONCERNS AND DIAGNOSES: We retrospectively studied 18 children with perimembranous VSDs who underwent attempted asymmetric occluder closure between January 2015 and December 2018 in our center. INTERVENTIONS: Asymmetric Amplatzer occluders were attempted to be placed to all the enrolled patients. We analyzed the diameter of the defects with the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) values, the size of the occluders attempted, the presence of aneurysm and the presence of aortic valve prolapse for each patient. Then, for patients who experienced successful device implantation, the therapeutic efficiency was evaluated by follow-up. OUTCOMES: Only 5 out of a total of 18 patients completed successful device implantation. Compared with failed cases, successful cases demonstrated a significantly smaller VSD size (5.46 ± 1.03 mm vs. 8.73 ± 2.33 mm, P = 0.012) and had a low ratio of aortic valvar prolapse (20% vs. 76.92%, P = 0.026). Four out of 5 successful cases involved arrhythmia complications, but the rhythm of the heart recovered after drug treatment. According to the ROC and Youden analyses, the cut-off value of the defect size for successful asymmetric Amplatzer occluder implantation was no larger than 5.7 mm. LESSONS: The application of an asymmetric Amplatzer occluder expands the range of indications for patients with superior localized VSD but is largely limited in cases with aortic valvar prolapse and large VSD sizes. All successful cases recovered from arrhythmia postprocedure.  
AntagomiR-29b inhibits vascular and valvular calcification and improves heart function in rats.  ;We aimed to investigate the role of the miR-29b and its effect on TGF-β3 pathway in vascular and valvular calcification in a rat model of calcific aortic valve diseases (CAVD). A rat model of CAVD was established by administration of warfarin plus vitamin K. The expression levels of miR-29b, osteogenic markers and other genes were determined by qRT-PCR, Western blot and/or immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry. The calcium content and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity were measured. The calcium content, ALP activity and osteogenic markers levels in calcified aorta and aortic valve were augmented compared to controls. The expression of miR-29b, p-Smad3, and Wnt3 and β-catenin was significantly up-regulated, whereas TGF-β3 was markedly down-regulated. However, compared with the CAVD model group, the calcium content and ALP activity in rats treated with antagomiR-29b were significantly decreased, and antagomiR-29b administration reversed the effects of CAVD model on the expression of miR-29b and osteogenic markers. Inhibition of miR-29b in CAVD rats prevented from vascular and valvular calcification and induced TGF-β3 expression, suggesting that the miR-29b/TGF-β3 axis may play a regulatory role in the pathogenesis of vascular and valvular calcification and could play a significant role in the treatment of CAVD and other cardiovascular diseases.  
Adverse clinical outcomes in patients undergoing both PCI and TAVR: Analysis from a pooled multi-center registry.  ;"BACKGROUND: There is a paucity of data regarding the optimum timing of PCI in relation to TAVR. OBJECTIVE: We compared the major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) rates among patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) before transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) with those who received PCI with/after TAVR. METHODS: In this multicenter study, we pooled all consecutive patients who underwent TAVR at three high volume centers. RESULTS: Among 3,982 patients who underwent TAVR, 327 (8%) patients underwent PCI within 1 year before TAVR, 38 (1%) had PCI the same day as TAVR and 15 (0.5%) had PCI within 2 months after TAVR. Overall, among patients who received both PCI and TAVR (n = 380), history of previous CABG (HR:0.501; p = .001), higher BMI at TAVR (HR:0.970; p = .038), and statin therapy after TAVR (HR:0.660, p = .037) were independently associated with lower MACCE while warfarin therapy after TAVR was associated with a higher risk of MACCE (HR:1.779, p = .017). Patients who received PCI within 1 year before TAVR had similar baseline demographics, STS scores, clinical risk factors when compared to patients receiving PCI with/after TAVR. Both groups were similar in PCI (Syntax Score, ACC/AHA lesion class) and TAVR (valve types, access) related variables. There were no significant differences in terms of MACCE (log rank p = .550), all-cause mortality (log rank p = .433), strokes (log rank p = .153), and repeat PCI (log rank p = .054) in patients who underwent PCI with/after TAVR when compared to patients who received PCI before TAVR. CONCLUSION: Among patients who underwent both PCI and TAVR, history of CABG, higher BMI, and statin therapy had lower, while those discharged on warfarin, had higher adverse event rates. Adverse events rates were similar regardless of timing of PCI.  "
3D Echocardiography Is More Efficient In Detail Assessment of Calcification in Chronic Rheumatic Mitral Stenosis.  ;Rheumatic heart disease is in the declining phase, with the increase of urbanization and increment of availability of healthcare facility. However still it causes a substantial number of morbidity and mortality in South Asia. The prevalence of Rheumatic Fever and Rheumatic heart disease in Bangladesh is still high, 0.6 and 0.3 per thousand populations respectively. In the rheumatic process mitral is the frequently involved valve, mostly in the form of mitral stenosis. Choice of a treatment modality and its success largely depend on the accurate assessment of severity of disease especially the extent and distribution of calcification. Echocardiography has a key role in the determination of the severity of mitral stenosis as well as assessment of details calcification. Conventionally 2 dimensional and Doppler echocardiography is used. Now a days, 3D echocardiography offers better cardiac imaging for detail evaluation. The heart being a complex structure, the 3D evaluation would certainly offer better imaging for the accurate assessment of the mitral stenosis, especially details of presence & distribution calcification. This cross-sectional observational study was done from May 2012 to October 2012 in University Cardiac Centre, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU), Dhaka, Bangladesh. Data were collected with informed written consent, from 50 subjects who underwent transthoracic 2D and 3D Echocardiography for the assessment of rheumatic mitral valve with special emphasis on accurate assessment of severity, extent and distribution of calcification. Precise measurement of MV area is essential in the assessment of severity, which is found comparable by both 2DE (0.98±0.24cm²) and 3DE (0.92±0.23cm²). But in identifying calcification and accurate assessment of severity, more importantly commissural involvement is better detected by 3DE (p=0.002). This has extreme importance in therapeutic decision making in the treatment of chronic rheumatic MS. So, to formulate an efficient management plan, three-dimensional echocardiography has promising prospects in detecting severity & extent of rheumatic calcification.  
Comparison of long-term efficacy and safety between cilostazol and clopidogrel in chronic ischemic stroke: a nationwide cohort study.  ;BACKGROUND: Previous clinical trials showed a significant difference in efficacy and safety among antiplatelets in acute ischemic stroke (IS). The present study wished to compare the efficacy and safety head-to-head between cilostazol and clopidogrel in chronic IS. METHODS: This open prospective cohort study recruited chronic IS patients with an index hospitalization between 2001 and 2013 from Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. In the 504,191 hospitalized patients, patients who had missing information and history of atrial fibrillation or rheumatic heart disease, received mechanical valve replacement or anticoagulants, expired during the index hospitalization, received follow-up ⩽6 months, or had recurrent stroke within 6 months after index stroke were excluded. RESULTS: Among the 15,968 eligible patients, 502 patients who consistently received either cilostazol or clopidogrel from the 7th month after the index stroke were included for analysis after propensity score matching. The 3-year primary outcomes showed similar frequency of recurrent IS, all-cause mortality, and acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and similar frequency of intracerebral hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding, and major bleeding between the cilostazol and clopidogrel groups. Subgroup analysis revealed that patients with a history of hypertension or gastrointestinal bleeding had a trend of having lower frequency of recurrent IS or major bleeding, respectively, in the cilostazol group. CONCLUSION: The present real-world study demonstrated no significant difference in efficacy and safety between cilostazol and clopidogrel in chronic IS. However, cilostazol might be better than clopidogrel in patients with a history of hypertension or gastrointestinal bleeding.  
Impact of significant paravalvular leaks after transcatheter aortic valve implantation on anaemia and mortality.  ;"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this work is to assess the relationship between significant paravalvular leak (SPL) after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) on anaemia and their impact on prognosis. METHODS: Observational analytic study developed at two university hospitals, including all consecutive patients who underwent TAVI during a 10-year period (2009 to 2018). A logistic regression model was created to determine independent predictors of anaemia at 3 months. Time to event outcomes were analysed with Cox regression. Median follow-up was 21.3±21.9 months. RESULTS: 788 patients were included. 5.3% had SPL. SPL was an independent predictor of anaemia 3 months after TAVI (OR: 8.31, 95% CI: 2.06 to 33.50). SPL and anaemia at 3 months were independently associated with long-term mortality (HR: 1.82, 95% CI: 1.16 to 2.85; HR: 2.07, 95% CI: 1.39 to 3.08). CONCLUSION: SPL is an independent predictor of anaemia at 3 months after TAVI, a condition that doubles long-term mortality. Our findings could explain in part the worse prognosis of SPL after TAVI. Further pathophysiological studies are necessary to explain this association.  "
COVID-19 in an Adult With Tricuspid Atresia S/P Fontan Palliation.  ;In December 2019, a pathogenic novel human coronavirus (HCoV), termed SARS-CoV-2, was recognized in Wuhan, China, causing significant morbidity and mortality. The illness caused by SARS-CoV-2 is labelled coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization. We report the first case of COVID-19 in an adult congenital heart disease patient with single ventricle physiology S/P Fontan palliation. (Level of Difficulty: Advanced.).  
Heart Valves Cross-Linked with Erythrocyte Membrane Drug-Loaded Nanoparticles as a Biomimetic Strategy for Anti-coagulation, Anti-inflammation, Anti-calcification, and Endothelialization.  ;In recent years, valvular heart disease has become a serious disease threatening human life and is a major cause of death worldwide. However, the glutaraldehyde (GLU)-treated biological heart valves (BHVs) fail to meet all requirements of clinical application due to disadvantages such as valve thrombus, cytotoxicity, endothelialization difficulty, immune response, and calcification. Encouragingly, there are a large number of carboxyls as well as a few amino groups on the surface of GLU-treated BHVs that can be modified to enhance biocompatibility. Inspired by natural biological systems, we report a novel approach in which the heart valve was cross-linked with erythrocyte membrane biomimetic drug-loaded nanoparticles. Such modified heart valves not only preserved the structural integrity, stability, and mechanical properties of the GLU-treated BHVs but also greatly improved anti-coagulation, anti-inflammation, anti-calcification, and endothelialization. The in vitro results demonstrated that the modified heart valves had long-term anti-coagulation properties and enhanced endothelialization processes. The modified heart valves also showed good biocompatibility, including blood and cell biocompatibility. Most importantly, the modified heart valves reduced the TNF-α levels and increased IL-10 compared to GLU-treated BHVs. In vivo animal experiments also confirmed that the modified heart valves had an ultrastrong resistance to calcification after implantation in rats for 120 days. The mechanism of anti-calcification in vivo was mainly due to the controlled release of anti-inflammatory drugs that reduced the inflammatory response after valve implantation. In summary, this therapeutic approach based on BHVs cross-linking with erythrocyte membrane biomimetic nanoparticles sparks a novel design for valvular heart disease therapy.  
Sutureless and rapid deployment implantation in bicuspid aortic valve: results from the sutureless and rapid-deployment aortic valve replacement international registry.  ;BACKGROUND: Benefits of sutureless and rapid deployment (SURD) bioprostheses in bicuspid aortic valves (BAV) are controversial. The aim of this study is to report the outcomes of patients undergoing aortic valve replacement (AVR) for BAV from the Sutureless and Rapid-Deployment Aortic Valve Replacement International Registry (SURD-IR). METHODS: Of the 4,636 patients who received primary isolated SURD-AVR between 2007 and 2018, 191 (4.1%) BAV patients underwent AVR with SURD valve. RESULTS: Overall 30-day mortality was 1.6%. The Intuity valve was implanted in 53.9% of cases, whereas the Perceval was implanted in 46.1%. Rate of stroke for isolated AVR was 4.2%. No case of endocarditis, thromboembolism, myocardial infarction, valve dislocation or structural valve deterioration was reported in the early phase. Rate of pacemaker implantation and moderate-severe aortic regurgitation (AR) were 7.9% and 3.7%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: BAV is not considered a contraindication for the implantation of SURD valves. However, detailed information of aortic root geometry as well as the knowledge of some technical considerations are mandatory for a good outcome.  
Quantification of diffuse myocardial fibrosis using CMR extracellular volume fraction and serum biomarkers of collagen turnover with histologic quantification as standard of reference.  ;"PURPOSE: To compare the assessment of diffuse interstitial myocardial fibrosis in valvular diseases using cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) extracellular volume fraction (ECV) quantification and serum biomarkers of collagen turnover using results of myocardial biopsy as standard of reference. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective monocentric study included consecutive patients before aortic valvular replacement. All patients underwent: i), 1.5T CMR with pre and post contrast T1 mapping sequence and ECV computation; ii), serum quantification of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) and iii), myocardial biopsies were collected during surgery to assess collagen volume fraction (CVF). Patients with coronary artery disease were excluded. Correlation between native T1, ECV, CVF and serum biomarkers were assessed using Pearson correlation test. Agreement between basal anteroseptal ECV with global ECV was assessed using Bland-Altman test. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients, 16 with aortic stenosis and 5 with aortic regurgitation were included. There were 12 men and 9 women with a mean age of 74.1±6.8 (SD) years (range: 32-84 years). Mean global ECV value was 26.7±2.7 (SD) % (range: 23.4-32.5%) and mean CVF value was 12.4±9.7% (range: 3.2-25.7%). ECV assessed at the basal anteroseptal segment correlated moderately with CVF (r=0.6; P=0.0026). There was a strong correlation and agreement between basal anteroseptal ECV and global ECV, (r=0.8; P<0.0001; bias 5.4±6.1%) but no correlation between global ECV and CVF (r=0.5; P=0.10). Global ECV poorly correlated with serum TIMP-1 (r=0.4; P=0.037) and MMP-2 (r=0.4; P=0.047). No correlation was found between serum biomarkers and basal anteroseptal- ECV or native T1. CONCLUSION: In patients with severe aortic valvulopathy, diffuse myocardial fibrosis assessed by anterosepto-basal ECV correlates with histological myocardial fibrosis. Anteroseptobasal ECV strongly correlates with global ECV, which poorly correlates with TIMP-1 and MMP-2, serum biomarkers involved in the progression of heart failure.  "
Diffuse Myocardial Fibrosis and Diastolic Function in Aortic Stenosis.  ;"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between extracellular volume fraction (ECV), a noninvasive parameter that quantifies the degree of diffuse myocardial fibrosis on cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), and left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (LVDD) in patients with aortic stenosis (AS). BACKGROUND: Myocardial fibrosis on invasive myocardial biopsy is associated with LVDD. However, there is a paucity of data on the association between noninvasively quantified diffuse myocardial fibrosis and the degree of LVDD and how these are related to symptoms and long-term prognosis in patients with AS. METHODS: Patients with moderate or severe AS (n = 191; mean age 68.4 years) and 30 control subjects without cardiovascular risk factors underwent CMR. LVDD grade was evaluated using echocardiography according to the 2016 American Society of Echocardiography/European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging guidelines. Clinical outcomes were defined as a composite of all-cause mortality or hospitalization for heart failure aggravation. RESULTS: Patients in higher ECV quintiles had a significantly higher prevalence of LVDD. Higher ECV was particularly associated with decreased myocardial relaxation (septal e' <7 cm/s) and increased LV filling pressure (E/e' ratio ≥15). Although both impaired diastolic function and higher ECV were significantly associated with a worse degree of dyspnea, patients with higher ECV showed greater dyspnea within the same grade of LVDD. During a median follow-up period of 5.6 years, 37 clinical events occurred. Increased ECV, as well as lower septal e' and higher E/septal e' ratio, were independent predictors of clinical events, irrespective of age, AS severity, aortic valve replacement, and left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction. ECV provided incremental prognostic value on top of clinical factors and LV systolic and diastolic function. CONCLUSIONS: Diffuse myocardial fibrosis, assessed using ECV on CMR, was associated with LVDD in patients with AS, but both ECV and LV diastolic function parameters provided a complementary explanation for dyspnea and clinical outcomes. Concomitant assessment of both LVDD and diffuse myocardial fibrosis may further identify patients with AS with greater symptoms and worse prognosis.  "
Brown KN(1), Kanmanthareddy A(2).  ;"Mitral stenosis (MS) is a common valvular disorder. Despite advances in modern medicine, rheumatic heart disease (RHD) remains the most common cause of mitral stenosis. It usually presents in patients between 20 and 40 years of age and about 10 to 15 years after the onset of rheumatic fever. In the United States, mitral stenosis secondary to RHD most commonly presents in the immigrant population and the impoverished with limited access to healthcare. Calcific degenerative mitral valve stenosis disease (DMS) is another cause of mitral stenosis but is far less common and more often seen in the elderly. Patients with symptomatic mitral stenosis usually present with symptoms of heart failure, atrial fibrillation, or thromboembolism. Risk factors for mitral stenosis include a history of rheumatic fever and/or a previously untreated streptococcus infection. Some data exists suggesting that patients on dialysis are at increased risk for mitral stenosis. Physical examination may reveal prominent a wave in the jugular pulse, prominent tapping apical pulse, signs of right-heart failure, accentuation of the P2, an opening snap, and the classic low-pitched, rumbling diastolic murmur with presystolic accentuation. A chest radiograph may show prominence of the pulmonary arteries, left atrium, right ventricle, and right atrium which is a result of the build of pressure behind the valve. The electrocardiogram may show right ventricle hypertrophy along with a notched p-wave with a duration of >0.12 seconds in lead II; this is referred to a P mitrale. The diagnostic test of choice for percutaneous transcatheter mitral valve replacement (PMVR) remains to be the echocardiogram. While surgery is the procedure of choice for severe, symptomatic mitral stenosis, another option for patients not deemed candidates for open heart surgery is percutaneous transcatheter balloon mitral valvuloplasty (PBMV). However, these patients must also have suitable mitral valve anatomy on echocardiogram. Other transcatheter procedures have been developed. Valves designed for transcatheter aortic valve replacement have been used to treat degenerative mitral stenosis in a procedure called percutaneous transcatheter mitral valve replacement (PMVR).  This chapter will describe in detail the mitral valve, pathology of mitral stenosis, possible options for catheter management for mitral stenosis, indications, contraindications, Wilkins scoring system, techniques, complications, and the clinical significance of catheter management of mitral stenosis.

Bleeding Complications Drive In-Hospital Mortality of Patients with Atrial Fibrillation after Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.  ;BACKGROUND:  Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a risk factor for poor postoperative outcome after transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TF-TAVR). The present study analyses the outcomes after TF-TAVR in patients with or without AF and identifies independent predictors for in-hospital mortality in clinical practice. METHODS AND RESULTS:  Among all 57,050 patients undergoing isolated TF-TAVR between 2008 and 2016 in Germany, 44.2% of patients (n = 25,309) had AF. Patients with AF were at higher risk for unfavorable in-hospital outcome after TAVR. Including all baseline characteristics for a risk-adjusted comparison, AF was an independent risk factor for in-hospital mortality after TAVR. Among patients with AF, EuroSCORE, New York Heart Association classification class, or renal disease had only moderate effects on mortality, while the occurrence of postprocedural stroke or moderate to major bleeding substantially increased in-hospital mortality (odds ratio [OR] 3.35, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.61-4.30, p < 0.001 and OR 3.12, 95% CI 2.68-3.62, p < 0.001). However, the strongest independent predictor for in-hospital mortality among patients with AF was severe bleeding (OR 18.00, 95% CI 15.22-21.30, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION:  The present study demonstrates that the incidence of bleeding defines the in-hospital outcome of patients with AF after TF-TAVR. Thus, the periprocedural phase demands particular care in bleeding prevention.  
Outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve replacement for patients with severe aortic stenosis and concomitant aortic insufficiency: Insights from the TVT Registry.  ;"AIMS: Data regarding outcomes for patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) with concomitant aortic insufficiency (AI), undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) are limited. This study aimed to analyze the prevalence of severe AS with concomitant AI among patients undergoing TAVR and outcomes of TAVR in this patient group. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using data from the STS/ACC-TVT Registry, we identified patients with severe AS with or without concomitant AI who underwent TAVR between 2011 and 2016. Patients were categorized based on the severity of pre-procedural AI. Multivariable proportional hazards regression models were used to examine all-cause mortality and heart failure (HF) hospitalization at 1-year. Among 54,535 patients undergoing TAVR, 42,568 (78.1%) had severe AS with concomitant AI. Device success was lower in patients with severe AS with concomitant AI as compared with isolated AS. The presence of baseline AI was associated with lower 1 year mortality (HR 0.94 per 1 grade increase in AI severity; 95% CI, 0.91-0.98, P < .001) and HF hospitalization (HR 0.87 per 1 grade increase in AI severity; 95% CI, 0.84-0.91, P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Severe AS with concomitant AI is common among patients undergoing TAVR, and is associated with lower 1 year mortality and HF hospitalization. Future studies are warranted to better understand the mechanisms underlying this benefit. SHORT ABSTRACT: In this nationally representative analysis from the United States, 78.1% of patients undergoing TAVR had severe AS with concomitant AI. Device success was lower in patients with severe AS with concomitant AI as compared with isolated AS. The presence of baseline AI was associated with lower 1 year mortality (HR 0.94 per 1 grade increase in AI severity; 95% CI, 0.91-0.98, P < .001) and HF hospitalization (HR 0.87 per 1 grade increase in AI severity; 95% CI, 0.84-0.91, P < .001).

The fate of active left-side infective endocarditis with operative indication in absence of valve surgery.  ;OBJECTIVES: Although the benefits of surgery in infective endocarditis (IE) are clear, an unneglectable proportion of patients do not undergo surgery despite clear operative indication. Outcomes of these patients are poorly reported. With this study, we aim to analyze patient profiles, indication for surgery, decision-making, and outcomes of patients not undergoing surgery despite contemporary surgical indications. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective review of single institution database of patients with IE was done to identify patients that, although a clear surgical indication did not receive surgery. We aimed to review the most contemporary practice from June 2014 to December 2018. Only patients who were physically evaluated at our facility were included. Follow up was 100% complete. Kaplan-Meier methods were used to estimate survival and freedom from a composite outcome of death, stroke, and heart failure. RESULTS: Of the 174 patients with surgical indication during the review period, 46 (27%) did not undergo surgery. The reasons for not pursuing surgery were varied and usually multiple, with severe brain injury and end stage liver disease between the most common. The 30-day mortality was 63%, and the estimated survival at 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years was respectively 22%, 15%, and 10%. CONCLUSION: The mortality of this cohort of patients is extremely high. A multidisciplinary evaluation is of paramount importance in the decision-making process with shared responsibility for denial of operative options. In a perspective of correct healthcare resources allocation an early palliative care consult may need to be considered in some of those patients.  
Surgical left atrial appendage occlusion in patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing mechanical heart valve replacement.  ;"BACKGROUND: Surgical left atrial appendage occlusion (SLAAO) may be associated with a lower risk of thromboembolism in patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing cardiac surgery. However, evidence regarding the effectiveness of SLAAO in patients undergoing mechanical heart valve replacement (MHVR) is lacking. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the association between SLAAO and the cardiovascular outcomes in patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing MHVR. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data for 497 patients with atrial fibrillation; 27.6% of the patients underwent SLAAO, and the remainder of the patients did not (No-SLAAO group). The primary outcome was a composite of ischemic stroke, systemic embolism, and all-cause mortality. Cumulative event-free survival rates were estimated using Kaplan-Meier curves, and we performed multivariate Cox analyses to evaluate the association between SLAAO and outcomes. We used one-to-one propensity score matching to balance patients' baseline characteristics, and analyzed 120 matching pairs. RESULTS: Five patients died within 30 days postoperatively, and there were no significant differences between the two groups regarding in-hospital complications (all P > 0.05). After a median follow-up of 14 months, 14 primary events occurred. Kaplan-Meier curves showed no difference in the cumulative incidence of freedom from the primary outcome (log-rank P = 0.830), hemorrhagic events (log-rank P = 0.870), and the secondary outcome (log-rank P = 0.730), between the two groups. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analysis showed no association between SLAAO and any outcome (all P > 0.05). After propensity score matching, cardiopulmonary bypass time and aortic cross-clamp time, and the postoperative length of stay were significantly longer in the SLAAO group (all P < 0.05); results were similar to the unadjusted analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Concomitant SLAAO and MHVR was associated with longer length of stay, and cardiopulmonary bypass time and aortic cross-clamp time, but was not associated with additional protective effects against thromboembolic events and mortality during the 14-month follow-up.

Early Valve Replacement for Severe Aortic Valve Disease: Effect on Mortality and Clinical Ramifications.  ;Timing of aortic valve intervention for chronic aortic regurgitation (AR) and/or aortic stenosis (AS) potentially affects long-term survival. The 2014 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) guidelines provide recommendations for the timing of intervention. Subsequent to the guidelines' release, several studies have been published that suggest a survival benefit from earlier timing of surgery for severe AR and/or AS. The aim of this review was to determine whether patients who have chronic aortic regurgitation (AR) and/or aortic stenosis (AS) have a survival benefit from earlier timing of aortic valve surgery. Medical databases were systematically searched from January 2015 to April 2020 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies that examined the timing of aortic valve replacement surgery for chronic AR and/or AS. For chronic AR, four observational studies and no RCTs were identified. For chronic AS, five observational studies, one RCT and one meta-analysis were identified. One observational study examining mixed aortic valve disease (MAVD) was identified. All of these studies, for AR, AS, and MAVD, found long-term survival benefit from timing of aortic valve surgery earlier than the current guidelines. Larger prospective RCTs are required to evaluate the benefit of earlier surgical intervention.  
Clonal Hematopoiesis of Indeterminate Potential: A Multidisciplinary Challenge in Personalized Hematology.  ;"Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) is a common age-related condition that represents a potential pre-phase of hematologic neoplasm. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is used to detect and monitor clonal hematopoiesis, and the spectrum of mutations substantially overlaps with that of myeloid neoplasms with DNMT3A, TET2, ASXL1, and JAK2 being the most frequently mutated. While, in general, the risk of progression to an overt myeloid neoplasm is only modest, the progression risk increases in patients with unexplained cytopenia or multiple mutations. In addition, CHIP represents a previously unrecognized major risk factor for atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease (CVD), including coronary heart disease, degenerative aortic valve stenosis, and chronic heart failure; and a causative role of CHIP in the development of CVD has been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo. The management of patients with CHIP is a rapidly emerging topic in personalized medicine, as NGS has become widely available for clinical medicine. It requires a highly multidisciplinary setting, including hematology/oncology, cardiology, (clinical) pathology, and genetics for individualized guidance. Further research is urgently needed to provide robust evidence for future guidelines and recommendations on the management of patients with CHIP in the era of personalized medicine.  "
Echocardiographic Evaluation of the Mitral Valve in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels.  ;"This prospective cross-sectional study aimed to: (1) characterize echocardiographic features of mitral valve in MMVD affected Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCS), focusing on dogs classified as American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine (ACVIM) class B1; (2) compare echocardiographic data in ACVIM B1 dogs divided on the basis of age at time of MMVD diagnosis, in order to understand if different aged subjects had different echocardiographic patterns. Length (AMVL), width (AMVW) and area (AMVA) of the anterior mitral valve leaflet, mitral valve prolapse, diameters of the mitral valve annulus in diastole (MVAd) and systole (MVAs) of 90 CKCS in different ACVIM classes, 64 of which in class B1, were measured. Valvular measurements were indexed to body weight using Wesselowski's scaling exponents. The presence of heart murmur did not discriminate between A and B1 classes (p = 0.128). Heart enlargement was more frequent in males (r2 = 0.07, p = 0.013). Within class B1, older subjects showed significantly higher values of AMVA, AMVW, MVAd, MVAs and lower sphericity index (SI). Since many CKCS with MMVD have no murmur and their mitral valve has peculiarities, a specifically designed echocardiographic screening should be realized. In addition, different aged B1 dogs have different echocardiographic patterns that may imply different genetic and prognostic profiles.  "
Smooth Muscle α-Actin Expression in Mitral Valve Interstitial Cells is Important for Mediating Extracellular Matrix Remodeling.  ;"BACKGROUND: Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) affects 3-6% of the total population including those with connective tissue disorders. Treatment is limited, and patients commonly require surgery which can be impermanent and insuperable. Abnormal prolapse of mitral valve leaflets into the left atria is caused by disturbances to the composition and organization of the extracellular matrix (ECM), that weaken biomechanics. This process, known as myxomatous degeneration is characterized by an abnormal accumulation of proteoglycans, in addition to collagen fiber disruption and elastic fiber fragmentation. The underlying mechanisms that promote myxomatous degeneration to the point of biomechanical failure are unknown, but previous histological studies of end-stage diseased tissue have reported abnormal α-smooth muscle actin (SMA) in a subset of heart valve interstitial cells (VICs); however, the contribution of these abnormal cells to MVP pathogenesis has not been extensively examined. METHODS: In vivo and in vitro approaches were used. Mice harboring a Fbn1C1039G mutation mimic human Marfan Syndrome and develop MVP. Using these mice, temporal and spatial changes in SMA expression relative to myxomatous degeneration were examined using histological techniques. In parallel in vitro experiments, SMA expression was downregulated in primary porcine mitral VICs directly using siRNA, and indirectly using the actin depolymerizing agent Latrunculin A. In addition, the regulation of SMA in VICs by mechanical stiffness was explored relative to ECM remodeling. RESULTS: We show, in mitral valves from Fbn1C1039G/+ mice, that abnormal increases in SMA expression in VICs are evident during early postnatal stages of disease, prior to significant myxomatous degeneration as indicated at later stages by increased proteoglycans and collagen type I (Col1a1). Furthermore, abnormal SMA expression continues to increase during the course of pathogenesis and is localized to the mid belly region of the mitral valve leaflets from 10 weeks. Using an in vitro approach, we demonstrate that reduced SMA function by direct siRNA or indirect Latrunculin A treatment attenuates proteoglycan and Col1a1 expression in porcine mitral VICs. While upstream, we provide insights to show that SMA is regulated by mechanical tension in VICs to promote changes in ECM homeostasis. CONCLUSIONS: Together, our data show that in VICs, SMA, an actin binding protein, is important for mediating ECM remodeling associated with phenotypes observed in myxomatous degeneration, and its expression is regulated by mechanical tension. These novel insights could inform the development of future non-surgical therapeutics to halt the progression of mitral valve degeneration thereby avoiding end-stage prolapse.  "
Dynamic Expression Profiles of β-Catenin during Murine Cardiac Valve Development.  ;β-catenin has been widely studied in many animal and organ systems across evolution, and gain or loss of function has been linked to a number of human diseases. Yet fundamental knowledge regarding its protein expression and localization remains poorly described. Thus, we sought to define whether there was a temporal and cell-specific regulation of β-catenin activities that correlate with distinct cardiac morphological events. Our findings indicate that activated nuclear β-catenin is primarily evident early in gestation. As development proceeds, nuclear β-catenin is down-regulated and becomes restricted to the membrane in a subset of cardiac progenitor cells. After birth, little β-catenin is detected in the heart. The co-expression of β-catenin with its main transcriptional co-factor, Lef1, revealed that Lef1 and β-catenin expression domains do not extensively overlap in the cardiac valves. These data indicate mutually exclusive roles for Lef1 and β-catenin in most cardiac cell types during development. Additionally, these data indicate diverse functions for β-catenin within the nucleus and membrane depending on cell type and gestational timing. Cardiovascular studies should take into careful consideration both nuclear and membrane β-catenin functions and their potential contributions to cardiac development and disease.  
A Novel Approach for Detecting Unique Variations among Infectious Bacterial Species in Endocarditic Cardiac Valve Vegetation.  ;Infectious endocarditis (IE) remains one of the deadliest heart diseases with a high death rate, generally following thrombo-embolic events. Today, therapy is based on surgery and antibiotic therapy. When thromboembolic complications in IE patients persist, this is often due to our lack of knowledge regarding the pathophysiological development and organization of cells in the vegetation, most notably the primordial role of platelets and further triggered hemostasis, which is related to the diversity of infectious microorganisms involved. Our objective was to study the organization of IE vegetations due to different bacteria species in order to understand the related pathophysiological mechanism of vegetation development. We present an approach for ultrastructural analysis of whole-infected heart valve tissue based on scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Our approach allowed us to detect differences in cell organization between the analyzed vegetations and revealed a distinct chemical feature in viridans Streptococci ones. Our results illustrate the benefits that such an approach may bring for guiding therapy, considering the germ involved for each IE patient.  
Prevalence and progression of aortic dilatation in adult patients with Turner syndrome: a cohort study.  ;OBJECTIVE: Turner syndrome (TS) is a rare disorder affecting 1/2500 female newborn. Aortic dilatation (AD) and aortic dissection represent a major concern in TS. The aims of our study were to describe the aortic root growth, potential aortic dilatation (AD) risk factors and cardiovascular outcomes in a cohort of patients with TS. METHODS: Among 204 adult patients included, 197 were studied using a standardized 1.5 Tesla MRI protocol. AD was defined as an aortic diameter ≥20 mm/m2 at the Valsalva sinuses and/or at the ascending aorta, when indexed to body surface area. RESULTS: At baseline, AD was present in 81/197 (41.1%) and 32/197 (16.2%) of patients, at the levels of Valsalva and ascending aorta, respectively. The aortic Valsalva diameter was larger in patients treated for thyroiditis (P < 0.001). Potential risk factors of AD were aging (P < 0.001) and the presence of bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) (P = 0.002). The hazard ratio (HR) of AD occurrence in the presence of BAV was 2.2 (95% CI: 1.33-3.71). After a median follow-up period of 5.1 years (n = 143), AD was present in 58/143 (40.6%) and 25/143 (17.5%) of patients at the levels of Valsalva and ascending aorta, respectively. The median aortic growth of the Valsalva sinuses remained stable. At the ascending aorta, it increased by 0.14 ± 0.61 mm/year. Only one aortic-related death was observed. CONCLUSION: AD is common in adult patients with TS. However, our results are rather reassuring, as the median aortic diameters remained stable after 5.1 years and few aortic events were observed.  
Biomarker changes with systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve in cats with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  ;"BACKGROUND: N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and cardiac troponin-I (cTnI) are biomarkers commonly evaluated in cats with suspected heart disease. Many cats with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) have systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve (SAM), but its influence on circulating NT-proBNP or cTnI concentrations is currently unknown. HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: Cats with HCM and SAM (HCMSAM+ ) have higher NT-proBNP and cTnI concentrations than do cats with HCM but without SAM (HCMSAM- ). ANIMALS: One hundred forty cats with HCM: 70 with SAM and 70 without SAM. METHODS: Retrospective case-to-case study. Cats were recruited if diagnosed with HCM by echocardiography and results were available for NT-proBNP or cTnI concentrations or both. Cats with SAM were matched to those without SAM for clinical presentation, left atrial (LA) size and left ventricular (LV) fractional shortening. RESULTS: A total of 119 NT-proBNP and 123 cTnI results were available. The HCMSAM+ cats had higher median concentrations than did HCMSAM- cats for NT-proBNP (729 pmoL/L; interquartile range [IQR], 275-1467 versus 65 pmoL/L; IQR, 25-271; P < .001) and cTnI (0.27 ng/mL; IQR, 0.10-0.81 versus 0.07 ng/mL; IQR, 0.01-0.43; P = .002). In general linear models for both NT-proBNP and cTnI, the independent explanatory variables were SAM, congestive heart failure, maximal LV wall thickness, and LA size. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: For cats with HCM and equivalent LA size and LV systolic function, those with SAM had higher NT-proBNP and cTnI concentrations than did those without SAM. Presence of SAM should be considered when interpreting biomarker concentrations in cats with HCM.  "
Ramjattan NA(1), Lala V(2), Kousa O(3), Makaryus AN(4).  ;Chest pain is often the herald of cardiovascular disease and is one of the most common diagnostic challenges encountered by practicing clinicians. Cardiovascular disease remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, despite advances in medical and procedural therapies. Coronary artery disease (CAD) is an important subset of cardiovascular disease that requires timely, accurate, and cost-effective diagnosis. Patients can be classified into low, intermediate, and high pre-test probability of ischemic heart disease groups based on presenting symptoms, history, physical exam findings, ECG changes, and cardiac enzyme profiles. After acute coronary syndrome has been ruled out, the clinician has an abundance of diagnostic options to choose from when aiming to determine the presence of CAD and quantify its extent in these patients. Coronary computed tomographic angiography (CCTA) is an anatomic test that can be used in intermediate-risk patients to provide a diagnostician with these answers quickly. While invasive coronary angiography remains the gold standard in the diagnosis of coronary artery disease, CCTA has increasingly become a viable non-invasive alternative. CCTA avoids the risks associated with an invasive procedure, in addition to providing a more expeditious and possibly more cost-effective means of assessing patients at intermediate risk for CAD. Epicardial coronary arteries are moving structures that are typically millimeters in diameter. Because of this, CCTA requires both good spatial and temporal resolution to adequately visualize. Spatial resolution refers to the smallest distance across which two points can be differentiated. Temporal resolution refers to how quickly images of a moving structure can be acquired. Starting with the availability of 64-slice multi-detector CT (64-MDCT) systems, and now with even more modern technologies, CCTA has achieved the temporal and spatial resolution to be able to define the lumen of even distal segments of the coronary artery tree. Studies assessing the diagnostic performance of CCTA have typically compared its ability to detect significant coronary lesions (blockage of greater than 50%) versus lesions discovered in those same patients on subsequent invasive coronary angiography. Initial studies of 64-MDCT showed a diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 94%, 97%, 87%, and 99% respectively.  These initial studies typically excluded patients with atrial fibrillation, atrial premature contractions, ventricular premature contractions, prior history of CAD, and inability to tolerate beta-blockade. A study inclusive of these patients had 93% and 97% specificity and negative predictive value at assessing segmental coronary artery stenosis greater than 50%. CCTA protocols typically involve an initial non-contrast, low-radiation dose phase. This non-contrast portion of the study can yield high-quality data about cardiac anatomical structures that may not be as adequately visualized with other non-invasive imaging modalities, e.g., trans-thoracic echocardiography or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. This can be particularly useful in diagnosis and management of adult congenital heart disease (CHD). Simple CHD includes an atrial septal defect, patent foramen ovale, ventricular septal defect, and bicuspid aortic valve. Complex CHD can also be with reasonable accuracy, including Ebstein’s anomaly, truncus arteriosus, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, transposition of great arteries, Tetralogy of Fallot, tricuspid atresia. Specifically, with cases of complex CHD, many of these patients benefit from surgical repair and can survive to adulthood. Cardiac CT provides an accurate, timely, and cost-effective means of initial diagnosis and follow-up care in these patients. Another utility of the non-contrast portion of a CCTA is the ability to calculate a coronary artery calcium (CAC) score. Also known as an Agatston score, a CAC score can be used to risk stratify patients into low, intermediate, and high-risk groups for future development of CAD. CAC scores were thought to be useful in identifying asymptomatic patients where more intensive preventative treatment regimens would be appropriate. Indeed, the most recent (2013) Multimodality Appropriate Use Criteria for the Detection of Stable Ischemic Heart Disease guidelines from the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) suggested that CAC scoring may be appropriate in select patients who are asymptomatic but at intermediate risk for CAD. However, CAC scoring alone is rarely appropriate in symptomatic patients. By the guidelines, CCTA may be the more appropriate diagnostic tool for symptomatic patients with an intermediate pre-test probability of coronary disease. CAC scores are commonly tabulated during the initial non-contrast phase of a CCTA by assigning a weighted density score to the location of calcium with the highest attenuation (measured in Hounsfield units) and then multiplying by the area of calcification. CAC scores of 0, 1 to 10, 11 to 100, 101 to 400, greater than 400 represent no, mild, moderate, and severe CAD, respectively. Patients with CAC scores of 0 or 1 to 10 have a very low lifetime risk of having an adverse cardiovascular event. However, studies have shown that patients with mild CAC scores of 1 to 10 are at threefold risk of developing CAD compared to patients with CAC scores of zero. These findings have to lead to an additional investigation into the roles of non-calcified coronary artery plaque, rapid atherosclerosis, and plaque destabilization in the development of coronary heart disease.  These additional plaque features are difficult to assess via CAC scoring alone.  This is particularly true in the case of non-calcified coronary artery plaques, which can range from non-obstructive to significantly stenotic. CCTA can also be applied towards the diagnosis of coronary anomalies.  As with CAD, invasive coronary angiography has been the diagnostic gold standard.  However, with the available temporal and spatial resolution offered by modern CT scanners, CCTA has emerged as a viable non-invasive alternative means of surveying coronary anatomy.  Professional guidelines from the ACC/AHA released in 2008 listed CCTA as a class I indication for initial screening of adult patients with suspected congenital anomalous coronary arteries of ectopic origin.  Coronary anomalies are only present in less than 1% of the population, and their presentations can range from benign, incidental findings, to dramatic, as in the case of sudden cardiac death. Anomalous coronary arteries are classified into three general groups: anomalies of origin and course, intrinsic coronary anatomy anomalies, and artery termination anomalies. In addition to assessment of coronary anatomy, CCTA also allows three-dimensional assessment of the entire heart and spatial arrangements of anomalous coronaries, which can, in turn, provide prognostic information. Newer CCTA applications in the areas of perfusion and fractional flow reserve are on the horizon and are set to expand the diagnostic utility of cardiac CT. Additionally, transcatheter structural invasive procedures are now routinely performed, and these procedures are guided by noninvasive cardiac imaging specifically with CCTA pre-procedurally.  
The role of multimodality imaging in HIV-related heart disease.  ;DOI: 10.1007/s12350-020-02291-1 PMID: 32820425  
Shifting Paradigms in Cardiovascular Therapeutic Strategies During the COVID-19 Era.  ;The coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) period have dictated a different approach to cardiac interventions at our medical institution. We prioritize emergent care geared toward lesser invasive approaches while minimizing hospitalization duration. This reflects upon coronary and structural/valvular cases altogether. Despite potential criticism of this approach, we believe it is the most appropriate therapeutic strategy for this unique period. Further investigation is needed to examine the external validity of our approach in other medical centers worldwide.  
Role of Teleproctoring in Challenging and Innovative Structural Interventions Amid the COVID-19 Pandemic and Beyond.  ;Teleproctoring can be used successfully in performing challenging and innovative structural heart interventions using sophisticated technology that allows real-time bidirectional audiovisual communication with digital transmission of live videos and direct observation of the operative field by a remote proctor. The authors share an illustrative case that was performed amid the coronavirus disease-2019 global pandemic that led to travel restrictions to limit spread of the virus. Teleproctoring has future implications beyond the current global health crisis to facilitate rapid dissemination and exchange of knowledge for ultimately helping patients around the globe.  
Characterisation of aortic stenosis severity: a retrospective analysis of echocardiography reports in a clinical laboratory.  ;OBJECTIVE: To evaluate how common echocardiographic metrics of aortic stenosis (AS) influence the proportion of patients who may be categorised as having severe stenosis and therefore considered for valve replacement. METHODS: Retrospective analysis was performed of all echocardiograms with aortic valve area (AVA) ≤1.2 cm2 and peak jet velocity (Vmax) ≥3 m/s from 1 December 2014 through 30 October 2017 at a single academic medical centre. Echocardiographic indices collected include AVA, Vmax, left ventricular ejection fraction, stroke volume and annotated aortic stenosis severity. RESULTS: Among 807 patients with AVA ≤1.2 cm2 and Vmax ≥3 m/s (44.0% female, median age 74 years (IQR: 66-81)), 45.6% had Vmax ≥4 m/s, while 75.8% had AVA ≤1 cm2. 40.0% of patients had concordant indices (Vmax ≥4 m/s and AVA ≤1 cm2), and 35.8% had discordant indices (Vmax <4 m/s and AVA ≤1 cm2) of severe AS. Compared with those with concordant indices, patients with discordant indices were more commonly female (54.0% vs 44.3%, p<0.05) and less commonly characterised as severe (42.6% vs 93.8%, p<0.001). Patients with paradoxical low-flow, low-gradient severe AS by echocardiography were disproportionately female (61.5% vs 41.8%, p<0.001), and their disease was characterised as severe only 49.5% of the time. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with discordant indices, who are disproportionately female, are commonly described in clinical echocardiography reports as having less than severe AS. Given the potential benefit of AVR in patients with AVA ≤1 cm2 regardless of Vmax, this could have important clinical implications.  
From Other Journals: A Review of Recent Articles in Pediatric Cardiology.  ;In this review, we provide a brief description of recently published articles addressing topics relevant to pediatric cardiologists. Our aim is to provide a summary of the latest articles published recently in other journals in our field. The articles address (1) cardiac resynchronization in children with symptomatic ventricular dysfunction and dyssynchrony which seems to result in higher transplant-free survival, (2) outcomes of aortic leaflet reconstruction including Ozaki procedure to repair aortic valve disease in adolescents, (3) meta-analysis for risk factors of ventricular tachycardia and death after repaired tetralogy of Fallot which reiterates the known risk factors and showed that the severity of pulmonary regurgitation is not in itself associated with outcomes although the ventricular response to regurgitation (dilation and dysfunction) is, (4) preschool promotion of healthy life style did not associate with sustained effect when evaluated later in childhood although repeated intervention seems to have a dose-related effect to promote healthy life style, (5) the lack of beneficial effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in the interstage period, and (6) a new phenomenon of acute heart failure and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children temporarily related to the COVID-19 pandemic.  
A 3-dimensional-printed left ventricle model incorporated into a mock circulatory loop to investigate hemodynamics inside a severely failing ventricle supported by a blood pump.  ;Intraventricular blood stasis is a design consideration for continuous flow blood pumps and might contribute to adverse events such as thrombosis and ventricular suction. However, the blood flow inside left ventricles (LVs) supported by blood pumps is still unclear. In vitro experiments were conducted to imitate how the hydraulic performance of an axial blood pump affects the intraventricular blood flow of a severe heart failure patient, such as velocity distribution, vorticity, and standard deviation of velocity. In this study, a silicone model of the LV was constructed from the computed tomography data of one patient with heart failure and was 3D printed. Then, intraventricular flow was visualized by particle image velocimetry equipment within a mock circulation loop. The results showed that the axial blood pump suctions most of the blood in a severely failing LV, there was an altered flow status within the LV, and blood stasis appeared in the central region of the LV. Some blood may be suctioned from the aortic valve to the blood pump because the patient's native heart was severely failing. Blood stasis at the LV center may cause thrombosis in the LV. The vortex flow near the inner wall of the LV can thoroughly wash the left ventricular cavity.  
Differentiation of left atrial appendage thrombus from circulatory stasis using cardiac CT radiomics in patients with valvular heart disease.  ;OBJECTIVES: To determine whether quantitative radiomic features from cardiac CT could differentiate the left atrial appendage (LAA) thrombus from circulatory stasis in patients with valvular heart disease. METHODS: Ninety-five consecutive patients with valvular heart disease and filling defects in LAA on two-phase cardiac CT from March 2016 to August 2018 were retrospectively enrolled and classified as having thrombus or stasis by transesophageal echocardiography or cardiac surgery. The ratio of Hounsfield units in the filling defects to those in the ascending aorta (AA) was calculated on early- and late-phase CT (LAA/AAE and LAA/AAL, respectively). Radiomic features were extracted from semi-automated three-dimensional segmentation of the filling defect on early-phase CT. The diagnostic ability of radiomic features for differentiating thrombus from stasis was assessed and compared to LAA/AAE and LAA/AAL by comparing the AUC of ROC curves. Diagnostic performances of CT attenuation ratios and radiomic features were validated with an independent validation set. RESULTS: Thrombus was diagnosed in 25 cases and stasis in 70. Sixty-eight radiomic features were extracted. Values of 8 wavelet-transformed features were lower in thrombus than in stasis (p < 0.001). The AUC value of a radiomic feature, wavelet_LHL, for diagnosing thrombus was 0.78, which was higher than that of LAA/AAE (AUC = 0.54, p = 0.025) and similar to that of LAA/AAL (AUC = 0.76, p = 0.773). In the validation set, the AUC of wavelet_LHL was 0.71, which was higher than that of LAA/AAE (AUC = 0.57, p = 0.391) and similar to that of LAA/AAL (AUC = 0.75, p = 0.707). CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative radiomic features from the early phase of cardiac CT may help diagnose LAA thrombus in patients with valvular heart disease. KEY POINTS: • Wavelet-transformed grey-level non-uniformity values from radiomic analysis are significantly lower for LAA thrombus than for circulatory stasis. • Radiomic features may have an additional value for differentiating LAA thrombus from circulatory stasis when interpreting single-phase cardiac CT. • Radiomic features extracted from single-phase images may show similar diagnostic ability as conventional quantitative analysis from two-phase images.  
Focus on a rare clinical entity: unicuspid aortic valve disease.  ;INTRODUCTION: While the understanding of the pathophysiology and clinical implication of bicuspid aortic valves evolves rapidly, the natural history of unicuspid aortic valves is still poorly understood. Hence, a universally accepted diagnostic work-up process and therapy recommendations for UAV still have to be established. AREAS COVERED: This article aims to give an overview on the most recent literature addressing the pathophysiology, the diagnostic tools and appropriate surgical therapy options of unicuspid aortic valve. Due to the rare prevalence, the understanding of pathophysiology is still missing. Further, symptomatic aortic valve disease are seen much earlier life stage in this cohorts. Thus, it highlights the several surgical treatment options with pro and contra especially for the young adult cohorts. EXPERT OPINION: Large scale prospective observational studies using standardized diagnostic criteria are needed to reveal the clinical course. Further appropriate treatment strategies of unicuspid aortic valve patients is demanded.  
Intrinsic Endocardial Defects Contribute to Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome.  ;Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) is a complex congenital heart disease characterized by abnormalities in the left ventricle, associated valves, and ascending aorta. Studies have shown intrinsic myocardial defects but do not sufficiently explain developmental defects in the endocardial-derived cardiac valve, septum, and vasculature. Here, we identify a developmentally impaired endocardial population in HLHS through single-cell RNA profiling of hiPSC-derived endocardium and human fetal heart tissue with an underdeveloped left ventricle. Intrinsic endocardial defects contribute to abnormal endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition, NOTCH signaling, and extracellular matrix organization, key factors in valve formation. Endocardial abnormalities cause reduced cardiomyocyte proliferation and maturation by disrupting fibronectin-integrin signaling, consistent with recently described de novo HLHS mutations associated with abnormal endocardial gene and fibronectin regulation. Together, these results reveal a critical role for endocardium in HLHS etiology and provide a rationale for considering endocardial function in regenerative strategies.  
Cardiovascular safety of fenfluramine in the treatment of Dravet syndrome: Analysis of an ongoing long-term open-label safety extension study.  ;OBJECTIVE: Fenfluramine, which was previously approved as a weight loss drug, was withdrawn in 1997 when reports of cardiac valvulopathy emerged. The present study was conducted in part to characterize the cardiovascular safety profile of low-dose fenfluramine when used in a pediatric population to reduce seizure frequency in patients with Dravet syndrome. METHODS: Patients 2- to 18-years-old with Dravet syndrome who had completed any of three randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials of fenfluramine were offered enrollment in this open-label extension (OLE) study. All patients were treated with fenfluramine starting at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg/day (oral solution dosed twice per day), which was titrated to maximal effect with a dose limit of 0.7 mg/kg/day (maximum 26 mg/day) or 0.4 mg/kg/day (maximum 17 mg/day) in patients receiving concomitant stiripentol. Standardized echocardiographic examinations were conducted at Week 4 or 6 and then every 3 months during the OLE study to monitor cardiac valve function and structure and pulmonary artery pressure. The primary end point for the echocardiography analysis was the number of patients who developed valvular heart disease or pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH) during treatment. RESULTS: A total of 232 patients were enrolled in the study. The average age of patients was 9.1 ± 4.7 years, and 55.2% were male. The median duration of treatment with fenfluramine was 256 days (range = 58-634 days), and the mean dose of fenfluramine was 0.41 mg/kg/day. No cases of valvular heart disease or PAH were observed. SIGNIFICANCE: Longitudinal echocardiography over a median 8.4 months of treatment with fenfluramine suggests a low risk of developing cardiac valvulopathy and PAH when used to treat pediatric patients with Dravet syndrome.  
Determination of antibiotics and detergent residues in decellularized tissue-engineered heart valves using LC-MS/MS.  ;Residual chemicals that are presented during tissue processing in human tissue banks can be a risk for the allograft recipient. Determine the residual concentrations of the antibiotics and detergent used in the process of human decellularized tissue-engineered heart valves stored in isotonic saline solution up to 18 months. A total of 24 human decellularized allografts were stored in sterile sodium chloride and analyzed immediately after the decellularization process (0 months) and after storage for 6, 12, and 18 months, which includes the use of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and antibiotics (cefoxitin, vancomycin hydrochloride, lincomycin hydrochloride, polymyxin B sulfate). These valves were used for suitability tests, the zone of inhibition evaluation, and direct contact cytotoxicity assay. The stock solution from 32 valves was used for LC-MS/MS analysis of antibiotics and SDS. Tissue samples from decellularized valves showed a zone of inhibition formation for S. aureus and B. subtilis, suggesting the presence of an inhibitory molecule in the tissue. Cytotoxicity tests were negative. Polymyxin B, vancomycin, and SDS were detected and quantified in human decellularized aortic and pulmonary allografts during all periods of the study. There were no traces of residual cefoxitin and lincomycin in the tissue stock solution. We found residual concentrations of the antibiotics and detergent used in the process of human decellularized tissue-engineered heart valves stored in isotonic saline solution up to 18 months.  
Reverse remodeling after percutaneous transluminal septal myocardial ablation in severe but asymptomatic LVOT obstruction (RASTA) study: Rationale and design of transcatheter septal reduction in asymptomatic patients with severe hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy.  ;OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of percutaneous transluminal septal myocardial ablation (PTSMA) on remodeling in asymptomatic patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) and severe left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction. BACKGROUND: Symptoms justify invasive treatment in HOCM patients with LVOT obstruction. Adverse structural and functional changes (remodeling) in the heart occur preceding heart failure and sudden cardiac death. Early invasive treatment in asymptomatic patients may reverse adverse remodeling to the same extent as in symptomatic patients. METHODS: Reverse remodeling after PTSMA in severe but asymptomatic LVOT obstruction (RASTA) study is a prospective single-blind randomized trial (ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT04230551). Ten asymptomatic HOCM patients with an exertional LVOT gradient ≥50 mmHg (or >30 mmHg in rest) are randomized 1:1 to PTSMA versus conservative therapy, in the absence of mitral valve disease or other indications for cardiac surgery. Five symptomatic (reference group) will undergo PTSMA according to the current guidelines. RESULTS: Remodeling is assessed using extensive cardiac imaging with transthoracic echocardiography and late gadolinium enhancement cardiac magnetic resonance at baseline and during follow-up at 1, 12, and 24 months. Extracellular volume fraction, global, and regional strain analysis, geometry, pressure gradients and changes in four-dimensional velocity mapping are primary parameters to study (reversal of) adverse remodeling. CONCLUSIONS: The RASTA study gives insight in cardiac remodeling that may occur in asymptomatic patients after PTSMA. It will provide arguments whether to pursue (or not) a larger trial with clinical endpoints in asymptomatic HOCM patients with severe LVOT obstruction.  
Assessing the risk of stroke development following retinal artery occlusion.  ;BACKGROUND: Retinal artery occlusion (RAO) can cause acute, painless, and irreversible loss of vision. Using a large sample population database, we investigated the possible impact of RAO and numerous other clinical and non-clinical factors on the risk of developing a subsequent cerebrovascular accident. METHODS: Cases of RAO were obtained from the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database between 2002 and 2013 using ICD-9 codes. Associated morbidities and procedures were assessed in these cases with a primary hospital admitting diagnosis of stroke. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were carried out in RAO cases to determine risk factors for stroke. The Bonferroni correction method was applied. RESULTS: The RAO group consisted of 19,809 cases that were separated into stroke (n=1,157, 55% male, mean age: 69±0.4 years) and non-stroke (n=18,652, 55% male, mean age: 68±0.1) cohorts. Age groups associated with reduced risk of stroke with respect to were 20-39 (OR: 0.391), 40-59 (OR: 0.842), and 60-79 (OR: 0.837). No cases of stroke were present for ages < 20. Other factors associated with a reduced stroke risk were carotid stenosis (OR: 0.187), transient ischemic attack (OR: 0.064), coronary artery disease (OR: 0.788), cardiac catheterization (OR: 0.481), and septicemia (OR: 0.333). Factors associated with an increased risk of stroke included hypertension (OR: 1.418), tobacco use (OR: 1.568), valvular disease (OR: 1.359), hyperlipidemia (OR: 1.298), and non-stroke cerebrovascular disease (OR: 2.985). CONCLUSIONS: A large patient population was used to determine that RAO patients with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, tobacco usage, valvular disease, or non-stroke cerebrovascular disease had an increased risk of stroke. Patients below the age of 40 had significantly reduced the odds of stroke. Carotid stenosis, coronary artery disease, transient ischemic attacks, cardiac catheterization, and septicemia were all independently associated with a decreased risk of stroke development in RAO patients.  
How pulmonary valve regurgitation after tetralogy of fallot repair changes the flow dynamics in the right ventricle: An in vitro study.  ;Tetralogy of Fallot is the most common cyanotic congenital disease, affecting 10% of children with congenital heart disease. The surgical management of patients with Tetralogy of Fallot leads, however, to significant detrimental effects on the right ventricle including pulmonary valve regurgitation. This experiment aimed to simulate different cases of pulmonary valve regurgitation with varying degrees of severity in order to observe the changes in flow structures present in the right ventricle. Planar time-resolved particle image velocimetry measurements have been performed on a custom-made double activation simulator reproducing flow conditions in a model of a right ventricle. Changes in flow characteristics in the right ventricle have been evaluated in terms of velocity fields and profiles, tricuspid inflow jet orientation and viscous energy dissipation. Our results show that pulmonary valve regurgitation significantly alters the flow in the right ventricle mostly by impairing the diastolic inflow through the tricuspid valve and by increasing viscous energy loss. This fundamental work should allow for a better understanding of such changes in the RV flow dynamics. It may also help in developing new strategies allowing for a better follow-up of patients with repaired TOF and for decision-making in terms of pulmonary valve replacement.  
The prescribing of antibiotics for endodontic infections by dentists in Turkey: a comprehensive survey.  ;AIM: To investigate the antibiotic prescribing patterns for endodontic infections based on the reports of Turkish dentists. METHODOLOGY: A survey consisting of 20 questions on general information and 13 questions on antibiotic prescribing patterns for endodontic cases was delivered to the e-mail addresses of general dentists and specialists via the database of the Turkish Dental Association. Collected data were analysed using Mc-Nemar-Bowker Test and multivariate ordinal logistic regression tests at the significance level of 0.05. RESULTS: A total of 1007 responses were obtained from 17 827 dentists. The majority of the participants were general dental practitioners (GDP, 80%) whilst 8% were Endodontists. Gender, clinical experience, affiliations and speciality were significant risk factors for antibiotic prescription (P < 0.05). GDPs prescribed antibiotics twice as much as all specialists and members of public hospitals prescribed antibiotics three times more than specialists and clinical academics (P < 0.05). Amoxicillin with clavulanic acid was the most prescribed antibiotic (90%), followed by Ornidazole (25%). Clindamycin was the drug of choice for the patients with penicillin allergy (59%). Infection and fever control (76%), prophylaxis (44%) and avoiding swelling and trismus during endodontic treatment (26%) were the most common reasons for antibiotic prescriptions. Completing a course of prescribed antibiotics was recommended by most (75%). Infective endocarditis, immunosuppression, artificial heart valve and mitral valve prolapse were the main causes of prophylaxis in descending order. Uncontrolled and extensive use of antibiotics by patients (62%) was mentioned as the most effective reason for antibiotic resistance. Up to 10% of participants prescribed antibiotics for symptomatic irreversible pulpitis, asymptomatic apical periodontitis with or without endodontic treatment (8, 12 and 11%, respectively). Up to 20% of dentists prescribed antibiotics for symptomatic apical periodontitis when the pulp was vital or necrotic (13 and 23%, respectively). Almost one third of the participants prescribed antibiotics for symptomatic apical periodontitis of previously treated teeth with or without radiographic lesions whilst 34% prescribed antibiotics for acute apical abscess with localized swelling without systemic involvement. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of dentists reported they prescribed antibiotics inappropriately. It is necessary to improve the knowledge of dentists about antibiotics and their indications in endodontics.  
Right Ventricle Has Normal Myofilament Function But Shows Perturbations in the Expression of Extracellular Matrix Genes in Patients With Tetralogy of Fallot Undergoing Pulmonary Valve Replacement.  ;Background Patients with repair of tetralogy of Fallot (rToF) who are approaching adulthood often exhibit pulmonary valve regurgitation, leading to right ventricle (RV) dilatation and dysfunction. The regurgitation can be corrected by pulmonary valve replacement (PVR), but the optimal surgical timing remains under debate, mainly because of the poorly understood nature of RV remodeling in patients with rToF. The goal of this study was to probe for pathologic molecular, cellular, and tissue changes in the myocardium of patients with rToF at the time of PVR. Methods and Results We measured contractile function of permeabilized myocytes, collagen content of tissue samples, and the expression of mRNA and selected proteins in RV tissue samples from patients with rToF undergoing PVR for severe pulmonary valve regurgitation. The data were compared with nondiseased RV tissue from unused donor hearts. Contractile performance and passive stiffness of the myofilaments in permeabilized myocytes were similar in rToF-PVR and RV donor samples, as was collagen content and cross-linking. The patients with rToF undergoing PVR had enhanced mRNA expression of genes associated with connective tissue diseases and tissue remodeling, including the small leucine-rich proteoglycans ASPN (asporin), LUM (lumican), and OGN (osteoglycin), although their protein levels were not significantly increased. Conclusions RV myofilaments from patients with rToF undergoing PVR showed no functional impairment, but the changes in extracellular matrix gene expression may indicate the early stages of remodeling. Our study found no evidence of major damage at the cellular and tissue levels in the RV of patients with rToF who underwent PVR according to current clinical criteria.  
Patient-Specific Bicuspid Aortic Valve Biomechanics: A Magnetic Resonance Imaging Integrated Fluid-Structure Interaction Approach.  ;"Congenital bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) consists of two fused cusps and represents a major risk factor for calcific valvular stenosis. Herein, a fully coupled fluid-structure interaction (FSI) BAV model was developed from patient-specific magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and compared against in vivo 4-dimensional flow MRI (4D Flow). FSI simulation compared well with 4D Flow, confirming direction and magnitude of the flow jet impinging onto the aortic wall as well as location and extension of secondary flows and vortices developing at systole: the systolic flow jet originating from an elliptical 1.6 cm2 orifice reached a peak velocity of 252.2 cm/s, 0.6% lower than 4D Flow, progressively impinging on the ascending aorta convexity. The FSI model predicted a peak flow rate of 22.4 L/min, 6.7% higher than 4D Flow, and provided BAV leaflets mechanical and flow-induced shear stresses, not directly attainable from MRI. At systole, the ventricular side of the non-fused leaflet revealed the highest wall shear stress (WSS) average magnitude, up to 14.6 Pa along the free margin, with WSS progressively decreasing towards the belly. During diastole, the aortic side of the fused leaflet exhibited the highest diastolic maximum principal stress, up to 322 kPa within the attachment region. Systematic comparison with ground-truth non-invasive MRI can improve the computational model ability to reproduce native BAV hemodynamics and biomechanical response more realistically, and shed light on their role in BAV patients' risk for developing complications; this approach may further contribute to the validation of advanced FSI simulations designed to assess BAV biomechanics.

T1 mapping and cardiac magnetic resonance feature tracking in mitral valve prolapse.  ;"OBJECTIVES: T1 mapping (T1-map) and cardiac magnetic resonance feature tracking (CMR-FT) techniques have been introduced for the early detection of interstitial myocardial fibrosis and deformation abnormalities. We sought to demonstrate that T1-map and CMR-FT may identify the presence of subclinical myocardial structural changes in patients with mitral valve prolapse (MVP). METHODS: Consecutive MVP patients with moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation and comparative matched healthy subjects were prospectively enrolled and underwent CMR-FT analysis to calculate 2D global and segmental circumferential (CS) and radial strain (RS) and T1-map to determine global and segmental native T1 (nT1) values. RESULTS: Seventy-three MVP patients (mean age, 57 ± 13 years old; male, 76%; regurgitant volume, 57 ± 21 mL) and 42 matched control subjects (mean age, 56 ± 18 years; male, 74%) were included. MVP patients showed a lower global CS (- 16.3 ± 3.4% vs. - 17.8 ± 1.9%, p = 0.020) and longer global nT1 (1124.9 ± 97.7 ms vs. 1007.4 ± 26.1 ms, p < 0.001) as compared to controls. Moreover, MVP patients showed lower RS and CS in basal (21.6 ± 12.3% vs. 27.6 ± 8.9%, p = 0.008, and - 13.0 ± 6.7% vs. - 14.9 ± 4.1%, p = 0.013) and mid-inferolateral (20.6 ± 10.7% vs. 28.4 ± 8.7%, p < 0.001, and - 12.8 ± 6.3% vs. - 16.5 ± 4.0%, p < 0.001) walls as compared to other myocardial segments. Similarly, MVP patients showed longer nT1 values in basal (1080 ± 68 ms vs. 1043 ± 43 ms, p < 0.001) and mid-inferolateral (1080 ± 77 ms vs. 1034 ± 37 ms, p < 0.001) walls as compared to other myocardial segments. Of note, nT1 values were significantly correlated with CS (r, 0.36; p < 0.001) and RS (r, 0.37; p < 0.001) but not with regurgitant volume. CONCLUSIONS: T1-map and CMR-FT identify subclinical left ventricle tissue changes in patients with MVP. Further studies are required to correlate these subclinical tissue changes with the outcome. KEY POINTS: • T1 mapping (T1-map) and cardiac magnetic resonance feature tracking (CMR-FT) techniques have been introduced for the early detection of interstitial myocardial fibrosis and deformation abnormalities. • In MVP patients, we demonstrated a longer global nT1 with associated reduced global circumferential (CS) and radial strain (RS) as compared to control subjects. • Among MVP patients, the mid-basal left ventricle inferolateral wall showed longer nT1 with reduced CS and RS as compared to other myocardial segments. Further studies are required to correlate these subclinical tissue changes with the outcome.  "
Paravalvular Abscess as a Complication of Streptococcus Salivarius Infective Endocarditis of a Bioprosthetic Aortic Valve.  ;Rates of implantation of prosthetic valves and cardiac devices have increased significantly in the last thirty years, accounting, at least in-part, for the growing incidence of infective endocarditis cases. Prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) is an endovascular, microbial infection occurring on parts of a valve prosthesis or on reconstructed native heart valves. We present a case of a 63-year-old man with multiple comorbidities including extensive cardiovascular disease, who recently underwent bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement. Patient presented to the emergency department with exertional chest pain, dyspnea, fever, melena and lethargy. Blood cultures grew Streptococcus salivarius and transesophageal echocardiography confirmed PVE with an aortic paravalvular abscess. The patient was treated with appropriate antimicrobial therapy based on culture sensitivity and subsequently referred to cardiothoracic surgery for urgent evaluation. This case highlights several important points which include but are not limited to: investigation into the pathogen Streptococcus salivarius and its relationship to other known pathogens, understanding of the complications associated with PVE, and the importance of early identification of PVE and initiation of medical and surgical therapy with respect to prognosis.  
Comparison of outcomes following isolated repair of tricuspid versus bicuspid aortic valves.  ;BACKGROUND: Aortic valve repair (AV-repair) is an alternative treatment option for patients with aortic regurgitation (AR), but durability is still reason for concern, especially for bicuspid aortic valves (BAV). We retrospectively evaluated mid-term results after AV-repair in patients with BAV or tricuspid aortic valves (TAV), including reoperation rates, recurrence of regurgitation, and survival. METHODS: Patients undergoing AV-repair between November 2004 and March 2016 without procedures involving the aortic root were included. Echocardiographic examinations were performed before and after the operation and at follow-up. Repair techniques were recorded and evaluated. RESULTS: Of 150 patients, 89 (59.3%) had TAV and 61 (40.7%) BAV. AR ≥ moderate was found in 66 patients with TAV (74.2%) and 49 with BAV (80.3%). At discharge, 74 TAV-patients had ≤ mild AR (84.4%), 11 (12.4%) moderate. 57 patients (93.4%) with BAV had ≤ mild AR, 1 (1.6%) moderate and 2 (3.3%) severe. Mean follow-up was 4.4±2.7 years with ≤ mild AR in 56 TAV patients (73.7%) and moderate in 18 (20.2%). In patients with BAV, 43 (76.8%) had ≤ mild AR and 4 (6.6%) moderate. Survival in patients with TAV was significantly decreased compared to BAV (P=0.033), but reoperation-rates did not differ significantly (P=0.651). CONCLUSIONS: AV-repair is a safe and feasible option in patients with AR and can achieve similar results in patients with TAV and BAV. The complexity of the repair technique predicts repair failure.  
Disturbed nitric oxide signalling gives rise to congenital bicuspid aortic valve and aortopathy.  ;Patients with a congenital bicuspid aortic valve (BAV), a valve with two instead of three aortic leaflets, have an increased risk of developing thoracic aneurysms and aortic dissection. The mechanisms underlying BAV-associated aortopathy are poorly understood. This study examined BAV-associated aortopathy in Nos3-/- mice, a model with congenital BAV formation. A combination of histological examination and in vivo ultrasound imaging was used to investigate aortic dilation and dissections in Nos3-/- mice. Moreover, cell lineage analysis and single-cell RNA sequencing were used to observe the molecular anomalies within vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) of Nos3-/- mice. Spontaneous aortic dissections were found in ascending aortas located at the sinotubular junction in ∼13% of Nos3-/- mice. Moreover, Nos3-/- mice were prone to developing aortic dilations in the proximal and distal ascending aorta during early adulthood. Lower volumes of elastic fibres were found within vessel walls of the ascending aortas of Nos3-/- mice, as well as incomplete coverage of the aortic inner media by neural crest cell (NCC)-derived VSMCs. VSMCs of Nos3-/- mice showed downregulation of 15 genes, of which seven were associated with aortic aneurysms and dissections in the human population. Elastin mRNA was most markedly downregulated, followed by fibulin-5 expression, both primary components of elastic fibres. This study demonstrates that, in addition to congenital BAV formation, disrupted endothelial-mediated nitric oxide (NO) signalling in Nos3-/- mice also causes aortic dilation and dissection, as a consequence of inhibited elastic fibre formation in VSMCs within the ascending aorta.  
A Tale of Two Valves: Bioprosthetic Aortic Valve Obstruction in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus and Antiphospholipid Antibody Syndrome.  ;"Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APLAS) are at risk for cardiac manifestations, specifically valvular heart disease requiring valve replacement. Bioprosthetic valve endocarditis is an important cause of valve failure, and it is important to keep a wide differential, especially in patients with preexisting SLE and APLAS. In this E-challenge, 2 cases of bioprosthetic aortic valve endocarditis are presented; 1 case describes infective bacterial endocarditis on an aortic prosthesis and the second describes a patient with SLE and APLAS who developed bioprosthetic valve obstruction secondary to vegetations, consistent with nonbacterial endocarditis and thrombus. Etiologies for bioprosthetic valve obstruction and evaluation by echocardiography are explored. The comparison between these 2 cases specifically highlights the importance of keeping a wide differential in endocarditis, prosthetic valve vegetations, and bioprosthetic valve obstruction.  "
Management and Outcomes of Transvenous Pacing Leads in Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Tricuspid Valve Replacement.  ;OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of pacemaker lead-related complications following transcatheter tricuspid valve replacement (TTVR). BACKGROUND: The rate of permanent pacemaker implantation following tricuspid valve (TV) surgery is high, and many patients have transvenous leads. The feasibility, safety, and outcomes of subsequently performing TTVR in the setting of transvenous pacemaker leads have not been established. METHODS: The VIVID (Valve-in-Valve International Database) registry was used to review 329 patients who underwent TTVR following TV repair or replacement. Patients were subdivided into 3 cohorts for intergroup comparisons: no lead, epicardial lead, and transvenous lead (entrapped or not entrapped during the TTVR procedure). RESULTS: Of 329 patients who underwent TTVR, 128 (39%) had prior pacing systems in place, 70 with epicardial and 58 with transvenous leads. A total of 31 patients had leads passing through the TV. Three patients had the right ventricular (RV) lead extracted prior to TTVR. The remaining 28 patients had the RV lead entrapped between the transcatheter TV implant and the surgical valve (n = 22) or the repaired TV (n = 6). One patient had displacement of the RV lead during the procedure, and 2 experienced lead failure during follow-up. Overall, there was no significant difference in the cumulative incidences of competing outcomes (death, TV reintervention, TV dysfunction) between patients with and those without pacing leads or entrapped RV leads. CONCLUSIONS: TTVR in the setting of trans-TV pacemaker leads without lead extraction or re-replacement can be performed safely with a low risk for complications, offering an alternative to surgical TV replacement.

Association of myocardial and serum miRNA expression patterns with the presence and extent of coronary artery disease: A cross-sectional study.  ;"BACKGROUND: MicroRNA (miRNAs) participate in the pathogenesis of coronary artery disease (CAD). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the expressions of myocardial and serum miRNA-27а, miRNA-133а, and miRNA-203 in CAD patients. METHOD: This cross-sectional observational study comprised 100 subjects (60.9 ± 1.0 years; 67% men). The right atrial and serum expressions of miRNA-27a, miRNA -133a, and miRNA-203 in 80 patients referred for elective coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) and 20 control patients scheduled for heart valve surgery were analyzed using real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: There was a positive correlation between the SYNTAX score I index and serum miRNA-203 expression level (r = 0.693; p < .001). Patients with ≥3 coronary artery lesions had significantly higher myocardial expressions of miRNA-27a, miRNA-133а, and miRNA-203 than patients with 1-2 vessel disease in the atrial myocardium (miRNA-27a: 234.62 ± 29.51 vs. 182.39 ± 19.62 relative expression unit (REU); miRNA-133а: 127.53 ± 13.41 vs. 111.35 ± 12.31 REU; and miRNA-203: 5.25 ± 0.96 vs. 4.71 ± 0.67 REU; р < 0.05); the same association was found for serum miRNA expressions (miRNA-27a: 11.41 ± 3.85 vs. 4.82 ± 1.82 REU; miRNA-133а: 8.42 ± 2.43 vs. 4.35 ± 1.23 REU; and miRNA-203: 145.71 ± 15.73 vs. 43.70 ± 9.67 REU; р < 0.05). The decision tree method established that the risk of multivessel lesions was increased five-fold if the miRNA-203 serum expression was >101.00 REU (OR, 5.90; 95% CI, 2.34-9.46; p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Both myocardial and serum miRNA-27а, miRNA-133а, and miRNA-203 expressions are higher in CABG patients than in non-CAD subjects. The serum miRNA-203 expression level corresponds to myocardial expression and is strongly correlated with the extent of coronary atherosclerosis.  "
Contemporary Surgical and Transcatheter Management of Mitral Annular Calcification.  ;"BACKGROUND: The presence of mitral annular calcification (MAC) in those with mitral valve (MV) stenosis or regurgitation (MR) is a difficult scenario for surgeons and the Heart Team. Patients with MAC most often have a significant number of co-morbidities that exclude them as surgical candidates. This review highlights the various contemporary techniques available to manage MAC during treatment of the mitral valve. METHODS: We performed a focused review of the anatomy, pathology, and management of MAC. The review describes the surgical and transcatheter techniques with outcomes, where available. RESULTS: The incidence of MAC is between 5-42% in those with severe MV disease. The pathophysiology underlying MAC is not yet clear, but most likely is related to processes of inflammation and atherosclerosis. Surgical techniques can be grouped into those when the MAC is completely resected en bloc or when the MAC is incompletely resected or left in situ. Transcatheter therapies are feasible in some patients, but have been limited by the anatomical constraints of MAC; most importantly left ventricular outflow tract obstruction and paravalvular regurgitation. CONCLUSIONS: Surgeons as part of the Heart Team now have a range of techniques to manage MAC in those patients with severe MV disease. Transcatheter therapies may increase the options for those too high-risk for surgery.  "
Mitral annular calcification in the elderly - Quantitative assessment.  ;"PURPOSE: To determine the reliability of subjective and objective quantification of mitral annular calcification (MAC) in elderly patients with severe aortic stenosis, to define quantitative sex- and age-related reference values of MAC, and to correlate quantitative MAC with mitral valve disease. METHODS: In this retrospective, IRB-approved study, we included 559 patients (268 females, median age 81 years, inter-quartile range 77-85 years) with severe aortic stenosis undergoing CT. Four independent readers performed subjective MAC categorization as follows: no, mild, moderate, and severe MAC. Two independent readers performed quantitative evaluation of MAC using the Agatston score method (AgatstonMAC). Mitral valve disease was determined by echocardiography. RESULTS: Subjective MAC categorization showed high inter-reader agreement for no (k = 0.88) and severe MAC (k = 0.75), whereas agreement for moderate (k = 0.59) and mild (k = 0.45) MAC was moderate. Intra-reader agreement for subjective MAC categorization was substantial (k = 0.69 and 0.62). Inter- and intra-reader agreement for AgatstonMAC were excellent (ICC = 0.998 and 0.999, respectively), with minor inconsistencies in MAC involving the left ventricular outflow tract/aortic valve. There were significantly more women than men with MAC (n = 227, 85% versus n = 209, 72%; p < 0.001), with a significantly higher AgatstonMAC (median 597, range 81-2055 versus median 244; range 0-1565; p < 0.001), particularly in patients ≥85 years of age. AgatstonMAC showed an area-under-the-curve of 0.84 to diagnose mitral stenosis, whereas there was no association of AgatstonMAC with mitral regurgitation (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our study in elderly patients with severe aortic stenosis shows that quantitative MAC scoring is more reliable than subjective MAC assessment. Women show higher AgatstonMAC scores than men, particularly in the elderly population. AgatstonMAC shows high accuracy to diagnose mitral stenosis.  "
Late Adverse Cardiorenal Events of Catheter Procedure-Related Acute Kidney Injury After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.  ;"Data regarding the longitudinal effect of catheter procedure-related acute kidney injury (AKI) on clinical outcomes are limited. This study aimed to assess the late adverse cardiorenal events of AKI following transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). A total of 2,518 patients who underwent TAVI, excluding in-hospital deaths, were enrolled from the Japanese multicenter registry. The definition of AKI was determined using the Valve Academic Research Consortium-2 criteria. The incidence, predictors, major adverse renal and cardiac events (MARCE), and all-cause mortality of AKI were evaluated. MARCE included readmission for renal and heart failure (HF), hemodialysis requirement, and cardiovascular-renal death during the follow-up period. The incidence of AKI was 9.7% in the entire cohort. The significant predictive factors of AKI were men, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, low albumin, overdose of contrast media, nontransfemoral approach, transfusion, vascular complications, and new pacemaker implantation. The rates of HF readmission and future hemodialysis were significantly higher in patients with AKI than in those without AKI (19.7% vs 9.0%, p <0.001, 3.3% vs 0.4%, p <0.001, respectively). Cox regression multivariate analysis showed that AKI occurrence was an independent predictive factor for the incremental risk of both MARCE and late mortality up to 4 years (hazard ratio [HR] 1.59, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.75 to 1.20, p <0.001, HR 2.18, 95% CI 1.70 to 2.79; p <0.001, respectively). In conclusion, AKI occurrence was significantly associated with late adverse cardiorenal events after TAVI. Adequate clinical management can be expected to reduce AKI-related late phase cardiorenal damage even after successful TAVI.  "
Dual Antiplatelet Therapy After Percutaneous Coronary Intervention and Drug-Eluting Stents: A Systematic Review and Network Meta-Analysis.  ;"BACKGROUND: The optimal duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after percutaneous coronary intervention with drug-eluting stents remains uncertain. We compared short-term (<6-month) DAPT followed by aspirin or P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy; midterm (6-month) DAPT; 12-month DAPT; and extended-term (>12-month) DAPT after percutaneous coronary intervention with drug-eluting stents. METHODS: Twenty-four randomized, controlled trials were selected using Medline, Embase, Cochrane library, and online databases through September 2019. The coprimary end points were myocardial infarction and major bleeding, which constituted the net clinical benefit. A frequentist network meta-analysis was conducted with a random-effects model. RESULTS: In 79 073 patients, at a median follow-up of 18 months, extended-term DAPT was associated with a reduced risk of myocardial infarction in comparison with 12-month DAPT (absolute risk difference, -3.8 incident cases per 1000 person-years; relative risk, 0.68 [95% CI, 0.54-0.87]), midterm DAPT (absolute risk difference, -4.6 incident cases per 1000 person-years; relative risk, 0.61 [0.45-0.83]), and short-term DAPT followed by aspirin monotherapy (absolute risk difference, -6.1 incident cases per 1000 person-years; relative risk, 0.55 [0.37-0.83]), or P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy (absolute risk difference, -3.7 incident cases per 1000 person-years; relative risk, 0.69 [0.51-0.95]). Conversely, extended-term DAPT was associated with a higher risk of major bleeding than all other DAPT groups. In comparison with 12-month DAPT, no significant differences in the risks of ischemic end points or major bleeding were observed with midterm or short-term DAPT followed by aspirin monotherapy, with the exception that short-term DAPT followed by P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy was associated with a reduced risk of major bleeding. There were no significant differences with respect to mortality between the different DAPT strategies. In acute coronary syndrome, extended-term in comparison with 12-month DAPT was associated with a reduced risk of myocardial infarction without a significant increase in the risk of major bleeding. CONCLUSIONS: The present network meta-analysis suggests that, in comparison with 12-month DAPT, short-term DAPT followed by P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy reduces major bleeding after percutaneous coronary intervention with drug-eluting stents, whereas extended-term DAPT reduces myocardial infarction at the expense of more bleeding events.

Obstructive shock caused by right atrial thrombosis secondary to malignant pheochromocytoma in a dog.  ;BACKGROUND: Obstructive shock can be caused by any lesion leading to extraluminal compression or intraluminal occlusion of the cardiac chambers or major vessels. CASE REPORT: A 12-year-old, male castrated, Border Collie cross dog presented to a veterinary teaching hospital for collapse. A physical examination revealed severe vasoconstrictive shock and abdominal distension. Abnormalities on blood tests were consistent with systemic hypoperfusion. Cardiac underfilling, hepatomegaly with distended vasculature and ascites were identified by focused ultrasonography, raising suspicion of obstructive shock. This was supported by the radiographic findings of microcardia and a distended caudal vena cava (CVC). There was transient response to fluid therapy for blood volume expansion. Repeat focused ultrasonography during rapid intravenous fluid administration identified a right intra-atrial mass, assessed as likely to be causing obstruction of venous return. The dog was humanely euthanased given the guarded prognosis. At postmortem evaluation, a malignant pheochromocytoma in the left adrenal gland with tumour thrombus extending to the tricuspid valve through the CVC was found. The extensive thrombus caused the obstructive shock in this case. Metastasis in a peripheral lymph node and neoplastic emboli in the heart and lungs were also visible at the histopathological evaluation. CONCLUSION: To the best of authors' knowledge, this is the first report of severe obstructive shock secondary to extension of caval tumour thrombus into the right atrium in a dog with malignant pheochromocytoma. Tumour thrombus from a malignant pheochromocytoma should be included as a differential diagnosis of obstructive shock, with or without a visible right intra-atrial mass, in dogs. Serial focused ultrasonography during intravenous fluid administration can aid diagnosis.  
Lipid mass spectrometry imaging and proteomic analysis of severe aortic stenosis.  ;Severe aortic stenosis (AS) is prevalent in adults ≥ 65 years, a significant cause of morbidity and mortality, with no medical therapy. Lipid and proteomic alterations of human AS tissue were determined using mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) and liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) to understand histopathology, potential biomarkers of disease, and progression from non-calcified to calcified phenotype. A reproducible MSI method was developed using healthy murine aortic valves (n = 3) and subsequently applied to human AS (n = 2). Relative lipid levels were spatially mapped and associated with different microdomains. Proteomics for non-calcified and calcified microdomains were performed to ascertain differences in expression. Increased pro-osteogenic and inflammatory lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) 16:0 and 18:0 were co-localized with calcified microdomains. Proteomics analysis identified differential patterns in calcified microdomains with high LPC and low cholesterol as compared to non-calcified microdomains with low LPC and high cholesterol. Calcified microdomains had higher levels of: apolipoproteins (Apo) B-100 (p < 0.001) and Apo A-IV (p < 0.001), complement C3 and C4-B (p < 0.001), C5 (p = 0.007), C8 beta chain (p = 0.013) and C9 (p = 0.010), antithrombotic proteins alpha-2-macroglobulin (p < 0.0001) and antithrombin III (p = 0.002), and higher anti-calcific fetuin-A (p = 0.02), while the osteoblast differentiating factor transgelin (p < 0.0001), extracellular matrix proteins versican, prolargin, and lumican ( p < 0.001) and regulator protein complement factor H (p < 0.001) were higher in non-calcified microdomains. A combined lipidomic and proteomic approach provided insight into factors potentially contributing to progression from non-calcified to calcific disease in severe AS. Additional studies of these candidates and protein networks could yield new targets for slowing progression of AS.  
Impact of arterio-ventricular interaction on first-phase ejection fraction in aortic stenosis.  ;AIMS : First-phase ejection fraction (EF1), the EF at the time to peak aortic jet velocity, has been proposed as a novel marker of peak systolic function in aortic stenosis (AS). This study aimed to explore the association of myocardial contractility and arterial load with EF1 in AS patients. METHODS AND RESULTS : Data from a prospective, cross-sectional study of 114 patients with mild, moderate, and severe AS with preserved left ventricular EF (>50%) were analysed. EF1 was measured as the volume change from end-diastole to the time that corresponded to peak aortic jet velocity. Myocardial contractility was assessed by strain rate measured by speckle tracking echocardiography. Arterial stiffness was assessed by central pulse pressure/stroke volume index ratio (PP/SVi). The total study population included 48% women, median age was 73 years, and mean peak aortic jet velocity was 3.47 m/s. In univariable linear regression analyses, lower EF1 was associated with higher age, higher peak aortic jet velocity, lower global EF, lower global longitudinal strain, lower strain rate, and higher PP/SVi. There was no significant association between EF1 and heart rate or sex. In multivariable linear regression analysis, EF1 was associated with lower strain rate and higher PP/SVi, independent of AS severity. Replacing PP/SVi by valvular impedance did not change the results. CONCLUSION : In patients with AS, reduced myocardial contractility and increased arterial load were associated with lower EF1 independent of the severity of valve stenosis.  
Fluid-structure interaction of blood flow around a vein valve.  ;Introduction: Venous valves are a type of one-way valves which conduct blood flow toward the heart and prevent its backflow. Any malfunction of these organs may cause serious problems in the circulatory system. Numerical simulation can give us detailed information and point to point data such as velocity, wall shear stress, and von Mises stress from veins with small diameters, as obtaining such data is almost impossible using current medical devices. Having detailed information about fluid flow and valves' function can help the treatment of the related diseases. Methods: In the present work, the blood flow through a venous valve considering the flexibility of the vein wall and valve leaflets is investigated numerically. The governing equations of fluid flow and solid domain are discretized and solved by the Galerkin finite element method. Results: The obtained results showed that the blood velocity increases from inlet to the leaflets and then decreases passing behind the valve. A pair of vortices and the trapped region was observed just behind the valves. These regions have low shear stresses and are capable of sediment formation. Conclusion: The von Mises stress which is a criterion for the breakdown of solid materials was obtained. It was also observed that a maximum value occurred at the bottom of the leaflets.  
Rajput FA(1), Zeltser R(2).  ;"The aortic valve is a semilunar valve with three leaflets, which lies at the junction of left ventricle and aorta. It allows unidirectional blood flow from the left ventricle to the aorta and the rest of the body. Because of the highly complex and sophisticated cellular and molecular functions, the thin valve leaflet can withstand extreme mechanical and hemodynamic forces with every cardiac cycle. Various factors including age and congenital defects can compromise the normal valvular function leading to a wide variety of complications. Although bicuspid aortic valves (BAV) are the most common congenital abnormality, congenital valve defects can range from aortic atresia (missing or incomplete closure of aortic valves) to a sub or supra-valvular stenosis. BAV is reported to have an incidence of 1 to 2% with a male predominance. Lack of microfibrillar proteins during valvulogenesis has been reported to affect the leaflet development where two leaflets are fused to form one large leaflet. It frequently correlates with aortic abnormalities such as aortic dilation (root, ascending and arch) and coarctation of the aorta. The bicuspid aortic valve leaflets can undergo accelerated calcific degeneration because of abnormal hemodynamic forces. Congenital abnormalities including BAV can lead to various valvular complications including aortic stenosis and aortic regurgitation leading to an increased risk to infective endocarditis, which has a reported incidence of 12 to 39% in BAV. Unless severe, BAV generally remains asymptomatic till the age of 50 to 60 years. Aortic stenosis (AS) is a narrowing of the valve aperture reducing the aortic valve area. Increased resistance to blood flow and transvalvular pressure gradient causes increased left ventricle workload causing hypertrophy. Its prevalence increases with age and can be as high as 4.6% in people greater than age 75 years. Being the most common valvular disease in Europe and America, estimates are that 3.5 million people in England alone will have AS by the year 2020. Calcific degeneration leading to stiffening and restriction motion of valve leaflet is the most common cause of AS. Disruption of endothelium lining on the aortic side caused by increased mechanical stress seem to be the inciting event. Posterior leaflets are reported to be affected the most. Rheumatic fever causing inflammation of the leaflets is still the leading cause of AS in developing countries. AS can be asymptomatic or can cause symptoms of syncope, angina and heart failure. Severe AS is fatal with a 50% mortality at 2 years. As per The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines, AS is graded severe when the orifice area is less than 1.0 cm, the mean gradient is greater than 40 mmHg or the jet velocity is greater than 4 m/s. Prognosis is poor in symptomatic or severe cases unless the valve is replaced. Up to 30% of patients aged > 75 do not undergo surgical valve replacement either because of technical reasons; this may include porcelain aorta, general frailty, refusal to undergo surgery, and serious comorbid conditions. The operative death risk for surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) is as high as 10% in patients with LV dysfunction, chronic renal disease, and advanced age. Trans-catheter aortic valve replacement and trans-catheter aortic valve implantation (TAVR/TAVI) have emerged as a more feasible and less risky option for patients not suitable for surgery. Aortic regurgitation (AR) is the backflow of blood from the aorta to the left ventricle when the valve leaflets fail to coapt. Common causes include congenital defects, calcific degeneration, infective endocarditis, rheumatic fever, and trauma. Ventricular hypertrophy in chronic cases accommodates increased volume to maintain the normal stroke volume and end-diastolic pressure; hence, chronic AR can be asymptomatic for decades. In contrast, with acute cases of AR, ventricles do not have enough time to undergo the needed changes such as hypertrophy to accommodate increased volumes. Because of decreased stroke volume, the heart rate increases to maintain cardiac output but is insufficient to meet the demand resulting in increased left atrial pressure, pulmonary edema and cardiogenic shock. On physical examination, AR murmur is blowing, high-pitched, diastolic, and decrescendo, beginning soon after the aortic component of S (A); it is loudest at the 3rd or 4th left parasternal intercostal space. It also has associations with various other murmurs including: “Mid-systolic murmur” because of rapid ejection of an overload of blood from the left ventricle, “Austin Flint” murmur is mid-to-late diastolic murmur due to partial closure of mitral valve during ventricular systole because of regurgitant flow from aortic valve, “Cole-Cecil” is a diastolic murmur due to the fusion of an aortic murmur with the S3 because of simultaneous filling of the left ventricle from left atrium and AR. History of Valvular Surgery Dr. Theodore Tuffier, in 1912, used his finger to free the fused leaflets of a stenosed aortic valve. Before the advent of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), mitral valve repair involved commissurotomy through access from the left atrial chamber. Thomas Homes Sellors performed first pulmonary valvulotomy in 1948 by using a tenotomy knife. Charles Hufnagel developed the first artificial valve based on a reciprocating ball and cage. It was used to prevent backflow of blood into the ventricles due to aortic insufficiency. CPB machine revolutionized the valve replacement in the anatomical position. Dr. Dwight Harken and his colleagues performed the first successful aortic valve replacement. Later that year, Drs. Albert Starr and Lowell Edwards performed mitral valve replacement. Bioprosthetic valves are closer in function to natural valves but have a limited life expectancy, whereas, Mechanical valves are more durable but require anticoagulation. The choice of valves, among other factors, depends upon the patient’s age and well-being. Mechanical heart valves are known to last for approximately 25 years. Seventy different mechanical heart valves have been developed since 1960. Ball and cage, bi-leaflet, and tilting disc are the common ones. Modification of the ball valve by Dr. Albert Starr and Lowell Edwards entailed developing a cage made of lucite with a silicone elastomer ball. The cage material was later changed to stainless steel and then cobalt-chromium alloys. The Starr-Edward valve also has a Teflon sewing ring, which enabled suturing into mitral and later into the aortic position. Increased thrombogenicity has been a significant issue, for which valves underwent several modifications such as measures to reduce metal contact by covering the struts with cloth and using Silastic shields. Other issues included hemolysis due to excessive rubbing of the ball against the sewing ring and occlusion of coronary ostia because of high profile. Despite these issues, these valves showed the feasibility of prosthetic valve enabling Starr-Edwards to draw design criteria. Basic points included that the valves should be chemically inert, biocompatible, a-traumatic to blood, and non-thrombogenic.  In 1965, Kay-Shiley’s non-rotating disc valve replaced the ball with a single disc but demonstrated poor hemodynamics and hemolysis and was discontinued. Bjork-Shiley in 1969 developed a tilting-disc valve, which overcame the problems with the single-disc valve. Free rotation of disc between metal struts allows it to open by tilting at a 60-degree angle. Bjork-Shiley replaced the flat with the convexo-concave disc to create a larger orifice in 1975 but were the object of a recall due to fracture of welded struts.  Medtronic Hall valve developed by Dr. Karl Hall and Robert Kaster is the most common tilting disc valve. Perforation in the middle of the disc served as a guide and an improved tilting angle. In 1977, St Jude Medical developed Bi-leaflet valve, which comprised two semi-circular flaps with hinges close to the center of the orifice. Stagnation of blood flow leading to thrombus formation around the hinge region was a problem with the bi-leaflet valve. A newly developed valve resolved this issue with a valve in which the continuous 360-degree rotation around the central axis of the valve ensured an even distribution of blood flow and prevent thrombus formation.  Predisposition for thrombosis, embolism, need for lifelong anticoagulation therapy are drawbacks of mechanical valves. Bioprosthetic valves can either be an allograft (cadaver or Ross procedure) or, a xenograft (native or pericardium). The Ross procedure involves replacing the diseased aortic valve with the patient’s own pulmonary valve (autograft) and replace the pulmonary valve with aortic or pulmonary allograft. The pulmonary autograft grows with the patient and does not induce an immunologic response. The most common xenografts are porcine aortic valves and bovine pericardial valves. Lonescu-Shiley developed xenograft valves by using bovine pericardium on a titanium stent in 1971 but was later withdrawn in 1987 due to structural failure including abrasive tears because of fabric-tissue interface and leaflet calcification. Carpentier-Edwards bovine pericardial valve overcame those issues by making some structural modifications, like stitching pericardium to the inside of the fabric and using flexible stent posts. Although biological valves have better hemodynamics compared to mechanical valves, they have a shorter lifespan because of calcification, which stiffens the valve leaflets. Tissues engineering, a field in regenerative medicine restores and maintains the function of living tissues. Skin graft for burn victims is an example. Tissue engineered heart valves (TEHV) are perceived to be non-thrombogenic, and infection resistant. With advancement in material science and culturing techniques, there is the possibility of a TEHV valve that is capable of growing, remodeling and repairing itself as the patients grow. Polymeric valves have been around for over 50 years, but because the earlier versions were prone to calcification and degradation, they were not widely used and instead only used in bridge devices like artificial hearts and left ventricular assist devices. Besides the advantage that they can be produced in various shapes and sizes, they are known to combine the durability of mechanical valves and the hydrodynamic function of bioprosthetic valves. The earliest polymeric valve implanted in a 44-year-old female in 1958 at the mitral position was a polyurethane design with Teflon chordae tendinae. Polyurethane valves have been found to have better hemodynamics compared to bioprosthetic valves and a lower incidence of thrombogenicity than mechanical valves. With advances in material sciences, the future of polymeric valves seems promising.  "
Transapical mitral valve-in-valve procedure with elective venoarterial ECMO in a patient with severe kyphoscoliosis.  ;Transcatheter mitral valve-in-valve replacement (TMVR) is a feasible alternative in high-risk patients requiring reoperation for failing mitral bioprosthesis. Such patients may present with hemodynamic instability or sudden complications, which may jeopardize the outcomes. We report a successful transapical TMVR in a patient, with severe kyphoscoliosis and on prolonged mechanical ventilation, with prophylactic extracorporeal membrane oxygenator support. This combined procedure may be helpful to reduce the complications of TMVR in critically ill subjects.  
An observational, prospective study on surgical treatment of secondary mitral regurgitation: The SMR study. Rationale, purposes, and protocol.  ;The natural history of secondary mitral regurgitation (MR) is unfavorable. Nevertheless, there are no evidence that its correction can improve the outcome. If from one side the original cause of secondary MR can be such to limit the possibilities of improvement, from the other side it is possible that the surgical technique widely applied to repair, restrictive mitral annuloplasty, is not adequate to correct the regurgitation. The addition of valvular and/or subvalvular techniques has been considered a possible technical solution. However, we do not know the prevalence of each technique, how many times mitral replacement is used to correct secondary MR. This aspect is of particular importance, as we know that a successful mitral repair causes a better left ventricular systolic remodeling than a unsuccessful repair or replacement. This study is a prospective, observational registry, conceived to understand what is done in the real world. Any surgeon will use the technique he thinks the most suitable for the patient. Every year, for 5 years, patients will have a clinical and echocardiographic follow-up, to evaluate the risk factors for a worse result (death, rehospitalization for heart failure, reoperation for MR return, moderate, or more MR return). This knowledge will give us the possibility to understand which is the technique, or the strategy, more efficient to treat this disease and the real efficacy of the surgical treatment.

International study on impact of COVID-19 on cardiac and thoracic aortic aneurysm surgery.  ;BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic gripped every nation's health care system and provisions on all levels. In cardiac and aortic surgery, as it is with most specialities, elective surgeries were halted. AIMS OF THE STUDY: We captured reflections, contingencies, and current practices across of high-volume centers in cardiac and aortic surgery globally. We also aimed this study to assess decision on prioritization of the surgical patients, the need for personal protection equipment, and the choice of preoperative investigations in current dynamic and fluid climate. METHODS: A validated web-based questionnaire was constructed and was circulated to the international surgeons amongst high volume cardiac and aortic surgery centers. Their intrinsic feedback on decision making, the impact of the lockdown, and perspectives for the future ahead of us all were noted. A mixed-method approach was constructed. Qualitative data analysis was introduced to signify the impact globally. RESULTS: Overall, 23 centers from 18 countries participated in this international study. About 91.7% of the respondents stopped operating on elective patients during the pandemic. The majority of the surgeons agreed that acute aortic dissection (87.1%) should be operated as an emergency procedure and stable triple vessel disease (87.1%) to be considered as an elective procedure. Three-fifth (60%) of the respondents relied on computerized tomography chest as a preoperative screening modality. CONCLUSION: In the present climate where there is a paucity of evidence, this will give an interim consensus for the cardiac surgeons. With the increase in the cumulative number of patients with COVID-19, careful utilization of the resources regarding hospital beds and manpower is of paramount importance.  
Early bioprosthetic tricuspid valve stenosis due to size mismatch in Ebstein anomaly-Successful transcatheter treatment.  ;"Patients with congenital heart disease are surviving well into adulthood thanks to advances in medical and clinical care. We present a patient with Ebstein anomaly who underwent surgical tricuspid valve replacement and suffered early valve stenosis due to her unique anatomy. This case highlights the importance of the ""unnatural"" anatomy that can be encounter in this challenging patient population.  "
Utility of Three-Dimensional (3D) Modeling for Planning Structural Heart Interventions (with an Emphasis on Valvular Heart Disease).  ;PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Advanced imaging has played a vital role in the contemporary, rapid rise of structural heart interventions. 3D modeling and printing has emerged as one of the most recent imaging tools and the implementation of 3D modeling is expected to increase with further advances in imaging, print hardware, and materials. RECENT FINDINGS: 3D modeling can be used to educate patients and clinical teams, provide ex vivo procedural simulation, and improve outcomes. Intra-procedural success rates may be improved, and post-procedural complications can be predicted more robustly with appropriate application of 3D modeling. Recent advances in technology have increased the availability of this tool, such that there can be more ready adoption into a routine clinical workflow. Familiarity with 3D modeling and its current utilization and role in structural interventions will help inform how to approach and adapt this exciting new technology.  
Catastrophic Cardiac Complications of Takayasu's Arteritis.  ;Takayasu's arteritis (TA) causes inflammation and necrosis of vessel walls, leading to aneurysm formation, extensive coronary damage and valvular abnormalities. We review a case of recurrent coronary, aortic and mitral valve involvement in a patient with TA and discuss the various treatment options available for such patients.  
Premature Onset Aortic Stenosis in Systemic Sclerosis: A Report of a Series of Cases.  ;Although cardiovascular involvement is a well-known complication correlated with a poor prognosis in patients with systemic sclerosis, there are few reports on valvular heart disease. Forty patients with systemic sclerosis were retrospectively analyzed. Valvular heart disease was found in six patients, five of whom had severe tri-leaflet aortic stenosis. Three of these 5 patients were ≤71 years old. Two frail elderly patients who underwent transcatheter aortic valve replacement died within two years. Premature-onset aortic stenosis is not uncommon in patients with systemic sclerosis. When considering mechanical intervention, the evaluation of frailty is important.  
Presentation and outcomes of mitral valve surgery in France in the recent era: a nationwide perspective.  ;"OBJECTIVES: Unbiased information regarding the surgical management of patients with mitral regurgitation (MR) at the nationwide level are scarce and mainly US-based. The Programme de Médicalisation des Systèmes d'Information, a mandatory national database, offers the unique opportunity to assess the presentation and outcomes of all consecutive mitral valve (MV) surgeries performed in France in the contemporary era. METHODS: We collected all MV surgeries performed for MR in France in 2014-2016. MR aetiology was classified as degenerative (DMR), secondary (SMR) or Other (rheumatic or congenital disease and infective endocarditis). RESULTS: During the 3-year period, 18 167 MV surgeries were performed in France (55% repair and 45% replacement; 52% isolated). Age was 66±12 years and 59% were male. Aetiology was DMR in 42%, SMR in 16% and other in 42% including 19% with uncertain aetiologies. Overall, in-hospital mortality was 6.5% and increased with age, female gender, Charlson Comorbidity Index, type of surgery (replacement vs repair), associated surgery (combined vs isolated) and MR aetiology (all p<0.01). In-hospital mortality and rate of death/readmission for heart failure (HF) at 1 year were 3.4% and 13%, respectively for DMR (2.4% and 11% for isolated DMR) and 7.8% and 27%, respectively for SMR (5.5% and 23% for isolated SMR). Repair rate was 55% overall, 68% in DMR and 72% for isolated DMR surgery (70% of all DMR). Repair rates decreased with age, Charlson Comorbidity Index and female sex (all p<0.0001). CONCLUSION: In this cross-sectional contemporary prospective nationwide database, in-hospital mortality and 1 year rate of death and HF readmission were considerable overall and in all subsets. Repair rates were suboptimal overall especially in the elderly and women subsets. These results underline the need to develop strategies to improve management and outcomes of patients with both DMR and SMR.  "
Management of a Compromised Frozen Elephant Trunk Due to Acute Type B Aortic Dissection.  ;PURPOSE: To report a case who required a thoracic endovascular stenting (TEVAR) following the deployment of frozen elephant trunk due to false lumen expansion. CASE REPORT: A 47 years old male patient undergone emergency repair of acute type A aortic dissection in 2011 with bioprosthetic aortic root conduit. Seven years later he presented with moderate aortic valve disease and expanding chronic dissection of the aortic arch, therefore a redo operation with replacement of the prosthetic aortic valve, ascending aorta, total arch and deployment of frozen elephant trunk and he was discharged in good health. Several days post discharge he presented with new onset of chest pain and a new dissection involved the thoracoabdominal aorta was noted pressing on the true lumen and the frozen elephant trunk. Following a multi-disciplinary team meeting, TEVAR was deemed as a most appropriate approach and this was achieved successfully, and patient was discharged. At 1 year of follow up, he remains well and asymptomatic. CONCLUSION: Close imaging follow-up following deployment of a FET is mandatory. A new acute Type B aortic dissection distal to the FET, that causes false lumen propagation parallel to the stented portion, is a surgical emergency and further intervention mandated.  
Contrast-Induced Acute Kidney Injury in Patients Undergoing TAVI Compared With Coronary Interventions.  ;"Background Differences in the impact of contrast medium on the development of contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) or a coronary angiography/percutaneous coronary intervention (CA/PCI) have not been previously investigated. Methods and Results Patients treated with TAVI or elective CA/PCI were retrospectively analyzed in terms of baseline and procedural characteristics, including preprocedural and postprocedural kidney function. CI-AKI was defined as a relative increase in serum creatinine concentration of at least 0.3 mg/dL within 72 hours of contrast-medium administration compared with baseline. The incidence of CI-AKI in the TAVI versus CA/PCI group was compared. After the exclusion of patients in dialysis and emergency procedures, 977 patients were analyzed; there were 489 patients who had undergone TAVI (50.1%) and 488 patients who had undergone CA/PCI (49.9%). Patients treated by TAVI were older, presenting a higher rate of anemia and chronic kidney disease (P<0.001 for all comparisons). Consistently, they also had a significantly lower glomerular filtration rate and higher serum creatinine concentration (P<0.001 for all). However, the occurrence of CI-AKI was significantly lower in these patients compared with patients treated by a CA/PCI (6.7% versus 14.5%, P<0.001). At multivariate analysis, the TAVI procedure had an independent protective effect on CI-AKI incidence among total population (odds ratio, 0.334; 95% CI, 0.193-0.579; P<0.001). This observation was confirmed after propensity score matching among 360 patients (180 by TAVI and 180 by CA/PCI; P=0.002). Conclusions CI-AKI occurred less frequently in patients undergoing TAVI than in patients undergoing a CA/PCI, despite a worse-risk profile. The impact of contrast administration on kidney function in patients who had undergone TAVI may be better tolerated because of the hemodynamic changes following aortic valve replacement.  "
Warfarin-induced toxic epidermal necrolysis after mitral valve replacement.  ;Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis are rare diseases that cause acute destruction of the epithelium of the skin and mucous membranes, almost always attributable to drugs. However, warfarin-induced Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis is extremely rare. We report the case of 71-year-old woman who died due to destructive erosion all over her skin and mucous membranes. She had received a mitral valve prosthesis, and warfarin was prescribed for antithrombotic therapy. A lymphocyte transformation test for drug hypersensitivity and the clinical history confirmed this phenomenon as warfarin-induced toxic epidermal necrolysis.  
Hemodynamic Performance of Dysfunctional Prosthetic Heart Valve with the Concomitant Presence of Subaortic Stenosis: In Silico Study.  ;The prosthetic heart valve is vulnerable to dysfunction after surgery, thus a frequent assessment is required. Doppler electrocardiography and its quantitative parameters are commonly used to assess the performance of the prosthetic heart valves and provide detailed information on the interaction between the heart chambers and related prosthetic valves, allowing early detection of complications. However, in the case of the presence of subaortic stenosis, the accuracy of Doppler has not been fully investigated in previous studies and guidelines. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the accuracy of the parameters in such cases to get early detection, and a proper treatment plan for the patient, at the right time. In the current study, a CFD simulation was performed for the blood flow through a Bileaflet Mechanical Heart Valve (BMHV) with concomitant obstruction in the Left Ventricle Outflow Tract (LVOT). The current study explores the impact of the presence of the subaortic on flow patterns. It also investigates the accuracy of (BMHV) evaluation using Doppler parameters, as proposed in the American Society of Echocardiography (ASE) guidelines.  
"Cesarean Delivery in a Parturient With ""Repaired"" Congenital Mitral Dysplasia and Severe Functional Mitral Stenosis: A Case Report.  ";We present the anesthetic management of a 23-year-old gravida 2 para 0-0-1-0 with a history of mitral valve replacement secondary to congenital mitral dysplasia. The hemodynamic changes of pregnancy had resulted in severe functional mitral stenosis of her mechanical valve, which was significantly undersized for her current body surface area. Her complex cardiac history required our multidisciplinary team to focus on peripartum anticoagulation management, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) preparation under a dural puncture epidural (DPE) technique, and managing the hemodynamic changes that are critical for a congenital heart disease parturient.  
New insights of tricuspid regurgitation: a large-scale prospective cohort study.  ;AIMS: To evaluate the burden of tricuspid regurgitation (TR) in a large cohort, determine the right ventricle involvement of patients with TR and determine the characteristics of isolated TR. METHODS AND RESULTS: Prospective study where consecutive patients undergoing an echocardiographic study in 10 centres were included. All studies with significant TR (at least moderate) were selected. We considered that patients with one of pulmonary systolic hypertension >50 mmHg, left ventricular ejection fraction <35%, New York Heart Association III-IV, or older than 85 years, had a high surgical risk. A total of 35 088 echocardiograms were performed. Significant TR was detected in 6% of studies. Moderate TR was found in 69.6%, severe in 25.5%, massive in 3.9%, and torrential in 1.0% of patients. Right ventricle was dilated in 81.7% of patients with massive/torrential TR, in 55.9% with severe TR, and in 29.3% with moderate TR (P < 0.001). Primary TR was present in 7.4% of patients whereas secondary TR was present in 92.6%. Mitral or aortic valve disease was the most common aetiology (54.6%), following by isolated TR (16%). Up to 51.9% of patients with severe, massive, or torrential primary TR and 57% of patients with severe, massive, or torrential secondary TR had a high surgical risk. CONCLUSION: Significant TR is a prevalent condition and a high proportion of these patients have an indication for valve intervention. More than a half of patients with severe, massive, or torrential TR had a high surgical risk. Massive/torrential TR may have implications regarding selection and monitoring patients for percutaneous treatment.  
Effectiveness of a novel, completely biomaterial valved pulmonary arterial conduit: An in vivo study.  ;As a pre-clinical assessment, the present study aimed to investigate the safety and effectiveness of a novel valved pulmonary arterial conduit constructed entirely from biomaterials by transplanting it in the outflow tract of the right ventricle in sheep. Under extracorporeal circulation, the valved pulmonary arterial conduit was used to replace the pulmonary artery of sheep with a beating heart. The performance was assessed at 30, 90 and 180 days post-surgery. Hemodynamic and structural changes were evaluated, and safety was assessed after 180 postoperative days. The hemodynamic effect and biosafety of the implant were further evaluated by observing the changes in various pressure indicators of the heart, echocardiographic results, anatomical and pathological examination results, liver and kidney functions, routine blood tests, a blood coagulation test, and other test results following implantation of the purely biotic valved conduit. The conduit was successfully implanted in 12 sheep and no mortality occurred postoperatively. During the 180-day follow-up, there was no obvious stenosis or regurgitation of the right ventricular outflow tract and pulmonary valve after valved conduit implantation. The findings of autopsy, pathology and laboratory examinations were unremarkable. The implantation of this biosynthetic vascular graft into animals meets the safety and effectiveness requirements for clinical application. This pulmonary arterial conduit has potential clinical application for children with complex congenital heart disease who require pulmonary artery reconstruction to achieve a radical cure.  
Comparison of Frequency of Vascular Complications With Ultrasound-Guided Versus Fluroscopic Roadmap-Guided Femoral Arterial Access in Patients Who Underwent Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.  ;To compare outcomes of ultrasound guidance (USG) versus fluoroscopy roadmap guidance (FG) angiography for femoral artery access in patients who underwent transfemoral (TF) transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) to determine whether routine USG use was associated with fewer vascular complications. Vascular complications are the most frequent procedural adverse events associated with TAVI. USG may provide a decreased rate of access site complications during vascular access compared with FG. Patients who underwent TF TAVI between July 2012 and July 2017 were reviewed and outcomes were compared. Vascular complications were categorized by Valve Academic Research Consortium-2 criteria and analyzed by a multivariable logistic regression adjusting for potential confounding risk factors including age, gender, body mass index, peripheral vascular disease, Society of Thoracic Surgeons score and sheath to femoral artery ratio. Of the 612 TAVI patients treated, 380 (63.1%) were performed using USG for access. Routine use of USG began in March 2015 and increased over time. Vascular complications occurred in 63 (10.3%) patients and decreased from 20% to 3.9% during the study period. There were fewer vascular complications with USG versus FG (7.9% vs 14.2%, p = 0.014). After adjusting for potential confounding risk factors that included newer valve systems, smaller sheath sizes and lower risk patients, there was still a 49% reduction in vascular complications with USG (odds ratio 0.51, 95% confidence interval 0.29 to 0.88, p = 0.02). In conclusion, USG for TF TAVI was associated with reduced vascular access site complications compared with FG access even after accounting for potential confounding risk factors and should be considered for routine use for TF TAVI.  
Sex-Specific Features of Calcific Aortic Valve Disease.  ;Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is the most common valvular heart disease in developed countries predominantly affecting the elderly population therefore posing a large economic burden. It is a gradually progressive condition ranging from mild valve calcification and thickening, without the hemodynamic obstruction, to severe calcification impairing leaflet motion, known as aortic stenosis (AS). The progression of CAVD occurs over many years, and it is extremely variable among individuals. It is also associated with an increased risk of coronary events and mortality. The recent insights into the CAVD pathophysiology included an important role of sex. Accumulating evidence suggests that, in patients with CAVD, sex can determine important differences in the relationship between valvular calcification process, fibrosis, and aortic stenosis hemodynamic severity between men and women. Consequently, it has implications on the development of different valvular phenotypes, left ventricular hypertrophy, and cardiovascular outcomes in men and women. Along these lines, taking into account the sex-related differences in diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment outcomes is of profound importance. In this review, the sex-related differences in patients with CAVD, in terms of pathobiology, clinical phenotypes, and outcomes were discussed.  
Biventricular myocardial adaptation in patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot: Mechanistic insights from magnetic resonance imaging tissue phase mapping.  ;BACKGROUND: The myocardial adaptive mechanism in patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot (rTOF) is less understood. We aimed to investigate biventricular myocardial adaptive remodeling in rTOF patients. METHODS: We recruited 32 rTOF patients and 38 age- and sex-matched normal controls. The pulmonary stenosis of rTOF patients was measured using catheterized pressure gradient between right ventricle (RV) and pulmonary artery (PGRVPA). rTOF patients with PGRVPA < 15 mmHg and ≥15 mmHg were classified as low pulmonary stenosis (rTOFlow, n = 19) and high pulmonary stenosis (rTOFhigh, n = 13) subgroups, respectively. Magnetic resonance imaging tissue phase mapping was employed to evaluate the voxelwise biventricular myocardial motion in longitudinal (Vz), radial (Vr), and circumferential (Vφ) directions. RESULTS: The rTOFlow subgroup presented higher pulmonary regurgitation fraction than rTOFhigh subgroup (p < 0.001). Compared with the normal group, only rTOFlow subgroup presented a decreased RV ejection fraction (RVEF) (p < 0.05). The rTOFlow subgroup showed decreased systolic and diastolic Vz in RV and LV, whereas rTOFhigh subgroup showed such change only in RV. In rTOFlow subgroup, RVEF significantly correlated with RV systolic Vr (r = 0.56, p < 0.05), whereas LVEF correlated with LV systolic Vz (r = 0.51, p = 0.02). Prolonged QRS correlated with RV systolic Vr (r = -0.58, p < 0.01) and LV diastolic Vr (r = 0.81, p < 0.001). No such correlations occurred in rTOFhigh subgroup. CONCLUSIONS: The avoidance of unfavorable functional interaction in RV and LV in rTOFhigh subgroup suggested that adequate pulmonary stenosis (PGRVPA ≥ 15 mmHg in this sereis) has a protective effect against pulmonary regurgitation.  
In-hospital stroke after transcatheter aortic valve implantation: A UK observational cohort analysis.  ;"OBJECTIVES: We sought to identify baseline demographics and procedural factors that might independently predict in-hospital stroke following transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). BACKGROUND: Stroke is a recognized, albeit infrequent, complication of TAVI. Established predictors of procedure-related in-hospital stroke; however, remain poorly defined. METHODS: We conducted an observational cohort analysis of the multicenter UK TAVI registry. The primary outcome measure was the incidence of in-hospital stroke. RESULTS: A total of 8,652 TAVI procedures were performed from 2007 to 2015. There were 205 in-hospital strokes reported by participating centers equivalent to an overall stroke incidence of 2.4%. Univariate analysis showed that the implantation of balloon-expandable valves caused significantly fewer strokes (balloon-expandable 96/4,613 [2.08%] vs. self-expandable 95/3,272 [2.90%]; p = .020). After multivariable analysis, prior cerebrovascular disease (CVD) (odds ratio [OR] 1.51, 95% confidence interval [CI 1.05-2.17]; p = .03), advanced age at time of operation (OR 1.02 [0.10-1.04]; p = .05), bailout coronary stenting (OR 5.94 [2.03-17.39]; p = .008), and earlier year of procedure (OR 0.93 [0.87-1.00]; p = .04) were associated with an increased in-hospital stroke risk. There was a reduced stroke risk in those who had prior cardiac surgery (OR 0.62 [0.41-0.93]; p = .01) and a first-generation balloon-expandable valve implanted (OR 0.72 [0.53-0.97]; p = .03). In-hospital stroke significantly increased 30-day (OR 5.22 [3.49-7.81]; p < .001) and 1-year mortality (OR 3.21 [2.15-4.78]; p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: In-hospital stroke after TAVI is associated with substantially increased early and late mortality. Factors independently associated with in-hospital stroke were previous CVD, advanced age, no prior cardiac surgery, and deployment of a predominantly first-generation self-expandable transcatheter heart valve.

A Review of Selected Adult Congenital Heart Diseases Encountered in Daily Practice.  ;The advancement in corrective surgical procedures and anaesthesia technology has resulted in the increase survival of patients with Congenital Heart Diseases (CHD). Most of the surviving CHD patients have successfully reached adulthood and those surviving adults now outnumber the infants born with the CHD. Unfortunately, the surviving adults with CHD do not get proper care due to either inconsistent follow up or not getting care from a specialist in the field of CHD. It is imperative for general practicing clinicians to be aware of the congenital diseases as well as the current clinical recommendations. This manuscript reviews some of the common congenital diseases seen in adults such as cardiac shunts, left heat obstructive lesions and aortopathies.  
Coronary Embolism and Myocardial Infarction: A Scoping Study.  ;Coronary embolism is a cause of acute myocardial infarction (AMI)in which obstructive foci enter the coronary circulation, block normal blood flow and precipitate ischemia. Precise studies focusing on patient population affected, pathophysiological mechanisms, and treatment strategies are scanty, in spite of a reported prevalence estimated at 2.9%. As the understanding of myocardial infarction without evidence of coronary artery disease continues to grow, an in-depth review of this previously seldomly reported subtype of coronary ischemia was in order. Patients suffering coronary embolism are 15 to 20 years younger than traditional AMI patients with a slight predominance towards male sex, which resembles the gender data of the populations affected by non-traditional myocardial infarction in published reports. While the expected prevalence rate of cardiovascular disease risk factors such as hypertension and hyperlipidemia are present, this population also has a relatively high prevalence of atrial fibrillation and valve pathology, especially endocarditis. Initial presentation is indistinguishable from other causes of myocardial infarction however fever is commonly present, when endocarditis with valvular involvement is the primary cause of the coronary embolism. Mechanical thrombectomy is the mainstay of treatment, followed by percutaneous coronary intervention. Mortality is the highest in patients who do not receive targeted treatment for the coronary embolism, particularly if only antimicrobial agents or anticoagulation without thrombolytic agents are employed. The unique features of coronary embolism highlighted in this historical study justify further examination in contemporary patient populations.  
Undersizing but overfilling eliminates the gray zones of sizing for transcatheter aortic valve replacement with the balloon-expandable bioprosthesis.  ;BACKGROUND: Current recommendations for valve size selection are based on multidimensional annular measurements, yet the overlap between two different transcatheter heart valve (THV) sizes remains. We sought to evaluate whether undersizing but overfilling eliminates the gray zones of valve sizing. METHODS: Data of 246 consecutive patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) with the balloon-expandable bioprosthesis with either conventional sizing and nominal filling (group 1 (NF-TAVR), n = 154) or undersizing but overfilling under a Less Is More (LIM)-Principle (group 2 (LIM-TAVR), n = 92) were compared. Paravalvular leakage (PVL) was graded angiographically and quantitatively using invasive hemodynamics. RESULTS: Annulus rupture (AR) occurred only in group 1 (n = 3). Due to AR adequate evaluation of PVL was possible in 152 patients of group 1. More than mild PVL was found in 13 (8.6%) patients of group 1 and 1 (1.1%) patient of group 2 (p = 0.019). Postdilatation was performed in 31 (20.1%) patients of group 1 and 6 patients (6.5%) of group 2 (p = 0.003). For patients with borderline annulus size in group 1 (n = 35, 22.7%) valve size selection was left to the physiciańs choice resulting in selection of the larger prosthesis in 10 (28.6%). In group 2 all patients with borderline annulus (n = 36, 39.1%) received the smaller prosthesis (LIM-TAVR). The postprocedural mean transvalvular pressure gradient was significantly higher in the NF-TAVR-group (11.7 ± 4 vs. 10.1 ± 3.6 mmHg, p = 0.005). CONCLUSION: LIM-TAVR eliminates the gray zones of sizing and associated PVL, can improve THV-performance, reduce incidence of annular rupture and simplify the procedure especially in borderline cases.  
Spontaneous pneumothorax in a single lung transplant recipient-a blessing in disguise: A case report.  ;BACKGROUND: End-stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the common lung diseases referred for lung transplantation. According to the international society of heart and lung transplantation, 30% of all lung transplantations are carried out for COPD alone. When compared to bilateral lung transplant, single-lung transplant (SLT) has similar short-term and medium-term results for COPD. For patients with severe upper lobe predominant emphysema, lung volume reduction surgery is an excellent alternative which results in improvement in functional status and long-term mortality. In 2018, endobronchial valves were approved by the Food and Drug Administration for severe upper lobe predominant emphysema as they demonstrated improvement in lung function, exercise capacity, and quality of life. However, the role of endobronchial valves in native lung emphysema in SLT patients has not been studied. CASE SUMMARY: We describe an unusual case of severe emphysema who underwent a successful SLT 15 years ago and had gradual worsening of lung function suggestive of chronic lung allograft dysfunction. However, her lung function improved significantly after a spontaneous pneumothorax of the native lung resulting in auto-deflation of large bullae. CONCLUSION: This case highlights the clinical significance of native lung hyperinflation in single lung transplant recipient and how spontaneous decompression due to pneumothorax led to clinical improvement in our patient.  
In-Hospital Outcomes and Trends of Tricuspid Valve Surgery in Heart Transplant Patients.  ;INTRODUCTION: Tricuspid valve (TV) regurgitation is the most common valvular pathology after orthotopic heart transplant (OHT). The number of transplants being performed is increasing with patients living longer after heart transplant. Data on TV surgery in OHT recipients is limited. METHODS: We sought to analyze the outcomes of patients undergoing TV surgery from a large diverse, multicentric, nationwide cohort using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database. RESULTS: A total of 42,766 TV repair or replacement (bioprosthetic and mechanical) involving adult patients (age ≥18 years) between 2007 and September 2015 were identified. Of these, 366 were performed in patients with OHT. TV repair was the most common surgery performed in both groups (OHT group and native heart group). Compared to the native group, patients with OHT had a significantly higher incidence of cardiogenic shock (20 vs. 11%, p = 0.024), acute kidney injury (AKI) (59 vs. 30%, p < 0.001), and AKI requiring hemodialysis (13 vs. 4%, p < 0.001). Also, the mean length of stay for the index admission was significantly longer in the OHT group (27 vs. 17 days, p = 0.008). The mortality rate was similar between the two groups (7 vs. 8%, p = 0.753). The number of TV surgeries performed in OHT patients from 2007 to 2014 have remained stable (p = 0.803) compared to those in native heart patients which showed a significantly increasing trend (p = 0.019) during the same time period. CONCLUSIONS: TV surgery remains an important treatment modality among the OHT population and carries a similar mortality during index hospitalization as that in native heart patients undergoing TV surgery.  
Cutaneous-Pericardial Fistula: Rare Complication of Transapical Aortic Valve Replacement-Case Report and Literature Review.  ;"Cutaneous-pericardial fistula is a rare complication of transapical aortic valve replacement; only a few cases are reported in the literature. It is part of a wide range of surgical site infection manifestations that could emerge after surgery. Due to its proximity to the heart, the risk of infectious lesions of adjacent structures and inoculation of pathogens on the prosthetic valve can lead to life-threatening complications. We report here a case of successful surgical treatment through reduced ribs and soft tissue operative trauma.  "
Efficacy of Manual Hemostasis for Percutaneous Axillary Artery Intra-Aortic Balloon Pump Removal.  ;BACKGROUND: The prevalence of peripheral vascular disease has led to the re-emergence of percutaneous axillary vascular access as a suitable alternative access site to femoral artery. We sought to investigate the efficacy and safety of manual hemostasis in the axillary artery. METHODS: Data were collected from a prospective internal registry of patients who had a Maquet® (Rastatt, Germany) Mega 50 cc intra-aortic balloon pumps (IABP) placed in the axillary artery position. They were anticoagulated with weight-based intravenous heparin to maintain an activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of 50-80 seconds. Anticoagulation was discontinued 2 hours prior to the device explantation. Manual compression was used to achieve the hemostasis of the axillary artery. Vascular and bleeding complications attributable to manual hemostasis were classified based on the Valve Academic Research Consortium-2 (VARC-2) and Bleeding Academic Research Consortium-2 (BARC-2) classifications, respectively. RESULTS: 29 of 46 patients (63%) achieved axillary artery homeostasis via manual compression. The median duration of IABP implantation was 12 days (range 1-54 days). Median compression time was 20 minutes (range 5-60 minutes). There were no major vascular or bleeding complications as defined by the VARC-2 and BARC-2 criteria, respectively. CONCLUSION: Manual compression of the axillary artery appears to be an effective and safe method for achieving hemostasis. Large prospective randomized control trials may be needed to corroborate these findings.  
Comparison of Outcomes of Coronary Revascularization for Acute Myocardial Infarction in Men Versus Women.  ;This study sought to examine the differences in the characteristics and outcomes between men and women who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in contemporary US practice. The Nationwide Inpatient Sample was used to identify patients who underwent revascularization for AMI between January 1, 2003 and December 31, 2016. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Propensity score matching was utilized to account for differences in baseline characteristics. In total, 3,603,142 patients were included, of whom only 1,180,436 (33%) were women. Compared with men, women were older and had higher prevalence of key co-morbidities including diabetes, hypertension, congestive heart failure, and chronic kidney and lung disease (p <0.001). In the PCI cohort, women were significantly less likely to undergo multivessel PCI, to receive mechanical circulatory support, or to undergo atherectomy. In the CABG group, women were more likely to have concomitant valve surgery. In the propensity-matched cohorts, in-hospital mortality was higher for women than men regardless of revascularization strategy: 7.6% versus 6.6% for PCI in ST-elevation myocardial infarction, 2.0% versus 1.9% for PCI in non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, and 5.7% versus 4.3% for CABG in any AMI (p <0.001). Women also had higher rates of major complications, longer hospitalizations, higher costs, and were less likely to be discharged home (vs nursing facility). These sex-based differences persisted over the study 14-year period. In conclusion, in a contemporary nationwide analysis of propensity score-matched patients, women who undergo revascularization for AMI have worse in-hospital outcomes than men regardless of revascularization mode.  
Management of Aortic Stenosis in Patients With End-Stage Renal Disease on Hemodialysis.  ;BACKGROUND: Patients with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis (ESRD-HD) and aortic stenosis have poor prognosis. The role of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in this high-risk population is debated. METHODS: We compared the outcomes among ESRD-HD Medicare beneficiaries who were managed with TAVR, surgical AVR (SAVR), or conservative management for aortic stenosis between 2015 and 2017, using overlap propensity score weighting analysis to control for differences in treatment assignment. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality and was compared between treatment groups as well as to age-sex matched mortality for ESRD-HD in the US population. Secondary outcomes included trend of heart failure hospitalizations. RESULTS: A total of 8107 ESRD-HD patients with aortic stenosis were included, 4130 (50%) underwent TAVR, 2565 (31.6%) underwent SAVR, and 1412 (17.4%) were managed conservatively. TAVR patients had more comorbidities and higher frailty compared with the other 2 groups. Thirty-day mortality was lower with TAVR compared with SAVR (4.6% versus 12.8%, P<0.01). After a median follow-up of 465 days (interquartile range, 261-759), on overlap propensity score weighting analysis, there was no difference in mortality between TAVR and SAVR (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.02 [95% CI, 0.91-1.15], P=0.7), and mortality was lower with TAVR compared with conservative management (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.53 [95% CI, 0.47-0.60], P<0.001). Standardized mortality ratios with TAVR, SAVR, and conservative management compared with age-sex matched ESRD-HD US population were 1.24, 1.27, and 1.83, respectively. The rate of heart failure admissions declined after TAVR (incidence rate ratio, 0.55 [95% CI, 0.48-0.62], P<0.001) and SAVR (incidence rate ratio, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.65-0.88], P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In ESRD-HD patients with aortic stenosis, mortality was lower in the short-term with TAVR compared with SAVR but comparable in the mid-term. AVR is associated with an improvement in survival and reduction in heart failure hospitalizations compared with conservative management.  
The value of electrocardiography and echocardiography in distinguishing Fabry disease from sarcomeric hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  ;"BACKGROUND: Screening for Fabry disease is sub-optimal in non-specialised centres. AIM: To assess the diagnostic value of electrocardiographic scores of left ventricular hypertrophy and a combined electrocardiographic and echocardiographic model in Fabry disease. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the electrocardiograms and echocardiograms of 61 patients (mean age 55.6±11.5 years; 57% men) with Fabry disease and left ventricular hypertrophy, and compared them with those from 59 patients (mean age 44.8±18.3 years; 66% men) with sarcomeric hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Six electrocardiography criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy were specifically analysed: Sokolow-Lyon voltage index; Cornell voltage index; Gubner index; Romhilt-Estes score; Sokolow-Lyon product (voltage index×QRS duration); and Cornell product (voltage index×QRS duration). RESULTS: Right bundle branch block was more frequent in patients with Fabry disease (54% vs. 22%; P=0.001). QRS duration, Gubner score and Sokolow-Lyon product were significantly higher in patients with Fabry disease. Maximal wall thickness was higher in patients with sarcomeric hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (21.9±5.1 vs. 15.5±2.9mm; P<0.001). Indexed sinus of Valsalva diameter was larger in patients with Fabry disease. After multivariable analysis, right bundle branch block, Sokolow-Lyon product, maximal wall thickness and aortic diameter were independently associated with Fabry disease. A model including these four variables yielded an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.918 (95% confidence interval 0.868-0.968) for Fabry disease. CONCLUSION: Our model combining easy-to-assess electrocardiographic and echocardiographic variables may be helpful in improving screening and reducing diagnosis delay in Fabry disease.  "
Transcatheter mitral valve repair in patients with chronic liver disease: Insights from the national inpatient sample.  ;"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate contemporary national trends of morbidity, mortality, and healthcare utilization in patients with mitral regurgitation (MR) and co-existing chronic liver disease (CLD) undergoing transcatheter mitral valve repair (TMVR). METHODS: The National Inpatient Sample (NIS) was used to assess trends in patients undergoing TMVR between January 2012 and December 2017. Propensity match analysis was done to compare it to subjects without underlying CLD. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify predictors of in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Of 15,270 patients undergoing TMVR, 569 (3.7%) had coexisting CLD. Patients with CLD had a higher proportion of males (61.3 vs 52.6%; p < .01), congestive heart failure (6.9 vs 1.0%; p < .01), renal failure (42.2 vs 36.7%; p < .01), and peripheral vascular disease (19.3 vs 12.5%; p < .01). After propensity matching subjects with CLD had significantly higher hospital mortality (19.8 vs 4.6%; p < .01), acute kidney injury (46.1 vs 37.8%; p < .01), cardiogenic shock (25.4 vs 12.1%; p < .01), mechanical ventilation (26.3 vs 14.0; p < .01), pneumothorax (6.6 vs <2%.; p < .01), length of stay (5 vs 9 days), and average cost of hospitalization (209,573 vs 250,587 $; p < .01). Over the years, in-hospital mortality in patients receiving TMVR has improved in both patients with (from 33.3 in 2013 to 22.2% in 2017) and without CLD (from 2.7 in 2011 to 1.6% in 2017). CONCLUSION: Patients with MR undergoing TMVR, with coexisting CLD bear substantially higher comorbidities, complication rates, and inpatient mortality compared with those without CLD. A favorable temporal trend of in-hospital mortality among these subjects is noteworthy.  "
Incidence and short-term outcomes of surgical bailout after transcatheter mitral valve repair with the MitraClip system.  ;"OBJECTIVES: This study sought to investigate the incidence and outcomes of surgical bailout (SB) after transcatheter mitral valve repair (TMVr) with MitraClip. BACKGROUND: TMVr poses a risk of serious procedural complications, possibly requiring urgent open surgery for SB. However, little is known about the risk of SB cases after TMVr. METHODS: We retrospectively identified patients who underwent TMVr using the Nationwide Readmissions Database 2014-2017. SB was defined as open thoracotomy for heart and aorta during the same hospitalization. Annual hospital volume was defined as the annual number of TMVr cases in each hospital in each year. RESULTS: Among 15,032 eligible patients, SB was required in 214 (1.42%), of whom 134 (62.6%) underwent mitral valve surgery (113 replacements; 21 repairs). The incidence of SB was decreasing significantly over the 4 years (5.26% in 2014; 0.43% in 2017; ptrend  < .001). There was a significant nonlinear, inverse association of annual hospital volume with the incidence of SB. In-hospital death (15.0 vs. 2.1%; p < .001) and other in-hospital adverse events were significantly more frequent in patients with than without SB, whereas the 30-day readmission rate was similar (13.2 vs. 15.1%; p = .572). After adjustment for patient and hospital characteristics, SB was significantly associated with higher in-hospital mortality (odds ratio = 6.67, 95% confidence interval = 4.35, 10.23, p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that although the incidence of SB after TMVr is decreasing, SB is required more frequently in lower-volume hospitals and carries high in-hospital mortality. Further efforts are needed to understand the reasons for SB and improve outcomes in patients needing SB.  "
ACURATE neo: How Is This TAVR Valve Doing to Fit into an Increasingly Crowded Field?  ;PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Critical appraisal of the available evidence on the self-expanding ACURATE neo transcatheter heart valve (THV) for the treatment of aortic valve disease. RECENT FINDINGS: In an investigator-initiated, multicenter, randomized non-inferiority trial with broad inclusion criteria, ACURATE neo failed to meet non-inferiority compared with SAPIEN 3 with regard to a primary composite safety and efficacy endpoint at 30 days. The difference was driven by higher rates of moderate or severe paravalvular regurgitation and higher rates of acute kidney injury. In turn, registry data suggest that the safety and efficacy profile of the ACURATE neo is comparable to that of other commercially available devices. Randomized evidence indicated favorable hemodynamic results with large effective orifice areas and low residual gradients. The self-expanding ACURATE neo THV is associated with higher rates of residual aortic regurgitation compared to the balloon-expandable SAPIEN 3 THV. The supra-annular design with low residual gradients may be advantageous in patients with small anatomy and mild degree of calcification.  
The Role of Echocardiography in the Cancer Patient.  ;PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To review the uses of echocardiography in patients with cancer and how it has expanded beyond the typical monitoring of systolic function during potentially cardiotoxic cancer therapeutics. RECENT FINDINGS: In addition to myocardial strain imaging being a predictor of subsequent left ventricular dysfunction, it can be used for pattern recognition to help identify patients with cardiac amyloidosis or Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Echocardiography is essential for diagnosis and planning of intervention for aortic stenosis in radiation-induced valvular disease, for which transcutaneous aortic valve replacement that gives many cancer patients that are not surgical candidates an option for treatment. The safety of transesophageal echocardiography has recently been demonstrated in patients with cancer with thrombocytopenia and depleted white blood cell counts who are at increased risk of endocarditis. Echocardiography is an essential tool for evaluating common conditions in cancer patients such as pericardial disease, radiation-induced heart disease, and intracardiac tumors-with specific uses of specialized echocardiography techniques such as deformation imaging, transesophageal echocardiography, and point-of-care ultrasound.  
Aortic Valve Replacement in Young and Middle-Aged Adults: Current and Potential Roles of TAVR.  ;BACKGROUND: Contemporary practice patterns and outcomes for aortic valve replacement (AVR) among young and middle aged adults are unknown given guideline modifications for surgical AVR (SAVR) and increasing transcatheter AVR (TAVR) acceptance. We describe SAVR/TAVR use and outcomes using the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) National Databases. METHODS: Adults 18-55 years in the Congenital Heart Surgery Database (CHSD) and the Adult Cardiac Surgery Database (ACSD) undergoing SAVR/TAVR from 2013-2018 were included. Perioperative characteristics and early outcomes were described by valve type. Multivariable regression identified determinants of death, length of hospital stay (LOS), and composite endpoint of renal failure, persistent neurological deficit, readmission, and reoperation. RESULTS: We analyzed 1,580 unique CHSD and 44,173 ACSD operations, with 16% having congenital heart disease. Valve utilization included TAVR 1%, mechanical 42%, bioprosthetic 55%, autograft 0.6%, homograft 1.2%, and Ozaki 0.4%. Over time, TAVR volumes increased by 167%. Thirty-day mortality was: TAVR 3.8%, mechanical 3.2%, bioprosthetic 3.7%, autograft 0.6%, homograft 9%, and Ozaki 3.4%. Stroke rate was lower for isolated SAVR vs. isolated TAVR (0.9% vs. 2.4%, p=0.002). In multivariable analyses, mortality risk was lower with mechanical valves, congenital morbidity risk was higher with TAVR, and LOS was shorter with TAVR. CONCLUSIONS: TAVR is increasingly used for adults <55 years. Given the uniformly excellent results with SAVR, including both mortality and morbidity - particularly regarding stroke, our data favor SAVR in this population, but a prospective trial is needed. Ongoing efforts to harmonize variables and outcomes definitions between the ACSD and CHSD are valuable.  
Transvenous Endomyocardial Biopsy: A Comparison of 2 Approaches.  ;BACKGROUND: Endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) is a well-established procedure for the diagnosis of specific myocardial diseases and represents the gold standard in monitoring allografts after heart transplantation. In our study, we compared 2 different approaches for harvesting EMB in order to optimize patient safety and efficacy of the procedure. METHODS: As a standard approach for harvesting EMB, a venous introducer sheath was inserted percutaneously via the internal jugular vein using the Seldinger technique. Thereafter, a bioptome was repeatedly introduced throughout this sheath into the right ventricle (RV), each time passing the tricuspid valve (TV). Alternatively, a coronary sinus catheter was inserted via an introducer sheath placed in the subclavian vein and only once was introduced into RV cavity. Hence, just a unique passage of TV was required. Thereafter, a bioptome was introduced via this catheter and precisely guided to the targeted biopsy site. RESULTS: A standard approach was used with 34 patients, and a modified technique was used with 37 patients. Patient characteristics were comparable in both cohorts, and analyses of peri-procedural parameters identified only marginal differences between the groups. Interestingly, the number of harvested tissue samples per procedure was higher in the modified approach compared to the standard approach. No complications occurred. CONCLUSION: The modified approach for EMB is a safe procedure. The facilitated bioptome-guidance and enhanced protection of TV may prevent periprocedural complications.  
An 8-Year-Old Boy With a Giant Left Atrium.  ;An 8-year-old boy was referred to our institution because of nausea and vomiting for 1 day. He had also been experiencing shortness of breath for more than 1 year. This symptom had progressed so that he could no longer run or walk upstairs without chest discomfort. There was no associated fever, diarrhea, or coughing. He had a history of heart murmur that was diagnosed in another clinic 4 years ago. Echocardiogram 4 years prior suggested mild to moderate biatrial enlargement with trivial mitral valve regurgitation. He did not go in for any follow-up until this admission. He had no other associated diseases, nor use of medicine.  
Ahmed T(1), Ahmad M(2), Mungee S(3).  ;Cardiac calcification is a broad term that refers to calcium deposits in the heart valves, coronary arteries, myocardium, and pericardium. There is a unique significance of these calcifications in each of these cardiac areas. While coronary artery calcifications can help risk-stratify intermediate-risk patients into low or high risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), calcifications of valves lead to narrowing of the valve causing stenosis and flow abnormalities and hence symptoms from valve narrowing. Pericardial calcifications may indicate constrictive pericarditis, while myocardial calcification can be a result of previous global myocardial injury (or infarction). When dense and heavy, calcifications can be detected by chest x-rays. However, a more dedicated study such as computed tomogram (CT) for myocardial and pericardial calcifications, cardiac computed tomogram angiogram (CCTA) for coronary artery calcifications (CAC), and echocardiogram for valvular calcifications are more specific studies.  
Pujari SH(1), Agasthi P(1).  ;Aortic stenosis is a common valvular disorder leading to left ventricular outflow obstruction. The anterograde velocity across the valve must be at least 2 m/sec, whereas the aortic valve sclerosis is the thickening and calcification without a significant pressure gradient. Etiologies include congenital (bicuspid/unicuspid), calcific, and rheumatic disease. Symptoms such as exertional dyspnea or fatigue gradually develop after a long asymptomatic latent period of about 10 to 20 years. Patients go on to develop chest pain, heart failure, and syncope. The definitive treatment for aortic stenosis includes aortic valve replacement, either via a surgical or percutaneous approach. Survival is excellent during the asymptomatic phase, but mortality is more than 90% within a few years after the onset of symptoms.  
Nepal S(1), Annamaraju P(2).  ;Coronary arteriovenous fistula (CAVF) is a rare form of congenital heart disease. However, it is the most common type of congenital coronary artery anomalies..An arteriovenous fistula is an abnormal conduit between the artery and vein, typically bypassing the capillaries in between. When present between the coronary artery and cardiac chambers, it is called a coronary cameral fistula.  The fistula can also be present between a coronary artery and another adjacent vessel from pulmonary or systemic circulation. A patent fistula provides a low resistance flow, shunting the blood directly from an artery into a vein, cardiac chamber, or another low-pressure vessel like the pulmonary artery. Patients with CAVF can develop symptoms at birth or a later age, depending on the type of fistula and the presence of collateral circulation. Studies have reported an association between ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death syndromes in young adults and athletes in certain types of coronary anomalies like the anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA). Exertional dyspnea and angina pectoris from myocardial ischemia or endocardial fibrosis are the predominant symptoms in adults. Typically, these patients have extensive collateral formation. Human coronary circulation comprises of two main epicardial coronary arteries. They arise from the coronary ostia located in the coronary sinus of Valsalva situated just above the aortic valve cusps. The aortic valve is tricuspid and consists of the right coronary cusp, left coronary cusp, and noncoronary cusp. The left coronary artery (LCA) originates from the left coronary sinus and branches into the left circumflex and the left anterior descending artery (LAD). The left circumflex artery supplies the anterolateral and posterolateral left ventricular walls. The left anterior descending artery supplies the anterior septum, the anterior free wall at the base and mid cavity level, apical septum, anterior wall, and apical cap. The right coronary artery (RCA)  arises from the anterior aortic sinus or the right coronary sinus. It supplies the right atrium, right ventricle, sinoatrial (SA) node, and atrioventricular (AV) node. The posterior descending artery, a branch of RCA, provides blood supply to the inferior septum, the inferior free wall, and posterior left ventricular segments. The right coronary artery dominant variant is 80%. The right coronary artery is the most common site of origin for CAVFs, found in approximately 50% of patients. Other sites include the left anterior descending artery in 35% to 40%, the left circumflex artery in 5% to 20%, and both coronary arteries in 5%. Approximately 90% of the fistulas drain into the low-pressure venous circulation. The most common drainage sites are the right ventricle 41%, right atrium 26%, pulmonary artery 17%, coronary sinus 7%, left atrium 26%, left ventricle 3%, and superior vena cava 1%. A coronary arteriovenous fistula may lead to coronary artery dilatation due to increased flow, hyperkinetic pulmonary artery hypertension due to the large left to right shunt, congestive heart failure, myocardial ischemia from coronary steal phenomenon and thrombosis or aneurysm of fistula.  
Douedi S(1), Douedi H(2).  ;Mitral regurgitation (MR) is caused by the retrograde flow of blood from the left ventricle (LV) into the left atrium (LA) through the mitral valve (MV), causing a systolic murmur heard best at the apex of the heart with radiation to the left axilla. MR is the most common valvular abnormality worldwide, affecting over 2% of the total population and has a prevalence that increases with age. This article will review and summarize the characteristics, pathophysiology, etiology, management, and treatment of mitral regurgitation.  Anatomy of Mitral Valve The mitral valve consists of two leaflets (anterior and posterior) sitting within the annulus. The posterior mitral leaflet originates from the left atrial (LA) endocardium. A subvalvular apparatus, comprising of 2 papillary muscles (anterolateral and posteromedial), arise from the LV myocardium and the chordae tendineae, supporting the leaflets.  Types of MR  Mitral regurgitation can subdivide into primary and secondary causes.  Primary Mitral Regurgitation: Also called degenerative or organic. Any MR resulting from structural deformity of or damage to the leaflets, chordae, and/or papillary muscles causing leaflets to close insufficiently during systole. Common causes: papillary muscle rupture, mitral valve prolapse (MVP), or leaflet perforation. Secondary Mitral Regurgitation: Also called functional or ischemic. Due to a left ventricular wall motion abnormalities (i.e., ischemic cardiomyopathy) or left ventricular remodeling (i.e., dilated cardiomyopathy). No structural problems with the valve itself. Leads to mitral annular dilatation or displacement of papillary muscles causing retrograde flow from improperly closed mitral valve leaflets. Carpentier's Classification: Type 1: Normal leaflet motion: Caused by annular dilation or leaflet perforation. Regurgitation jet directed centrally. Type 2: Excessive leaflet motion: Caused by papillary muscle rupture, chordal rupture, or redundant chordae. Eccentric jet directed away from the involved leaflet. Type 3: Restricted leaflet motion: IIIa: Leaflet motion restricted in both systole and diastole: Caused by rheumatic heart disease commonly. Normal papillary muscles. Jet may be centrally or eccentrically directed . IIIb: Leaflet motion restricted in systole : Caused by papillary muscle dysfunction or left ventricular dilation. Abnormal papillary muscles. Jet may be centrally or eccentrically directed.  
Ahmad SA(1), Shlofmitz E(2), Khalid N(3).  ;Infective endocarditis is an infectious disease of the endocardial surface of the heart, and it classifies as acute, subacute, or chronic depending upon the symptom’s onset and duration. The most common target is the valves, and rarely it can involve the mural endocardium. The incidence of IE has risen over the past few decades in the United States and across the Globe. The epidemiological trends have changed with Staphylococcus aureus being the predominant causative organism in the developed world. Despite optimal medical management, mortality remains unacceptably high. Patients not responsive to medical therapy or with certain complications may require surgical intervention and recognition of those factors is critical.  
Khalid N(1), Shlofmitz E(2), Ahmad SA(3).  ;Infective endocarditis occurs globally and is the infection of the endocardial surface of the native valve, prosthetic heart valve, or an implanted cardiac device such as a permanent pacemaker or a cardioverter-defibrillator. Over the past few decades, there has been a change in both the host and the pathogen. Staphylococcus aureus has surpassed Streptococcus as the most common etiologic pathogen worldwide and especially in the developed world given its common association with health-care contact and invasive procedures. Changes in the host include older and sicker patients who carry a high burden of comorbidities. Resistance to antibiotics is another challenge threatening healthcare worldwide and seems to be growing. Despite technological advances in diagnostic and therapeutic modalities, the overall mortality has not improved. Aortic valve infective endocarditis is a life-threatening disease associated with high mortality and morbidity. In this chapter, we will provide an overview of the infective endocarditis with a particular emphasis on the aortic valve endocarditis. The term native valve endocarditis denotes a cardiac infection that involves the leaflets of the valves, the endocardial surface, chordae tendinae, congenital defects, and anastomosis sites. Prosthetic valve endocarditis is defined by an infection involving the artificial valves, conduits, catheters, assist devices, pacemakers, defibrillators, or other artificial intracardiac structures.  
Shah SN, Sharma S(1).  ;Mitral stenosis (MS) is a form of valvular heart disease. Mitral stenosis is characterized by narrowing of the mitral valve orifice. Today, the most common cause of mitral stenosis is rheumatic fever, but the stenosis usually appears clinically relevant only after several decades.  
Echocardiographic predictors of first onset of atrial fibrillation in dogs with myxomatous mitral valve disease.  ;"BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) occurs in dogs with myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) as a consequence of left atrial (LA) dilatation, and it affects survival and quality of life. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the usefulness of echocardiography in predicting the first occurrence of AF in dogs with MMVD. ANIMALS: Forty-four client-owned dogs with MMVD, 22 dogs that developed AF, and 22 dogs that maintained sinus rhythm. METHODS: Retrospective observational study. Medical databases were reviewed for dogs that developed AF during the year after diagnosis of MMVD (AF group). The last echocardiographic examination obtained while still in sinus rhythm was used to derive selected variables. For each dog with AF, a control dog matched for body weight, class of heart failure, and LA dimension was selected. Echocardiographic results including LA volumes and LA speckle tracking echocardiography (STE)-derived variables were measured. RESULTS: Among the tested echocardiographic variables, only LA diameter (P = .03) and left ventricular internal diameter in diastole (P = .03) differed significantly between groups, whereas body weight-indexed variables of cardiac dimension as well as LA volumes and volume-derived functional variables were not different. Among the STE-derived variables, peak atrial longitudinal strain (PALS) results differed significantly between the AF group (23.8% ± 8.6%) and the control group (30.5% ± 9.6%; P = .03). A value of PALS ≤28% predicted AF occurrence with sensitivity and specificity of 0.80 and 0.65, respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Absolute cardiac diameters and LA STE (in particular, PALS) are useful echocardiographic predictors for the development of AF in dogs with MMVD.  "
Efficacy of oral torasemide in dogs with degenerative mitral valve disease and new onset congestive heart failure: The CARPODIEM study.  ;"BACKGROUND: Torasemide is a potent loop diuretic with potential to treat congestive heart failure (CHF) in dogs. OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the efficacy and safety of torasemide compared to furosemide in dogs with first occurrence of CHF caused by degenerative mitral valve disease (DMVD). ANIMALS: Three hundred and nineteen dogs with new onset CHF attributable to DMVD. METHODS: Double-blinded randomized noninferiority study of PO torasemide vs furosemide in addition to standard CHF treatment. The primary efficacy criterion was decreased pulmonary edema and cough and no worsening of dyspnea or exercise tolerance at day 14. Secondary endpoints included clinical response at day 84 and time to death, euthanasia, or premature study withdrawal for cardiac reasons. RESULTS: Torasemide q24h (n = 161) was noninferior to furosemide q12h (n = 158); percentage of dogs meeting primary efficacy criterion at day 14 was similar between groups (torasemide, 74.4% [95% confidence interval (CI), 66.8%-81.0%] vs. furosemide, 73.5% [95% CI, 65.7%-80.4%]; risk ratio [RR], 1.01; 95% CI, 0.89-1.15; P = .87). Efficacy at day 84 showed similar results (RR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.88-1.25; P = .6). Dogs receiving torasemide had a longer time to endpoint and were less than half as likely to experience death, euthanasia, or premature study withdrawal (hazard ratio, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.19-0.65; P = .001) than dogs receiving furosemide at any time during the study. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Torasemide was noninferior to furosemide as first line PO treatment for new onset CHF caused by DMVD. Torasemide significantly decreased risk of cardiac-related death or premature study withdrawal for cardiac reasons compared to furosemide.  "
ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction from Septic Emboli Secondary to Infective Endocarditis by Abiotrophia Defectiva.  ;This article showcases a young patient who presented with STEMI secondary to septic emboli due to endocarditis with Abiotrophia Defectiva in the setting of a congenital bicuspid aortic valve. We aim to discuss current considerations for STEMI in young individuals including embolism due to IE, especially in patients with known or suspected congenital heart valve disease.  
Heart valve mechanical prosthesis: The perfect match until it is not - A case report.  ;Primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), formerly known as idiopathic thrombocytopenia, is defined by a reduced platelet count <50x109 and is clinically manifested through signs and symptoms such as bleeding, ecchymosis and petechiae. Its coexistence with the implantation of the mechanical valves and the necessity of anticoagulation creates an additional risk of bleeding. Although mechanical valves are indispensable in prolonging and improving the quality of life in patients with valvular heart disease, in the context of an additional bleeding risk factor, their presence could represent a threat to life exposing the patient to major complications and leading to death. The purpose of this case report is to discuss the disadvantages and possible fatal complications of the association between mechanical valves and severe thrombocytopenia. A possible solution to these downsides could be found in the future search in regenerative medicine and tissue engineering of heart valves resulting in products that do not require anticoagulation and do not pose a threat to patients with thrombocytopenia.  
Fatal Prosthetic Valve Endocarditis Due to Aspergillus flavus in a Diabetic Patient.  ;Aspergillus endocarditis (AE) accounts for a-quarter of all fungal endocarditis, mainly in immunocompromised hosts prior to heart-valve surgery with high mortality, even with treatment. Herein, we report a rare case of AE in a diabetic 60-year-old woman with a history of redo mitral valve prosthesis suspecious of acute endocarditis. She underwent second redo surgical mitral valve replacement in combination with mechanical aortic valve replacement. Blood cultures were negative. The explanted valve and vegetation were subjected to identification. Grown colonies were identified as Aspergillus flavus, based on conventional and molecular methods. Despite the administration of liposomal amphotericin B and improvement in her general condition shortly after initiation of therapy, the patient passed away. As AE is a late consequence of redo prosthetic valve replacement, extended follow-up, early diagnosis, repeating valve-replacement surgeries, and timely selective antifungal treatments are warranted.  
Calcification of Cardiac Valves in Metabolic Bone Disease: An Updated Review of Clinical Studies.  ;Epidemiological and clinical data have suggested the existence of a relationship between cardiovascular diseases and metabolic bone disease. Several studies have demonstrated that heart valve calcification presents substantial similarities with that of bone. Literature data indicate that there are many active processes which promote osteogenesis and loss of mineralization inhibitors that lead to the deposition of extracellular matrix and proteins of bone tissue in cardiac valves. This review aimed to synthesize the available data in order to allow a better understanding of the relationship between osteoporosis or other metabolic bone diseases, such as primary hyperparathyroidism, and valvular calcification in humans. Electronic databases of Pubmed-Medline, Cochrane Library, and SCOPUS from inception to March 31, 2019 were searched. The full set of the articles potentially eligible were carefully assessed and reviewed. Finally, 23 studies were eligible and included in the systematic review. The majority of studies reported that osteoporosis and/or osteopenia were independent risk factors for valvular calcifications, even after adjusting for common cardiovascular risk factors. This suggests that this relationship is not only due to the presence of common cardiovascular risk factors but rather to underlying biological factors that connect them. Instead, regarding the association between primary hyperparathyroidism and valve calcification, conflicting data were found in the literature. To sum up, most of the literature data confirm that cardiac valve calcification processes are strongly influenced by alterations in bone metabolism. In particular, the patients with osteoporosis or primary hyperparathyroidism have an acceleration in the process of valvular calcification. Additional studies are needed to specifically address the mechanisms by which metabolic bone diseases could influence cardiac valve calcification.

Recent Developments in Cardiology Procedures for Adult Congenital Heart Disease: The Anesthesiologist's Perspective.  ;Many children born today with congenital heart disease can expect to live long into adulthood. Improvements in surgical technique and anesthetic and perioperative care have significantly increased the number of survivors. Unfortunately, as these patients progress through life they frequently require further interventions. Although surgical intervention may be required frequently, these patients can be managed in the cardiac catheterization or electrophysiology laboratory. Surgical correction of tetralogy of Fallot can leave patients with pulmonary valve dysfunction later in life. A percutaneous approach is now available for these patients, which can obviate the need for resternotomy. During deployment of the valve, anesthesiologists should be aware that compression of coronary arteries can occur. Adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) patients often require pacemaker/implantable cardioverter- defibrillator (ICD) insertion or ablation therapy. These patients may have altered cardiac anatomy, which can make endovascular procedures extremely challenging. Recent developments have made these procedures safer and more efficient. A number of congenital cardiac conditions can also be associated with orofacial abnormalities. ACHD patients, as a result, can present with challenging airways. The catheterization laboratory may not be the optimum environment for the anesthesiologist to manage a difficult airway. The requirement of transesophageal echocardiography for some cath eterization procedures needs to be considered when deciding on an airway management plan. Knowledge of the underlying cardiac anatomy and the planned procedure is advised when providing anesthesia for this complex patient group outside the theater setting.  
Staphylococcal endocarditis in a quadricuspid aortic valve following uncomplicated dengue infection: a case report.  ;BACKGROUND: Dengue fever is endemic and a leading health problem in Sri Lanka. Increased incidence of concurrent bacteremia in patients with dengue infection is a recognized complication. However, Staphylococcal endocarditis following dengue fever is uncommon. Quadricuspid aortic valve (QAV) is a rare congenital anomaly and few cases of infective endocarditis have been reported in QAV. CASE PRESENTATION: A 32-year-old Sri Lankan male presented to the National Hospital of Sri Lanka with recurrence of fever and acute left hemiplegia following an uncomplicated recovery of dengue fever. He was diagnosed to have Staphylococcal infective endocarditis of quadricuspid aortic valve, with septic emboli to brain and spleen. He was managed with intravenous vancomycin initially, however, due to inadequate response, intravenous linezolid was added. He developed rhabdomyolysis with very high creatine phosphokinase leading to acute kidney injury, which settled with the cessation of linezolid. The patient succumbed to his illness despite aggressive antimicrobial therapy and maximum supportive care while being assessed for aortic valve replacement. CONCLUSIONS: This case illustrates three clinical issues that a clinician should be aware of. Firstly, the possibility of a serious secondary bacterial infection as a cause for recurrence of fever following dengue infection. Secondly, this case highlights the importance of identifying QAV as a cause for complicated infective endocarditis of increased severity. The report also denotes the value of being vigilant of linezolid induced rhabdomyolysis which had a causal relationship with the commencement of the drug and its cessation.  
Transcatheter radiofrequency pulmonary valve perforation in newborns with pulmonary atresia/intact ventricular septum: Echocardiographic predictors of biventricular circulation.  ;OBJECTIVE: We report a single-institute experience of neonatal transvenous radiofrequency pulmonary valve perforation for pulmonary atresia/intact ventricular septum, with echocardiographic predictors of biventricular circulation. METHODS: Data were reviewed retrospectively for all neonates who underwent primary transvenous pulmonary valve perforation for pulmonary atresia/intact ventricular septum between January 2008 and November 2018 at our institution. We compared patients who need systemic-to-pulmonary shunt or ductal stenting with patients who did not need. RESULTS: During the study period, 31 patients with pulmonary atresia/intact ventricular septum underwent successful radiofrequency pulmonary valve perforation and balloon dilation of the pulmonary valve. There was no procedure-related mortality. Sixteen patients (52%) needed systemic-to-pulmonary shunt or ductal stenting after initial procedure. Among the survivors (follow-up time of 1 to 11.5 years), 15 patients had a biventricular circulation and 6 patients had 1 and 1⁄2 ventricular circulation. Two patients are awaiting for Fontan operation. Both the TV/MV annulus ratio (>0.85) and tricuspid valve z-score (>-1) were found to be a good predictor of a biventricular outcome in our cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous radiofrequency pulmonary valve perforation and balloon valvotomy is an effective and safe primary treatment strategy for neonates with pulmonary atresia/intact ventricular septum. Ductal stenting or systemic-to-pulmonary shunt may be required in the majority of patients who had smaller right heart components. Preselection of patients according to tricuspid valve z-score and TV/MV annulus ratio allows predicting biventricular circulation.  
Tricuspid Valve Annuloplasty Alters Leaflet Mechanics.  ;Tricuspid valve regurgitation is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Its most common treatment option, tricuspid valve annuloplasty, is not optimally effective in the long-term. Toward identifying the causes for annuloplasty's ineffectiveness, we have previously investigated the technique's impact on the tricuspid annulus and the right ventricular epicardium. In our current work, we are extending our analysis to the anterior tricuspid valve leaflet. To this end, we adopted our previous strategy of performing DeVega suture annuloplasty as an experimental methodology that allows us to externally control the degree of cinching during annuloplasty. Thus, in ten sheep we successively cinched the annulus and quantified changes to leaflet motion, dynamics, and strain in the beating heart by combining sonomicrometry with our well-established mechanical framework. We found that successive cinching of the valve enforced earlier coaptation and thus reduced leaflet range of motion. Additionally, leaflet angular velocity during opening and closing decreased. Finally, we found that leaflet strains were also reduced. Specifically, radial and areal strains decreased as a function of annular cinching. Our findings are critical as they suggest that suture annuloplasty alters the mechanics of the tricuspid valve leaflets which may disrupt their resident cells' mechanobiological equilibrium. Long-term, such disruption may stimulate tissue maladaptation which could contribute to annuloplasty's sub-optimal effectiveness. Additionally, our data suggest that the extent to which annuloplasty alters leaflet mechanics can be controlled via degree of cinching. Hence, our data may provide direct surgical guidelines.  
Genetic and In Vitro Inhibition of PCSK9 and Calcific Aortic Valve Stenosis.  ;"The authors investigated whether PCSK9 inhibition could represent a therapeutic strategy in calcific aortic valve stenosis (CAVS). A meta-analysis of 10 studies was performed to determine the impact of the PCSK9 R46L variant on CAVS, and the authors found that CAVS was less prevalent in carriers of this variant (odds ratio: 0.80 [95% confidence interval: 0.70 to 0.91]; p = 0.0011) compared with noncarriers. PCSK9 expression was higher in the aortic valves of patients CAVS compared with control patients. In human valve interstitials cells submitted to a pro-osteogenic medium, PCSK9 levels increased and a PCSK9 neutralizing antibody significantly reduced calcium accumulation.  "
Coexistence of Marfan-like Connective Tissue Disease with Morphologic Left Ventricular Non-Compaction.  ;We treated a man with co-incident Marfan-like connective tissue disease with morphologic left ventricular non-compaction (LVNC). He underwent valve-sparing aortic root replacement because of aortic root dilation at 43 years old. Pathological findings of the aorta revealed cystic medio-necrosis, consistent with Marfan syndrome. He developed congestive heart failure caused by LVNC at 47 years old. His daughter had scoliosis, and he had several physical characteristics suggestive of Marfan syndrome. We herein report a rare case of a patient who had Marfan-like connective disease with an LVNC appearance.  
Conservative treatment as a therapeutic option for penetrating aortic ulcer of the aortic arch in a patient with bicuspid aortic valve.  ;"Penetrating aortic ulcer (PAU) is ulceration of an aortic atherosclerotic plaque penetrating through the internal lamina into the media. PAU is a rare condition and occurs in 2% - 7% of acute aortic syndromes (AAS); however, the actual incidence is unknown because of asymptomatic patients. One may treat it conservatively as well as surgically. We present a case of a 54-year-old man, who was admitted to hospital due to the exaggeration of exertional chest pain and persistent headaches. During coronary angiography, the suspicion of PAU was raised. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography confirmed the diagnosis. Transesophageal echocardiography showed bicuspid aortic valve with minimal calcification, the dilated ascending aorta, large atherosclerotic plaques in the aortic arch with ulceration (thickness: 5.0 - 5.5mm, diameter: 5 - 6 mm, depth: 3 - 4 mm), without intramural hematoma. Conservative treatment was chosen with uneventful 2-year follow-up. Although surgical management is advocated for patients with PAU type A, we demonstrated that type A PAU can be successfully treated conservatively as well.  "
The Role of Novel Transcatheter Procedures in Patients With Congenital Heart Disease.  ;The development of percutaneous structural interventions in patients with acquired heart disease is happening at an exponential rate, and some of this technology is being used to treat patients with congenital heart disease. This review describes the pathophysiology of valvular abnormalities specific to congenital heart disease and discusses the application of structural procedures in this population. Although the overall experience has been encouraging, especially in high-risk patients, this article will highlight the reasons that a cautious approach to adoption of this technology is necessary in these patients.  
The chromogranin A-derived peptides catestatin and vasostatin in dogs with myxomatous mitral valve disease.  ;BACKGROUND: The protein chromogranin A (CgA) is stored and co-released with catecholamines from the stimulated adrenal glands. Increased plasma concentrations of CgA have been shown in people with heart disease. The aim of the study was to investigate whether plasma concentrations of the CgA-derived biologically active peptides catestatin and vasostatin were associated with the severity of myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) in dogs and to assess potential associations between these blood variables and dog characteristics, echocardiographic variables, heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP) and plasma N-terminal-proBNP (NT-proBNP) concentration. Sixty-seven privately owned dogs with or without MMVD were included. The dogs underwent physical examination, blood pressure measurement, blood sample collection, and echocardiographic examination. Plasma concentrations of catestatin and vasostatin were analyzed using radioimmunoassay. RESULTS: Catestatin concentration decreased with increasing left atrial and ventricular size (R2 ≤ 0.09, P ≤ 0.019), and increased with increasing systolic and diastolic blood pressures (R2 ≤ 0.08, P ≤ 0.038). Regression analyses showed no significant associations for vasostatin. No differences in plasma concentrations of catestatin or vasostatin were found between the disease severity groups used in the study. CONCLUSIONS: In the present dog population, the catestatin concentration showed weak negative associations with left atrial and ventricular sizes, both of which are known to increase with increasing severity of MMVD. Furthermore, the catestatin concentration showed weak positive associations with blood pressure.  
Mitral valve repair for infective endocarditis: Kobe experience.  ;OBJECTIVES: We retrospectively analyzed our experience of mitral valve repair for native mitral valve endocarditis in a single institution. METHODS: From January 1991 to October 2011, 171 consecutive patients underwent surgery for infective endocarditis. Of these, 147 (86%) had mitral valve repair. At the time of surgery, 98 patients had healed (group A) and 49 had active infective endocarditis (group B). Repair procedures included resection of all infected tissue and thick restricted post-infection tissue, leaflet and annulus reconstruction with treated autologous pericardium, chordal reconstruction with polytetrafluoroethylene sutures, and ring annuloplasty if necessary. Fifty-two (35%) patients required concomitant procedures. The study endpoints were overall survival, freedom from reoperation, and freedom from valve-related events. The median follow-up was 78 months. RESULTS: There was one hospital death (hospital mortality 0.7%). Survival at 10 years was 88.5% ± 3.5% with no significant difference between the two groups (p = 0.052). Early reoperation was required in 4 patients in group B due to persistent infection or procedure failure. Freedom from reoperation at 5 years was 99% ± 1.0% in group A and 89.6 ± 4.0% in group B (p = 0.024). Event-free survival at 10 years was 79.3% ± 4.8% (group A: 83.4% ± 5.9%, group B: 72.6% ± 6.9%, p = 0.010). CONCLUSIONS: Mitral valve repair was highly successful using autologous pericardium, chordal reconstruction, and ring annuloplasty if required. Long-term results were acceptable in terms survival, freedom from reoperation, and event-free survival. Mitral valve repair is recommended for mitral infective endocarditis in most patients.  
Phenotypical, Clinical, and Molecular Aspects of Adults and Children With Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia in Iberoamerica.  ;OBJECTIVE: Characterize homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) individuals from Iberoamerica. Approach and Results: In a cross-sectional retrospective evaluation 134 individuals with a HoFH phenotype, 71 adults (age 39.3±15.8 years, 38.0% males), and 63 children (age 8.8±4.0 years, 50.8% males) were studied. Genetic characterization was available in 129 (96%). The majority (91%) were true homozygotes (true HoFH, n=79, 43.0% children, 46.8% males) or compound heterozygotes (compound heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, n=39, 51.3% children, 46.2% males) with putative pathogenic variants in the LDLR. True HoFH due to LDLR variants had higher total (P=0.015) and LDL (low-density lipoprotein)-cholesterol (P=0.008) compared with compound heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. Children with true HoFH (n=34) tended to be diagnosed earlier (P=0.051) and had a greater frequency of xanthomas (P=0.016) than those with compound heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (n=20). Previous major cardiovascular events were present in 25 (48%) of 52 children (missing information in 2 cases), and in 43 (67%) of 64 adults with LDLR variants. Children who are true HoFH had higher frequency of major cardiovascular events (P=0.02), coronary heart (P=0.013), and aortic/supra-aortic valve diseases (P=0.022) than compound heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. In adults, no differences were observed in major cardiovascular events according to type of LDLR variant. From 118 subjects with LDLR variants, 76 (64%) had 2 likely pathogenic or pathogenic variants. In 89 subjects with 2 LDLR variants, those with at least one null allele were younger (P=0.003) and had a greater frequency of major cardiovascular events (P=0.038) occurring at an earlier age (P=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: There was a high frequency of cardiovascular disease even in children. Phenotype and cardiovascular complications were heterogeneous and associated with the type of molecular defect.  
Minocha PK(1), Phoon C(2).  ;Tricuspid atresia (TA) is a cyanotic congenital heart defect characterized by the complete agenesis of the tricuspid valve (TV). That is, there is no communication between the right atrium and ventricle. There are several subtypes of this disease with varied clinical presentations based on the degree of pulmonary blood flow. This lesion carries a very high mortality rate if there is no intervention during the first year of life.  
Shah SN, Gangwani MK(1), Oliver TI(2).  ;Mitral valve prolapse (MVP), also known as floppy mitral valve syndrome, systolic click-murmur syndrome, and billowing mitral leaflets, is a valvular heart disease disorder. It is a benign condition. In rare cases, it may present with sudden cardiac death, endocarditis or a stroke. The condition affects nearly 3% of the US population. The disorder produces symptoms as a result of a redundant and abnormally thickened mitral valve leaflet prolapsing into the left atrium during systole. Mitral valve prolapse is the most common pathology leading to  MVP is usually identified during a clinical exam on cardiac auscultation. Echocardiography confirms the diagnosis. This disorder is the most common cause of the non-ischemic mitral valve is mitral regurgitation in the US.   Symptomatic patients may need mitral valve repair.

Degree of left ventricular dilatation at end-diastole: Correlation and prognostic utility of quantitative volumes by 2D-echocardiography versus linear dimensions in patients with asymptomatic aortic regurgitation.  ;BACKGROUND: Guideline recommendations for aortic valve replacement (AVR) in asymptomatic patients with chronic aortic regurgitation (AR) have historically focused on linear dimensions without normalization for the body surface area (BSA). Values for grading the severity of end-diastolic volume dilatation by 2D echocardiography remain to be established. METHODS AND RESULTS: We retrospectively analyzed 543 consecutive asymptomatic patients with pure chronic moderate/severe AR (mean age 66 ± 17 years, 37.7% males). Applying the ASE/EACVI guidelines, BSA-indexed LV end-diastolic volume (LVEDVi) and indexed LV end-diastolic diameter (LVEDDi) were assessed. Then, we identified 192 patients with at least mild LV end-diastolic dilatation by volumetric or linear measurements. The outcome endpoint was the combination of cardiac death, hospitalization for acute heart failure or AVR during a median follow-up of 4.5 ± 3.6 years. Multivariable Cox regression analyses including age, LV ejection fraction (EF) and AR severity showed an independent prognostic value of the LVEDDi and LVEDVi (P < .001 and P < .01, respectively). Congruent severe LVEDDi and LVEDVi dilatation was associated with a higher event rate compared to discordant severe LV end-diastolic dilatation or nonsevere LV dilatation (P = .001) even after landmark analysis (P = .02). In patients with EF > 50%, only the LVEDVi showed and independent prognostic value (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: In a cohort of asymptomatic patients with AR, the presence of severe LV volume and diameter dilatation on the basis of the cutoff values proposed by current recommendations and normalized for BSA may be instrumental in the identification of patients at increased risk of clinical progression regardless of EF.  
Comparison of outcome of transcatheter aortic valve implantation in patients with advanced age: A systematic review and meta-analysis.  ;BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is an effective treatment to aortic stenosis in patients with advanced age. However, age is recognized as one of the most important risk factors. The aim of our study is to compare the outcome of TAVI between octogenarian patients and young patients. METHODS: Randomized controlled trials, cohort studies and propensity score matching studies will be included in our systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate clinical outcome in octogenarian patients who undergo TAVI. PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library and Web of Science will be searched using a comprehensive strategy. The related conference proceedings and reference lists of the included studies will also be checked to identify additional studies. Retrieved records, extract information and assess the risk of bias will be screened by two reviewers independently. STATA software will be used to conduct data synthesis. There is no requirement of ethical approval and informed consent. RESULTS: This study will eventually be published in a peer reviewed journal in the form of a scientific paper. CONCLUSION: This study will provide a comprehensive review of the available evidence for the treatment of aortic stenosis in octogenarian patients underwent TAVI. We hope it will provide a relatively comprehensive reference for clinical practice and future relevant clinical trials. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42020155189. STUDY PROTOCOL REGISTRY: The protocol has been registered in PROSPERO, which is an International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews. The registration number is CRD42020155189. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval and patient consent are not required as this study is a systematic review and meta-analysis.  
The association between carotid calcium on dental panoramic radiographs and coronary calcium score on chest computerized tomography.  ;OBJECTIVES: Coronary artery calcium measured by CT predicts future coronary events. Similarly, carotid artery calcium on dental panoramic radiographs has been associated with increased cardiovascular events. Pre-procedural assessment of candidates for valve replacement in our institution includes panoramic radiographs and chest tomography. We aimed to assess the association of carotid calcium on panoramic radiographs with coronary artery calcium on chest tomography. METHODS: Paired pre-procedural panoramic radiographs and chest tomography scans were done in 177 consecutive patients between October 2016 and October 2017. Carotid calcium was quantified using NIH's ImageJ. Coronary artery calcium was quantified by the Agatston score using Philips Intellispace portal, v. 8.0.1.20640. RESULTS: Carotid calcium maximal intensity, area and perimeter were higher among patients with high coronary artery calcium. Non-zero carotid calcium was found in half of patients with high coronary artery calcium, doubling prevalence of low coronary artery calcium. CONCLUSION: Carotid calcium identified in panoramic radiographs was associated with high coronary artery calcium. Awareness of carotid calcium recognized by dental practitioners in low-cost, low radiation and commonly done panoramic radiographs may be useful to identify patients at risk of coronary disease with potential future cardiovascular events.  
Evaluation of Transcatheter Pulmonary Valve Endocarditis by Dual-Energy Computed Tomography.  ;Transcatheter pulmonary valve implantation (TPVI) is now an established alternative to surgery in patients with congenital heart disease and dysfunctional right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) conduit. However, there is recognition of a higher incidence of infective endocarditis in the patients after TPVI. Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography is limited in the evaluation of prosthetic pulmonary valve endocarditis secondary to a metallic artifact and degenerative calcified conduit. Additionally, the anterior position of RVOT also limits evaluation by echocardiography. Conventional single-energy CTA can also be sub-optimal in evaluating prosthetic pulmonary valve stent frame due to streak artifacts from the metallic cage and poor contrast to noise ratio if higher kV is used for single-energy CTA to avoid metallic artifacts. Dual-energy CTA can overcome these limitations using reconstructed virtual monoenergetic and iodine-only images for metal artifact reduction and improve intra-stent luminal visualization. Reconstructed iodine perfusion maps may also help differentiate vegetation from a thrombus. In this case report, we discuss the diagnostic utility of dual-energy cardiac CT in the evaluation of endocarditis after TPVI and discuss the imaging protocol.  
Melody Valve Endocarditis Due to Rothia dentocariosa: A Diagnostic Challenge.  ;Recently, there have been several advances in the field of adult congenital heart disease, such as the percutaneous pulmonic valve implantation (PPVI) to treat right ventricular outflow obstruction. Complications from this technique are seldom but essential to understand. We present a case of a 37-year-old Caucasian male with complicated congenital heart disease, including prior Melody valve implantation, who presented to our hospital with recurrent episodes of pneumonia of two months duration. He was diagnosed with prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) from an unusual organism, Rothia dentocariosa. He eventually underwent surgical replacement of the infected valve. Our report is the first case of Melody valve endocarditis due to Rothia dentocariosa reported from the United States.  
Usefulness of FRAIL Scale in Heart Valve Diseases.  ;"BACKGROUND: The frailty syndrome is a serious health problem for an aging population. The occurrence of frailty in the group of symptomatic patients undergoing heart valve surgery may have additional clinical implications. The predictive ability of the FRAIL scale in patients undergoing heart valve surgery during a 30-day follow-up has not yet been described. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective study was conducted on a group of consecutive patients with hemodynamically significant valve disease (aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation, mitral stenosis and mitral regurgitation) that underwent elective valve surgery in 2014-2019. The primary endpoint was 30-day mortality. Univariate analysis, followed by multivariate regression analysis, was performed. RESULTS: The study group included 672 consecutive patients (aortic valve stenosis, aortic regurgitation, mitral stenosis and mitral regurgitation) who underwent replacement or repair of the valve. Twenty-five patients died during the 30-day follow-up. At multivariate analysis, FRAIL scale result (OR 2.802; 95% CI 1.275-6.157; p=0.01) and red cell distribution width (RDW) (OR 1.810; 95% CI 1.181-2.775; p=0.006) remained independent predictors of the primary endpoint. CONCLUSION: The presented study showed the predictive ability of the FRAIL scale result in patients undergoing heart valve surgery for 30-day mortality.  "

In-Hospital Outcomes of Left Ventricular Assist Device Implantation and Concomitant Valvular Surgery.  ;Valvular heart disease is common among left ventricular assist device (LVAD) recipients. However, its management at the time of LVAD implantation remains controversial. Patients who underwent LVAD implantation and concomitant aortic (AVR), mitral (MVR), or tricuspid valve (TVR) repair or replacement from 2010 to 2017 were identified using the national inpatient sample. End points were in-hospital outcomes, length of stay, and cost. Procedure-related complications were identified via ICD-9 and ICD-10 coding and analysis was performed via mixed effect models. A total of 25,171 weighted adults underwent LVAD implantation without valvular surgery, 1,329 had isolated TVR, 1,021 AVR, 377 MVR, and 615 had combined valvular surgery (411 had TVR + AVR, 115 TVR + MVR, 62 AVR + MVR, 25 AVR + MVR + TVR). During the study period, rates of AVR decreased and combined valvular surgeries increased. Patients who underwent TVR or combined valvular surgery had overall higher burden of co-morbidities than LVAD recipients with or without other valvular procedures. Postoperative bleeding was higher with AVR whereas acute kidney injury requiring dialysis was higher with TVR or combined valvular surgery. In-hospital mortality was higher with AVR, MVR, or combined surgery without differences in the rates of stroke. Length of stay did not differ significantly among groups but cost of hospitalization and nonroutine discharge rates were higher for cases of TVR and combined surgery. Approximately 1 in 9 LVAD recipients underwent concomitant valvular surgery and TVR was the most frequently performed procedure. In-hospital mortality and cost were lower among those who did not undergo valvular surgery.  
Hemodynamics inside the neo- and native sinus after TAVR: Effects of implant depth and cardiac output on flow field and coronary flow.  ;Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has emerged as a widely used therapy for aortic valve diseases. With TAVR, flow hemodynamics may change leading to areas of flow stagnation prone to thrombosis risk. The neo-sinus, created by introducing a prosthesis inside the diseased native valve, may prompt leaflet thrombosis due to areas of flow stasis. This study attempted to understand the effect of different prosthesis implant depths on the flow field within the neo- and native sinus and on the coronary perfusion. Experiments were performed inside an in vitro pulse duplicator producing physiological conditions according to ISO 5840-1:2015 standard. Flow fields were obtained for two cardiac outputs (CO) using particle image velocimetry (PIV). Washout was calculated as a measure of flow stasis. The two main results are: a lower implant position and a lower CO/frequency led to better native sinus washout, but worsened neo-sinus washout. In contrast, a higher implant position led to higher coronary flow (for higher CO/frequency). No significant effect of implant depth on coronary flow was observed for lower CO/frequency. In summary, a higher implant position using this self-expanding prosthesis is associated with reduced neo-sinus flow stasis. Hereby, washout of the native sinus, as well as coronary flow, are dependent on cardiac output.  
Heart Failure With Reduced Ejection Fraction: A Review.  ;IMPORTANCE: Worldwide, the burden of heart failure has increased to an estimated 23 million people, and approximately 50% of cases are HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). OBSERVATIONS: Heart failure is a clinical syndrome characterized by dyspnea or exertional limitation due to impairment of ventricular filling or ejection of blood or both. HFrEF occurs when the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is 40% or less and is accompanied by progressive left ventricular dilatation and adverse cardiac remodeling. Assessment for heart failure begins with obtaining a medical history and physical examination. Also central to diagnosis are elevated natriuretic peptides above age- and context-specific thresholds and identification of left ventricular systolic dysfunction with LVEF of 40% or less as measured by echocardiography. Treatment strategies include the use of diuretics to relieve symptoms and application of an expanding armamentarium of disease-modifying drug and device therapies. Unless there are specific contraindications, patients with HFrEF should be treated with a β-blocker and one of an angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, or angiotensin receptor blocker as foundational therapy, with addition of a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist in patients with persistent symptoms. Ivabradine and hydralazine/isosorbide dinitrate also have a role in the care of certain patients with HFrEF. More recently, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have further improved disease outcomes, significantly reducing cardiovascular and all-cause mortality irrespective of diabetes status, and vericiguat, a soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator, reduces heart failure hospitalization in high-risk patients with HFrEF. Device therapies may be beneficial in specific subpopulations, such as cardiac resynchronization therapy in patients with interventricular dyssynchrony, transcatheter mitral valve repair in patients with severe secondary mitral regurgitation, and implantable cardiac defibrillators in patients with more severe left ventricular dysfunction particularly of ischemic etiology. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: HFrEF is a major public health concern with substantial morbidity and mortality. The management of HFrEF has seen significant scientific breakthrough in recent decades, and the ability to alter the natural history of the disease has never been better. Recent developments include SGLT2 inhibitors, vericiguat, and transcatheter mitral valve repair, all of which incrementally improve prognosis beyond foundational neurohormonal therapies. Disease morbidity and mortality remain high, with a 5-year survival rate of 25% after hospitalization for HFrEF.  
Congenitally corrected transposition and mitral atresia complicated by restrictive atrial septum.  ;Congenitally corrected transposition (ccTGA), also known as L-transposition of the great arteries (L-TGA), is a rare cardiac malformation accounting for approximately 0.05% of congenital heart disease, characterized by ventricular inversion, discordant ventriculo-arterial connections with a normal visceroatrial relationship. It was first described by Baron Rokitansky in 1875, and prenatal sonographic diagnosis can be difficult. Symptomatology and clinical presentation of this malformation are related to the associated intracardiac defects. We report a rare case of severe, complex cardiac disease: prenatally diagnosed ccTGA with atrial restriction, mitral atresia, Ebsteinoid tricuspid valve, and severe pulmonary valve stenosis, who subsequently developed left pulmonary vein stenosis.  
Indications and predictors for pacemaker implantation after isolated aortic valve replacement with bioprostheses: the CAREAVR study.  ;OBJECTIVES: We sought to study the indications, long-term occurrence, and predictors of permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI) after isolated surgical aortic valve replacement with bioprostheses. METHODS: The CAREAVR study included 704 patients (385 females, 54.7%) without a preoperative PPI (mean ± standard deviation age 75 ± 7 years) undergoing isolated surgical aortic valve replacement at 4 Finnish hospitals between 2002 and 2014. Data were extracted from electronic patient records. RESULTS: The follow-up was median 4.7 years (range 1 day to 12.3 years). Altogether 56 patients received PPI postoperatively, with the median 507 days from the operation (range 6 days to 10.0 years). The PPI indications were atrioventricular block (31 patients, 55%) and sick sinus syndrome (21 patients, 37.5%). For 4 patients, the PPI indication remained unknown. A competing risks regression analysis (Fine-Gray method), adjusted with age, sex, diabetes, coronary artery disease, preoperative atrial fibrillation (AF), left ventricular ejection fraction, New York Heart Association class, AF at discharge and urgency of operation, was used to assess risk factors for PPI. Only AF at discharge (subdistribution hazard ratio 4.34, 95% confidence interval 2.34-8.03) was a predictor for a PPI. CONCLUSIONS: Though atrioventricular block is the major indication for PPI after surgical aortic valve replacement, >30% of PPIs are implanted due to sick sinus syndrome during both short-term follow-up and long-term follow-up. Postoperative AF versus sinus rhythm conveys >4-fold risk of PPI. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02626871.  
The 'wait for symptoms' strategy in asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis.  ;Calcific aortic stenosis is a prevalent and worrisome healthcare problem. The therapeutic approach in asymptomatic aortic stenosis is not well established. We argue that the natural history of this disease is based on old incomplete studies with many limitations. Likewise, studies suggesting that replacement, either surgical or percutaneous, improves prognosis in asymptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis have important drawbacks and do not support this strategy as the treatment of choice. Despite the lack of evidence, some groups recommend early valve replacement in patients with severe asymptomatic aortic stenosis. There are five ongoing randomised trials which will shed light on this topic. Our conclusion is that unless a randomised study changes the evidence, valve replacement cannot be recommended in asymptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis.  
Cholesterol induced heart valve inflammation and injury: efficacy of cholesterol lowering treatment.  ;BACKGROUND: Heart valves often undergo a degenerative process leading to mechanical dysfunction that requires valve replacement. This process has been compared with atherosclerosis because of shared pathology and risk factors. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the role of inflammation triggered by cholesterol infiltration and cholesterol crystals formation causing mechanical and biochemical injury in heart valves. METHODS: Human and atherosclerotic rabbit heart valves were evaluated. New Zealand White male rabbits were fed an enriched cholesterol diet alone or with simvastatin and ezetimibe simultaneous or after 6 months of initiating cholesterol diet. Inflammation was measured using C-reactive protein (CRP) and RAM 11 of tissue macrophage content. Cholesterol crystal presence and content in valves was evaluated using scanning electron microscopy. RESULTS: Cholesterol diet alone induced cholesterol infiltration of valves with associated increased inflammation. Tissue cholesterol, CRP levels and RAM 11 were significantly lower in simvastatin and ezetimibe rabbit groups compared with cholesterol diet alone. However, the treatment was effective only when initiated with a cholesterol diet but not after lipid infiltration in valves. Aortic valve cholesterol content was significantly greater than all other cardiac valves. Extensive amounts of cholesterol crystals were noted in rabbit valves on cholesterol diet and in diseased human valves. CONCLUSIONS: Prevention of valve infiltration with cholesterol and reduced inflammation by simvastatin and ezetimibe was effective only when given during the initiation of high cholesterol diet but was not effective when given following infiltration of cholesterol into the valve matrix.  
Rapid deployment valves versus conventional tissue valves for aortic valve replacement.  ;OBJECTIVES: Rapid deployment valves have been developed as a means to adjust for limitations in transcatheter aortic valve replacement and surgical aortic valve replacement for the management of aortic valve disease. To date, many studies have shown that although rapid deployment valves facilitate a shorter surgical aortic valve replacement, they offer no clinical benefit. The purpose of this study was to compare the outcomes of rapid deployment valves with conventional surgical aortic valve replacement. METHODS: This study was a retrospective review of all patients undergoing tissue aortic valve replacement at a single center. The majority of patients were men and aged more than 60 years. Patients were categorized into 2 groups: (1) rapid deployment valves and (2) conventional sutured valve. Inverse probability treatment weighting method was used to create a cohort of patients with similar baseline characteristics. Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests were used to determine if there were statistically significant differences in outcomes. Primary outcome was all-cause mortality at 30 days, 1 year, and 5 years. RESULTS: A total of 2237 patients made up the study population from 2013 to 2019. After inverse probability treatment weighting, there were 295 patients in each group. Shorter cardiopulmonary bypass and crossclamp times were found with the rapid deployment valves. No statistically significant difference was found in the primary and secondary outcomes. There was a significant difference in the rate of permanent pacemaker insertion with a 7% pacemaker rate in the rapid deployment valve group (P < .009). CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that rapid deployment valves offer no benefit in straightforward aortic valve replacement, and further study will help identify which patient population the valve is suited for.  
Severe Cardiopulmonary Disease in a Parturient With Noonan Syndrome.  ;Noonan syndrome is a relatively common genetic disorder and the second most common cause of congenital heart disease after trisomy 21. The spectrum of cardiac anomalies in Noonan syndrome typically involves pulmonary valve stenosis occasionally in conjunction with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Mitral valve involvement is a rare finding in Noonan syndrome and is most commonly associated with either mitral valve prolapse or abnormal valvular insertion causing left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Patients with Noonan syndrome typically have preserved fertility and, given the success of cardiac surgery and medical management of heart failure in this population, are beginning to present more commonly as parturients in adulthood. Maternal physiologic changes during pregnancy introduce an added complexity to hemodynamic management and anesthetic considerations during labor and delivery. In this article, we present a case of a patient with Noonan syndrome with severe mitral stenosis, pulmonary valve insufficiency, and severe restrictive and obstructive pulmonary disease who presented preterm for delivery due to increased dyspnea at rest. Here we review the pathophysiology behind Noonan syndrome and peripartum management strategies in a patient with severe combined cardiac and pulmonary disease.

Thymolipoma Association with Myasthenia Gravis: Case Report.  ;BACKGROUND Thymolipoma, which was described initially by Hall in 1949, is an uncommon benign thymic tumor that represents around 9% of all thymic tumors. The incidence of thymolipoma is around 0.12 out of 100 000 cases per year, with a higher incidence in the younger age population. Thymolipoma incidence has been linked to different autoimmune diseases, including myasthenia gravis, in half of the reported cases. There are 34 reported cases in the literatures documenting such a relationship between thymolipoma and myasthenia gravis. The exact pathogenesis is unclear. However, some genetic findings revealed the presence of myoid cells, which might play a vital role in this association. CASE REPORT A 56-years-old female known to have myasthenia gravis presented to the Emergency Department with acute congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and stroke secondary to infected vegetation from the mitral valve. The patient underwent a semi-urgent mitral valve replacement surgery treating her cardiac presentation along with an extended thymectomy to control her myasthenia gravis disease. The final histopathological assessment of the removed thymus revealed a thymolipoma pathology. CONCLUSIONS The possibility of thymolipoma as an anterior mediastinal mass should be kept in mind when dealing with an older age group of myasthenia gravis patients on steroids. Concomitant heart surgery and thymectomy are feasible, and extended thymectomy is the treatment of choice for thymolipoma in myasthenia gravis patients with a better complete remission rate after resection. However, further comparative studies are needed for a more reliable conclusion of the postoperative myasthenia gravis response after resection.  
Clinical burden associated with postsurgical complications in major cardiac surgeries in Asia-Oceania countries: A systematic review and meta-analysis.  ;"BACKGROUND: Evidence on the burden of postsurgical complications is mainly from studies in western countries, and little is highlighted in the Asia-Oceania region. This study aimed to identify and compare the burden of postsurgical complications in major cardiac surgeries in Asia-Oceania countries. METHODS: A systematic search was performed in PubMed, Embase, and CENTRAL between January 2000 and July 2018. Inclusion criteria were: (a) observational studies or randomized control trials; (b) studied in coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and/or heart valve procedures; (c) measured postsurgical clinical outcomes; and (d) conducted in Asia-Oceania countries. Pooled effects were calculated using a random-effects model. RESULTS: Of the 6032 articles screened, 472 studies with a total of 614 161 patients met the inclusion criteria. The pooled incidences (95% confidence interval) of hospital mortality and 30-day mortality were similar at 2.38% (2.16%-2.59%) and 2.33% (2.16%-2.50%), respectively. Length of stay (LOS) was 14.07 days (13.44-14.71 days). The incidence for atrial fibrillation (AF) and stroke/cerebrovascular accident (CVA) was 17.49% (15.99%-18.99%) and 1.64% (1.51%-1.78%), respectively. Below outcomes tended to be better in studies on CABG compared to heart valve procedures, including the incidence of hospital mortality (1.97%[1.75%-2.18%] vs 3.97% [3.29%-4.65%]), AF (16.47% [14.85%-18.10%] vs 21.98% [17.41%-26.54%]), stoke/CVA (1.51% [1n 37%-1.65%] vs 2.55% [2.07%-3.04%]), and mean LOS (days) (13.08 [12.51-13.65] vs 19.58 [16.72-22.45]). Similarly, all postsurgical complications tended to be higher in studies involving high-risk patients vs non-high-risk patients. CONCLUSIONS: There are opportunities to improve clinical outcomes of patients with high surgical risks and those undertaking heart valve procedures, as they tend to have poorer survival and higher risk in developing postsurgical complications.

Orbital atherectomy for treating calcified iliac artery disease to enable large bore device delivery: A case series report.  ;The current standard of care for the treatment of flow-limiting calcific iliac artery disease is balloon angioplasty and subsequent stent placement. However, the presence of calcified lesions may prevent adequate stent expansion or impede the delivery of large bore devices, such as those for transcatheter aortic valve replacement or endovascular aneurysm repair implants. Plaque modification through vessel preparation with orbital atherectomy may enable stent expansion and subsequent proper large device delivery with low rates of procedural complications. A retrospective, single center, case series of 13 subjects treated with orbital atherectomy in iliac arteries to enable large bore device delivery was conducted. Patients were selected for treatment based on iliac artery disease or inability to deliver devices. The procedural complication rate was defined as the composite of flow-limiting dissection, perforation, slow flow, vessel closure, spasm, embolism, and thrombosis. Technical success was assessed as angiographic luminal gain and subsequent successful delivery of large bore devices through the treatment area, as well as freedom from procedural complications. Orbital atherectomy vessel preparation of severely calcified iliac artery lesions resulted in adequate stent expansion safely and enabled delivery of rigid/large profile devices. Further studies are warranted to evaluate patient selection criteria, as well as long-term efficacy and safety rates of orbital atherectomy in the iliac artery.  
Ubiquinol supplementation in elderly patients undergoing aortic valve replacement: biochemical and clinical aspects.  ;"Epidemiological data show a rise in the mean age of patients affected by heart disease undergoing cardiac surgery. Senescent myocardium reduces the tolerance to ischemic stress and there are indications about age-associated deficit in post-operative cardiac performance. Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), and more specifically its reduced form ubiquinol (QH), improve several conditions related to bioenergetic deficit or increased exposure to oxidative stress. This trial (Eudra-CT 2009-015826-13) evaluated the clinical and biochemical effects of ubiquinol in 50 elderly patients affected by severe aortic stenosis undergoing aortic valve replacement and randomized to either placebo or 400 mg/day ubiquinol from 7 days before to 5 days after surgery. Plasma and cardiac tissue CoQ10 levels and oxidative status, circulating troponin I, CK-MB (primary endpoints), IL-6 and S100B were assessed. Moreover, main cardiac adverse effects, NYHA class, contractility and myocardial hypertrophy (secondary endpoints) were evaluated during a 6-month follow-up visit. Ubiquinol treatment counteracted the post-operative plasma CoQ10 decline (p<0.0001) and oxidation (p=0.038) and curbed the post-operative increase in troponin I (QH, 1.90 [1.47-2.48] ng/dL; placebo, 4.03 [2.45-6.63] ng/dL; p=0.007) related to cardiac surgery. Moreover, ubiquinol prevented the adverse outcomes that might have been associated with defective left ventricular ejection fraction recovery in elderly patients.  "
Longitudinal Variation in Presence and Severity of Cardiac Valve Regurgitation in Healthy Children.  ;BACKGROUND: The goal of this study was to document the frequency and longitudinal variation in the presence and severity of echocardiographically documented valvular regurgitation (VR) in healthy children free of evidence of heart disease. We hypothesized that significant variation is common, and our specific aim was to determine change in prevalence and severity of VR in children free of heart disease. METHODS: The presence of VR was documented on each of the four valves, and the severity of regurgitation was assessed as the body surface area (BSA)-adjusted width of the vena contracta on each of two sequential echocardiograms in healthy children free of clinical and echocardiographic evidence of heart disease. RESULTS: We included 200 children ages 10.0 ± 4.5 years, BSA = 1.2 ± 0.43 m2, at the first exam and 12.8 ± 4.9 years, BSA = 1.42 ± 0.44 m2, at the second exam. Frequency of VR was similar on the two exams (tricuspid = 61.5% vs 57.0%, pulmonary = 55.5 vs 57.5%, mitral = 14.5% vs 16.0%, aortic = 3.0 vs 3.5%). The frequency of new appearance was similar to the frequency of resolution of VR for all four valves. For instances where the severity of VR was classified as trace versus mild, the frequency of change from mild to trace between the two exams was similar to the frequency of change from trace to mild. CONCLUSIONS: In healthy children with no evidence of heart disease, there is substantial temporal variation in the presence and severity of tricuspid and pulmonary VR. The prevalence of mitral and aortic VR is lower in healthy children, but temporal variation is also noted for these valves. The finding of new-onset echocardiographic trace or mild VR cannot be assumed to represent incident valve pathology.  
Procedural and mid-term outcomes of coronary protection during transcatheter aortic valve replacement in patients at-risk of coronary occlusion: Insight from a single-centre retrospective analysis.  ;"BACKGROUND: Detailed procedural analysis and long-term data is limited for coronary protection (CP) during transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) for patients with high anatomical risk for coronary occlusion (CO). We aim to assess the procedural and mid-term outcomes of CP during TAVR. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed patients who underwent TAVR at Henry Ford Hospital, USA from January 2015 to August 2019 and identified those considered at risk of CO and underwent pre-emptive CP with or without subsequent ""chimney"" stenting (i.e. coronary stenting with intentional protrusion into the aorta). Procedural features, immediate and mid-term clinical outcomes were reviewed. RESULTS: Twenty-five out of 1166 (2.1%) patients underwent TAVR with CP, including 10 (40%) valve-in-valve procedures. Twenty-eight coronary arteries (Left: n = 11, Right: n = 11; Left + Right: n = 3) were protected. Eleven coronaries (39.3%) were electively ""chimney""-stented due to angiographic evidence of coronary impingement (63.6%), tactile resistance while withdrawing stent (27.3%) and electrocardiogram change (9.1%). Twenty-four patients (24/25, 96%) had successful TAVR without CO. Procedure-related complications included stent-balloon entrapment (n = 1), stent entrapment (n = 1) and occlusive distal stent edge dissection (n = 1). After a mean follow-up of 19.1 months, there was 1 cardiac death but no target vessel re-intervention or myocardial infarction. CONCLUSIONS: Our study found that angiographic evidence of coronary impingement (63.6%) was the most common reason for stent deployment during TAVR with CP. The mid-term clinical outcome of CP with TAVR was favorable.  "
Improvement of the Prognosis Assessment of Severe Tricuspid Regurgitation by the Use of a Five-Grade Classification of Severity.  ;"It is well known that some patients present with ""more than severe"" tricuspid regurgitation (TR). We aimed to assess the prognosis of these very severe TR patients. We defined very severe TR using 3 simple echocardiographic parameters: a coaptation gap≥10mm, a laminar TR flow and a systolic reversal of the hepatic vein flow. We included 259 consecutive patients (76 ± 13 years; 46% men) with moderate-to-severe TR (n = 114) and severe TR (n = 145). The primary end point was the combination of hospitalisation for right heart failure (RHF) and cardiovascular mortality. Median follow-up was 24(7 to 47) months. In patients with severe TR, 52 (36%) met the definition of very severe TR. These patients were younger, had more history of RHF and were more frequently treated with loop diuretics than those with moderate-to-severe TR (all p < 0.001). Four-year event-free survival rates were 68 ± 5%, for moderate-to-severe TR, 48 ± 6% for severe TR and only 35 ± 7% for very-severe TR (p < 0.001). On multivariable analysis, after adjustment for outcome predictors including age, comorbidity, RHF, TR etiology, left and right ventricular dysfunction, and tricuspid valve surgery, patients with very severe TR had a worsened prognosis than those with moderate-to-severe TR (Adjusted Hazard Ratio [95% Confidence Interval] = 2.43 [1.18 to 5.53]; p = 0.002) and than those with severe TR (Adjusted Hazard Ratio [95% Confidence Interval] = 2.23 [1.06 to 5.56]; p = 0.015). In conclusion, very severe TR is frequent in patients with severe TR, corresponds to a more advanced stage of the disease and is associated with poor outcomes. Therefore, the use of a 5-grade classification of TR severity is justified in routine clinical practice. (ID-RCB: 2017-A03233-50).  "
Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy: Is a 'Cure' Coming . . . Or Is It Already Here?  ;DOI: 10.1016/j.amjmed.2020.03.015 PMID: 32741446 [Indexed for MEDLINE]  
Transcatheter tricuspid valve repair in the setting of heart failure with preserved or reduced left ventricular ejection fraction.  ;AIMS: Severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR) impairs prognosis in patients with left-sided heart failure (HF) with preserved (≥50%, HFpEF) and reduced ejection fraction (<50%, HFrEF). Transcatheter tricuspid valve edge-to-edge repair (TTVR) potentially improves prognosis among patients with severe TR. We sought to assess the impact of left-sided HF types on outcomes of TTVR. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this retrospective study, 71 HFpEF and 40 HFrEF patients, defined according to the European Society of Cardiology criteria, with isolated TR treated by TTVR in two tertiary care centres between 2016 and 2019 were analysed. The primary outcome was a composite outcome of all-cause mortality and HF hospitalization at 12 months [median follow-up 238 (interquartile range 175-365) days]. Additionally, a propensity score matching with a conservatively treated cohort of 914 patients with severe TR was performed. Procedural success did not differ between HFpEF (mean age 75.9 ± 9.3 years) or HFrEF (mean age 74.7 ± 9.1 years) patients (86% vs. 78%, P = 0.299). The primary endpoint occurred more frequently in patients with HFrEF as compared to HFpEF (50% vs. 30%, P = 0.016). Procedural success was associated with a reduced occurrence of the primary endpoint among patients with HFpEF (P < 0.001) but not HFrEF (P = 0.813), while both groups showed improvement in New York Heart Association functional class (both P < 0.001). After matching for age, EuroSCORE II, presence of a right ventricular lead and systolic pulmonary artery pressure, successful TTVR was associated with lower mortality as compared to conservative therapy in HFpEF patients (P = 0.020), but not in HFrEF patients (P = 0.274). CONCLUSION: Transcatheter tricuspid valve edge-to-edge repair might be a treatment option in patients with severe TR and HFpEF compared to conservative therapy.  
Robotic trans-mitral septal myectomy and papillary muscle reorientation for HOCM combined with or without mitral valve repair: Technical aspects - How we do it.  ;Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) is one of the more common genetic disorders. The pathophysiology and natural history of the disease have been well studied. Left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) and systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the anterior mitral leaflet can result in sudden cardiac death, progressive heart failure and arrythmias. Surgical septal myectomy for HOCM is the standard of care and is routinely performed through a median sternotomy. Septal myectomy has also been performed using the trans-atrial, trans-mitral approach either directly or with robotic assistance. In cases with severe LVOT obstruction in the setting of only mild to moderate proximal septal hypertrophy, intrinsic problems with the mitral valve contribute. Typically, these are hypermobile papillary muscles and or excessive height of the anterior mitral leaflet. Combining septal myectomy with reorientation of hypermobile anteriorly positioned papillary muscles has shown to prevent SAM and thereby additionally decrease the subvalvular aortic outflow obstruction. Our extensive experience in both septal myectomy and robotic mitral valve repair has given us a different perspective in approaching the primary mitral regurgitation in HOCM patients where a combined septal myectomy, papillary muscle reorientation and complex mitral valve repair has been safely performed using the less invasive robotic-assisted approach.Our objective here is to discuss the technical aspects of the procedure.  
Effect of General Anesthesia on Cardiac Magnetic Resonance-Derived Cardiac Function in Repaired Tetralogy of Fallot.  ;Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR)-derived ejection fraction (EF) predicts adverse outcomes in repaired tetralogy of Fallot (rTOF) and drives timing of pulmonary valve replacement. Certain patient populations require sedation for successful CMR image acquisition. General anesthesia (GA) has been shown to depress EF and heart rate (HR) in animal models, however, its effect on congenital heart disease is unknown. A retrospective review was conducted of all CMR patients referred with rTOF between January 2011 and May 2019. The cohort was separated into GA and non-GA groups. Propensity score matching (PSM) adjusted for selection bias. A kernel matching algorithm was used to match subjects and the differences in mean treatment effect on the treated were computed for left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) EF, HR, and cardiac index (CI). 143 patients met criteria, 37 patients under GA (mean age 15 years, range 2-45, 59% male), and 106 patients without GA (mean age 21 years, range 10-53, 50% male). Unmatched analysis showed significant depression of LV EF (50 vs. 57%, p < 0.001) and RV EF (42 vs. 48%, p < 0.001) in the GA group compared to the non-GA group. There was no significant difference in HR or CI. After matching and PSM adjustment, the GA group had a significant decrease in LV EF (49 vs. 56%, p < 0.001), RV EF (41 vs. 48%, p < 0.001), CI (2728 vs. 3701 ml/min/m2, p < 0.001), and HR (72 vs. 79 bpm, p = 0.04). General anesthesia with sevoflurane results in depressed CMR-derived EF.  
Surgical left atrial appendage occlusion in patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing mechanical heart valve replacement.  ;"BACKGROUND: Surgical left atrial appendage occlusion (SLAAO) may be associated with a lower risk of thromboembolism in patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing cardiac surgery. However, evidence regarding the effectiveness of SLAAO in patients undergoing mechanical heart valve replacement (MHVR) is lacking. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the association between SLAAO and the cardiovascular outcomes in patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing MHVR. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data for 497 patients with atrial fibrillation; 27.6% of the patients underwent SLAAO, and the remainder of the patients did not (No-SLAAO group). The primary outcome was a composite of ischemic stroke, systemic embolism, and all-cause mortality. Cumulative event-free survival rates were estimated using Kaplan-Meier curves, and we performed multivariate Cox analyses to evaluate the association between SLAAO and outcomes. We used one-to-one propensity score matching to balance patients' baseline characteristics, and analyzed 120 matching pairs. RESULTS: Five patients died within 30 days postoperatively, and there were no significant differences between the two groups regarding in-hospital complications (all P > 0.05). After a median follow-up of 14 months, 14 primary events occurred. Kaplan-Meier curves showed no difference in the cumulative incidence of freedom from the primary outcome (log-rank P = 0.830), hemorrhagic events (log-rank P = 0.870), and the secondary outcome (log-rank P = 0.730), between the two groups. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analysis showed no association between SLAAO and any outcome (all P > 0.05). After propensity score matching, cardiopulmonary bypass time and aortic cross-clamp time, and the postoperative length of stay were significantly longer in the SLAAO group (all P < 0.05); results were similar to the unadjusted analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Concomitant SLAAO and MHVR was associated with longer length of stay, and cardiopulmonary bypass time and aortic cross-clamp time, but was not associated with additional protective effects against thromboembolic events and mortality during the 14-month follow-up.

Physical Functioning, Mental Health, and Quality of Life in Different Congenital Heart Defects: Comparative Analysis in 3538 Patients From 15 Countries.  ;"BACKGROUND: We compared physical functioning, mental health, and quality of life (QoL) of patients with different subtypes of congenital heart disease (CHD) in a large international sample and investigated the role of functional class in explaining the variance in outcomes across heart defects. METHODS: In the cross-sectional Assessment of Patterns of Patient-Reported Outcome in Adults with Congenital Heart Disease-International Study (APPROACH-IS), we enrolled 4028 adult patients with CHD from 15 countries. Diagnostic groups with at least 50 patients were included in these analyses, yielding a sample of 3538 patients (median age: 32 years; 52% women). Physical functioning, mental health, and QoL were measured with the SF-12 health status survey, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), linear analog scale (LAS) and Satisfaction with Life Scale, respectively. Functional class was assessed using the patient-reported New York Heart Association (NYHA) class. Multivariable general linear mixed models were applied to assess the relationship between the type of CHD and patient-reported outcomes, adjusted for patient characteristics, and with country as random effect. RESULTS: Patients with coarctation of the aorta and those with isolated aortic valve disease reported the best physical functioning, mental health, and QoL. Patients with cyanotic heart disease or Eisenmenger syndrome had worst outcomes. The differences were statistically significant, above and beyond other patient characteristics. However, the explained variances were small (0.6% to 4.1%) and decreased further when functional status was added to the models (0.4% to 0.9%). CONCLUSIONS: Some types of CHD predict worse patient-reported outcomes. However, it appears that it is the functional status associated with the heart defect rather than the heart defect itself that shapes the outcomes.  "
Uncertainty: An Uncomfortable Companion to Decision-making for Infants.  ;Although parents are typically the most appropriate decision-makers for their children, there are limits to this authority. Medical providers may be ethically obligated to seek state intervention against a parental decision if the parent places a child at significant and imminent risk of serious harm. When parents make medical decisions for their children, they assess both the projected benefits and risks of their choices for their family. These assessments are impacted by uncertainty, which is a common feature of neonatal intensive care. The relative presence or absence of uncertainty may impact perceptions of parental decisions and a medical provider's decision to seek state intervention to overrule parents. In this article, we propose a model integrating prognostic uncertainty into pediatric decision-making that may aid providers in such assessments. We will demonstrate how to apply this model to 3 neonatal cases and propose that the presence of greater uncertainty ought to permit parents greater latitude to incorporate family values into their decision-making even if these decisions are contradictory to the recommendations of the medical team.  
Guidelines for Balancing Priorities in Structural Heart Disease During the COVID-19 Pandemic.  ;"During the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, many hospitals have been asked to postpone elective and surgical cases. This begs the question, ""What is elective in structural heart disease intervention?"" The recently proposed Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions/American College of Cardiology consensus statement is, unfortunately, non-specific and insufficient in its scope and scale of response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We propose guidelines that are practical, multidisciplinary, implementable, and urgent. We believe that this will provide a helpful framework for our colleagues to manage their practices during the surge and peak phases of the pandemic. General principles that apply across structural heart disease interventions include tracking and reporting cardiovascular outcomes, ""healthcare distancing,"" preserving vital resources and personnel, shared decision-making between the heart team and hospital administration on resource-intensive cases, and considering delaying research cases. Specific guidance for transcatheter aortic valve replacement and MitraClip procedures varies according to pandemic phase. During the surge phase, treatment should broadly be limited to those at increased risk of complications in the near term. During the peak phase, treatment should be limited to inpatients for whom it may facilitate discharge. Keeping our patients and ourselves safe is paramount, as well as justly rationing resources.  "

[Aortic valve replacement via J-shaped partial upper sternotomy: randomized trial, mid-term results].  ;OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of aortic valve replacement through upper partial J-shaped sternotomy compared to conventional sternotomy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: There were 240 procedures of isolated aortic valve replacement for the period 2012-2017. According to inclusion criteria, 112 patients were randomized into 2 groups: group I - median sternotomy, group II - upper partial J-shaped sternotomy. Mean age of patients was 56.1±14.3 and 53.1±14.9 years, respectively (p=0.284). Females prevailed in both groups (55.4% vs. 57.1%, p=0.848). Peak pressure gradient on the aortic valve was 106.2±23.9 and 102.8±25.3 mm Hg, respectively (p=0.484). RESULTS: In-hospital mortality was 1.8% (n=1) in group I (p=0.315). Incidence of postoperative complications (complete atrioventricular blockade, ventricular septal defect) was similar (p=1.0). Mean time cross clamping in I and II groups was 65.5±12.5 and 64.7±13.1 min (p=0.729). Mean follow-up period was 31.6 and 33.5 months, respectively. Kaplan-Meier survival rate was 92.6 and 93.0%, respectively (log-rank test=0,767). Freedom from thromboembolic events was 91.7 and 90% (log-rank test=0.213). CONCLUSION. U: Pper partial J-shaped sternotomy is safe and effective for aortic valve surgery and characterized by similar outcomes compared to conventional sternotomy.  
Codeployment of a percutaneous edge-to-edge mitral valve repair device and a ventriculoseptal defect occluder device to address complex mitral regurgitation with leaflet perforation.  ;An 80-year-old male with severe, complex mitral regurgitation (MR) after recent transcatheter aortic valve replacement presented in heart failure for percutaneous mitral valve repair and possible tricuspid valve repair. Transesopheageal echocardiography (TEE) demonstrated mixed Carpentier Types 1 and 2 components with annular dilation, two leaflet perforations, and excessive leaflet motion (P2 flail). There were three distinct MR jets appreciated reflecting a central coaptation defect and two posterior mitral valve leaflet perforations emanating from a cystic dilatation. Under TEE guidance transseptal puncture and percutaneous edge-to-edge mitral valve repair was performed with a MitraClip XTR device (Abbott, IL). A 10 mm Amplatzer Muscular VSD Occluder (Abbott, Abbott Park, IL) was deployed to close one of the perforations on the posterior leaflet with a significant reduction in MR severity. Attempts at crossing the remaining defect were unsuccessful and the procedure was concluded. The patient recovered uneventfully and transthoracic echocardiography on postoperative day (POD) 1 and again on POD 34 demonstrated normal systolic dominance on pulmonary venous Doppler interrogation, mild to moderate MR, and a mean transvalvular gradient of 5 mmHg. Both devices appeared firmly attached and stable. This is the first documented use of a VSD occluder device in this clinical scenario. Management of complex MR with an approach combining edge-to-edge repair for a central coaptation defect and leaflet flail with codeployment of a VSD occluder device to address a perforated leaflet is feasible and can achieve durable results.  
Congenital Heart Defects and Dysmorphic Facial Features in Patients Suspicious of 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome in Southern Brazil.  ;22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) is considered one of the most frequently observed chromosomal abnormalities in association with congenital heart disease (CHD), which can also include some combination of other features. Thus, the aim of this work was to verify the profile of dysmorphic features and heart defects found in patients referred to a reference center in Southern Brazil with clinical findings suggestive of 22q11.2DS. In the overall sample group, only patients with dysmorphic facial features (skull, eyes, ear, and nose) associated with CHD (obstructive pulmonary valve ring, truncus arteriosus, and bicuspid aortic valve associated with atrial septal defect and/or right aortic arch) had a 22q11.2 deletion. These findings proved to be reliable clinical criteria for referral to perform fluorescent in situ hybridization investigation for 22q11.2 deletion.  
A Fatal Case of Cardiac Contusion After Blunt Chest Injury.  ;In this article, we report the autopsy findings of a 48-year-old man who sustained blunt trauma to the thorax. A medical record review revealed no history of cardiac disease. He presented to the hospital with a computed tomography-verified fracture of the left fourth and fifth ribs, and pulmonary and cardiac contusion. He was released from the hospital in stable condition at his own request 7 days later. Because of sudden deterioration, he was readmitted to the hospital the next day. Electrocardiogram detected cardiac arrhythmia on the 15th day after chest trauma. Electrocardiography detected pericardial effusion and severe mitral insufficiency resulting in left ventricular failure. Death was attributed to diffuse alveolar damage-complicating pneumonia due to cardiac contusion with mitral insufficiency occurring 25 days after hospital admission. Internal examination revealed diffuse fibrinous pericarditis, left atrial tear right above the anterior mitral valve leaflet with intrapericardial granulation tissue, and no sign of myocardial damage. Immunohistochemistry showed significantly more CD68-positive macrophages within tissue taken from the heart, a finding indicative of previous atrial and ventricular myocardial contusion. This case report demonstrates that routine hematoxylin and eosin staining may not always reveal significant myocardial damage.  
Cardiac Myxoma: Review and Update of Contemporary Immunohistochemical Markers and Molecular Pathology.  ;Cardiac myxoma is an uncommon benign mesenchymal neoplasm of the heart. It usually arises in the left atrium, near the valve of the fossa ovalis, and most frequently affects adults in the third through the sixth decades of life. It is hypothesized to arise from subendothelial vasoformative reserve cells or primitive cells that differentiate along the lines of the endothelium, but this remains speculative. Microscopically, the neoplastic cells are arranged individually, and nests, and are oriented in single or multiple layers around vascular channels. The neoplastic cells are immunoreactive for vimentin, calretinin, S100, nonspecific enolase, factor VIII, CD31, and CD34. The tumor can have diverse clinical presentations depending on its location and extent of disease and is predisposed to embolization. The current treatment is prompt surgical excision.  
How to manage an athlete with mitral valve prolapse.  ;INTRODUCTION: Under the term degenerative mitral valve prolapse different pathophysiological and clinical entities coexist in a spectrum ranging from Barlow's disease to fibroelastic deficiency, and represent the most common cause of mitral regurgitation in the general population and in athletes. Carrying a mitral valve prolapse is usually considered a benign condition for athletes, but recently the scientific literature has focused on the malignant, thus rare, arrhythmic mitral valve prolapse and its dramatic association with sudden cardiac death, so that specific features should be considered a red flag and prompt additional exams before clear for competition. DISCUSSION: As the athlete's heart is morphologically accompanied by remodelling and dilatation of the cardiac chambers induced by exercise, it may be challenging to differentiate the degree of left ventricular and atrial dilation induced by significant mitral regurgitation from physiological remodelling, especially in endurance athletes. CONCLUSION: This how-to article provides clinical and useful data to manage athletes with mitral valve prolapse and to distinguish high-risk athletes carrying the features of arrhythmic mitral valve prolapse.  
Beneficial Effects of Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonism on Myocardial Fibrosis in an Experimental Model of the Myxomatous Degeneration of the Mitral Valve.  ;Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) patients develop myocardial fibrosis that is not solely explained by volume overload, but the pathophysiology has not been defined. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) improve cardiac function by decreasing cardiac fibrosis in other heart diseases. We examined the role of MRA in myocardial fibrosis associated with myxomatous degeneration of the mitral valve. Myocardial fibrosis has been analyzed in a mouse model of mitral valve myxomatous degeneration generated by pharmacological treatment with Nordexfenfluramine (NDF) in the presence of the MRA spironolactone. In vitro, adult human cardiac fibroblasts were treated with NDF and spironolactone. In an experimental mouse, MRA treatment reduced interstitial/perivascular fibrosis and collagen type I deposition. MRA administration blunted NDF-induced cardiac expression of vimentin and the profibrotic molecules galectin-3/cardiotrophin-1. In parallel, MRA blocked the increase in cardiac non-fibrillar proteins such as fibronectin, aggrecan, decorin, lumican and syndecan-4. The following effects are blocked by MRA: in vitro, in adult human cardiac fibroblasts, NDF-treatment-induced myofibroblast activation, collagen type I and proteoglycans secretion. Our findings demonstrate, for the first time, the contribution of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) to the development of myocardial fibrosis associated with mitral valve myxomatous degeneration. MRA could be a therapeutic approach to reduce myocardial fibrosis associated with MVP.

Clinical risk model for predicting 1-year mortality after transcatheter aortic valve replacement.  ;OBJECTIVES: Estimating 1-year life expectancy is an essential factor when evaluating appropriate indicators for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). BACKGROUND: It is clinically useful in developing a reliable risk model for predicting 1-year mortality after TAVR. METHODS: We evaluated 2,588 patients who underwent TAVR using data from the Optimized CathEter vAlvular iNtervention (OCEAN) Japanese multicenter registry from October 2013 to May 2017. The 1-year clinical follow-up was achieved by 99.5% of the entire population (n = 2,575). Patients were randomly divided into two cohorts: the derivation cohort (n = 1,931, 75% of the study population) and the validation cohort (n = 644). Considerable clinical variables including individual patient's comorbidities and frailty markers were used for predicting 1-year mortality following TAVR. RESULTS: In the derivation cohort, a multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that sex, body mass index, Clinical Frailty Scale, atrial fibrillation, peripheral artery disease, prior cardiac surgery, serum albumin, renal function as estimated glomerular filtration rate, and presence of pulmonary disease were independent predictors of 1-year mortality after TAVR. Using these variables, a risk prediction model was constructed to estimate the 1-year risk of mortality after TAVR. In the validation cohort, the risk prediction model revealed high discrimination ability and acceptable calibration with area under the curve of 0.763 (95% confidence interval, 0.728-0.795, p < .001) in the receiver operating characteristics curve analysis and a Hosmer-Lemeshow χ2 statistic of 5.96 (p = .65). CONCLUSIONS: This risk prediction model for 1-year mortality may be a reliable tool for risk stratification and identification of adequate candidates in patients undergoing TAVR.  
Histological assessment of the human heart valves and its relationship with age.  ;The human heart valves are complex anatomical structures consisting of leaflets with many supporting structures. With advancing age, the microstructure of the components of the valves can change. Knowledge and understanding of the anatomical relationships between the different components of the heart valve structures and their relationship with age is crucial for the development and progression of treatment of valvular disease. The purpose of this study was to determine histological changes of the components of the heart valves and their relationship with age. Fifty hearts taken from cadavers were included to examine the histology of the tricuspid, mitral, pulmonary, and aortic valves. All specimens were stained with Elastic Van Gieson, and picrosirius red to enable the evaluation of elastic and collagen fibers, respectively. There was a gradual increase in elastic and collagen fibers with advancing age, particularly over 40 years, in all valve types. In the case of tricuspid and mitral valves increases in collagen and elastic fibers were observed starting in the fifth decade. Elastic fiber fragmentation was observed in specimens over 50 years. In the case of the pulmonary and the aortic valves, collagen fibers were denser and more irregular in the sixth to seventh decades when compared to younger ages while elastic fibers were significantly increased in the sixth decade. In addition, an increase in fat deposition had an association with aging. These findings provide additional basic knowledge in age-related morphological changes of the heart valves and will increase understanding concerning valvular heart diseases and treatment options.  
Functional assessment of bioprosthetic mitral valves by cardiovascular magnetic resonance: An in vitro validation and comparison to Doppler echocardiography.  ;"BACKGROUND: A comprehensive non-invasive evaluation of bioprosthetic mitral valve (BMV) function can be challenging. We describe a novel method to assess BMV effective orifice area (EOA) based on phase contrast (PC) cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) data. We compare the performance of this new method to Doppler and in vitro reference standards. METHODS: Four sizes of normal BMVs (27, 29, 31, 33 mm) and 4 stenotic BMVs (27 mm and 29 mm, with mild or severe leaflet obstruction) were evaluated using a CMR- compatible flow loop. BMVs were evaluated with PC-CMR and Doppler methods under flow conditions of; 70 mL, 90 mL and 110 mL/beat (n = 24). PC-EOA was calculated as PC-CMR flow volume divided by the PC- time velocity integral (TVI). RESULTS: PC-CMR measurements of the diastolic peak velocity and TVI correlated strongly with Doppler values (r = 0.99, P < 0.001 and r = 0.99, P < 0.001, respectively). Across all conditions tested, the Doppler and PC-CMR measurement of EOA (1.4 ± 0.5 vs 1.5 ± 0.7 cm2, respectively) correlated highly (r = 0.99, P < 0.001), with a minimum bias of 0.13 cm2, and narrow limits of agreement (- 0.2 to 0.5 cm2). CONCLUSION: We describe a novel method to assess BMV function based on PC measures of transvalvular flow volume and velocity integration. PC-CMR methods can be used to accurately measure EOA for both normal and stenotic BMV's and may provide an important new parameter of BMV function when Doppler methods are unobtainable or unreliable.

Ahmed T(1), Puckett Y(2).  ;Aortic valve functional unit is a central outflow tract of the left side of the heart. The operational unit of the left outflow tract consists of aortic valve cusps, commissures, annulus, and sinuses at the root of the aorta. This functional unit of the left ventricular outflow tract is responsible for maintaining the laminar flow of blood after ejection from the left ventricle. Aortic valve pathologies can have a severe generalized impact on the body based on the perfusion deficit. Aortic valve insufficiency is mostly due to the underlying shear force causing stretch, dilation, rupture of the valve. Moreover, conditions of the aortic root, including coarctation, dissection, and aneurysm, can increase the aortic valve pathology due to increase shear force of blood at the aortic valve disrupting the laminar flow. Aortic valve pathologies can be managed by repair or replacement. Aortic valve replacement with a biological or prosthetic valve has been the cornerstone of the management of aortic valve pathologies. However, aortic valve repair has been the topic of debate as compared to replacement in specific subsets of patients. Over the last decade, aortic valve repair and preservation gained exceptional significance in the treatment of aortic root disease with and without insufficiencies. Successful aortic valve repair and preservation methods have been performed worldwide with a prevalence of procedures, less than 2%, as it needs excellent expertise.  The prevalence of procedure performed is low as compared to mitral valve repair as calcific aortic stenosis is the most common valvular pathology seen, which has less success. As compared to repair, aortic valve replacement seems to be relatively simpler, but it has the downside of causing long term complications of structural deterioration, restenosis, infection, and bleeding due to anticoagulation. Therefore, aortic valve preservation procedures have become a reasonable alternative in preventing complications of replacement by maintaining nearby normal anatomy and physiology of the aortic valve functional unit.  
Agasthi P(1), Graziano JN(2).  ;Due to advances in several medical subspecialties such as pediatric cardiology and pediatric cardiac surgery, the prevalence of congenital heart disease has increased to 1 in 150 in adulthood, in which about half have undergone surgery in childhood. A significant proportion of patients will need re-intervention in adulthood. The right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) is affected in about 20% of newborns with congenital heart disease, including defects such as tetralogy of Fallot (ToF), truncus arteriosus (TA), pulmonary atresia, etc. Palliation of these defects necessitates various reconstruction techniques with bio-prosthetic valves, trans-annular patches, and conduits between right ventricle (RV) and pulmonary artery (PA). These conduits are usually required when there is an associated anomalous left anterior descending artery (LAD) from the right coronary artery (RCA) crossing the RVOT, thereby precluding a transannular patch repair. While these conduits can restore normal pulmonary valve function, there are subsequent morbidities that can develop, such as conduit calcifications, intimal proliferation, and somatic growth, which therefore make the durability of these conduits limited, and ultimately requiring re-intervention.  The etiology of conduit dysfunction over time is multifactorial and can depend on the patient's age, the defect, tissue type, intervention type, and the material employed. Furthermore, homograft valve deterioration can cause significant RVOT dysfunction, pulmonary regurgitation (PR), and pulmonary stenosis (PS), with about half of the patients requiring re-intervention. Additionally, surgical reoperation can have significant morbidity and even mortality due to chest adhesions, cardiac ischemia, heart failure, and multi-organ dysfunction. Earlier surgical interventions for TOF included the transannular patch procedure with consequences such as pulmonary insufficiency, dilation of tricuspid annulus resulting in tricuspid regurgitation (TR), right ventricular dilation, and atrial and ventricular arrhythmias as a potential etiology of sudden cardiac death (SCD). Transcatheter intervention with balloon angioplasty and stent implantation was a remarkable advancement but still resulted in significant pulmonary regurgitation. Transcatheter pulmonary valve implantation (TPVI), which is a common intervention in adult patients with congenital heart disease patients today, has been introduced as a much less invasive approach, allowing earlier restoration of pulmonary valve function before the onset of irreversible remodeling and dysfunction, and potentially fewer lifetime surgical interventions.  
Salik I(1), Lee L, Widrich J(2).  ;Although the standard of care for mitral valve (MV) pathology due to degenerative changes is surgical repair, patient outcomes depend on multiple factors including pre-operative status, the severity of mitral regurgitation (MR), the technique of repair and surgeon and center experience. If MV repair is carried out in a timely fashion, the operative risk is low, and life expectancy is close to that of similar sex-aged matched controls. In high-risk patients, the choice amongst surgical, percutaneous, and conservative approaches can be challenging but should have as its basis patient comorbidities and surgical expertise. Mitral valve repair (MVr) surgery has some advantages over mitral valve replacement (MVR), although patient-specific factors must be taken into consideration. Of note, close to 50% of patients with severe mitral valve pathology are not candidates for surgical intervention due to age or other comorbidities. Up to 2 to 3% of adults in the United States are afflicted with degenerative mitral valve disease. Patients with degenerative MV pathology who develop symptoms of MR have a poor prognosis, with annual mortality rates of up to 34%. Mitral stenosis (MS), primarily caused by rheumatic heart disease (RHD), is commonly treated by percutaneous balloon mitral valvuloplasty or MVR. Repair is usually not feasible in these patients with rheumatic mitral disease. MR is classified as primary or secondary, depending on whether the lesion is located at the mitral valve apparatus or due to left ventricular changes, respectively. While severe primary MR still receives treatment with surgical intervention, percutaneous techniques for repair and replacement are also gaining traction. MVR may be considered in patients with MR caused by papillary muscle rupture, degenerative and ischemic MR, or in patients with a failed repair undergoing reoperation.  
Contributing Factor of Proximal Arch Dilation in Patients with Bicuspid Aortic Valve-Wall Shear Stress or Upward Extension of Ascending Aorta Dilation?  ;"PURPOSE: The dilation of proximal arch (PArc) was suspected to develop as a result of valve-related hemodynamics or in consequence to the upward extension of the ascending aorta (AAo) dilation. We aimed to investigate the one that could be the possible contributing factor in patients with bicuspid aortic valve (BAV). METHODS: All enrolled BAV patients underwent four-dimensional flow magnetic resonance imaging. Contour-averaged circumferential wall shear stress (WSScirc,avg) and the diameter of the middle of AAo (mid-AAo) were compared between the patients with and without PArc dilation. Additionally, we analyzed the correlation between WSScirc,avg and aortic diameter at PArc section, as well as the correlation between the diameter of mid-AAo and that of PArc. RESULTS: No significant difference was observed in WSScirc,avg at PArc section between the patients with and without PArc dilation (P = .621). However, the diameter of mid-AAo in the patients who suffered PArc dilation was higher than those without it (P = .007). In addition, the aortic diameter did not correlate with the WSScirc,avg at PArc level (R = -0.068, P = .701). The correlation was observed between PArc diameter and mid-AAo diameter (R = 0.521, P = .002). CONCLUSION: Hemodynamics may not contribute to the development of PArc dilation. PArc diameter correlated with mid-AAo diameter, indicating PArc dilation may be secondary to the upward extension of AAo dilation. The influence of AAo dilation extending upward could be treated by AAo replacement; hence, a selective approach to transverse PArc replacement might be appropriate.  "

Early Surgery versus Watchful Waiting in Patients with Moderate Aortic Stenosis and Left Ventricular Systolic Dysfunction.  ;"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Severe aortic stenosis (AS) with left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) is a class I indication for aortic valve replacement (AVR) but this recommendation is not well established in those at the stage of moderate AS. We investigate the clinical impact of AVR among patients with moderate AS and LVSD. METHODS: From 2001 to 2017, we consecutively identified patients with moderate AS and LVSD, defined as aortic valve area 1.0-1.5 cm² and left ventricular ejection fraction <50%. The primary outcome was all-cause death. The outcomes were compared between those who underwent early surgical AVR (within 2 years of index echocardiography) at the stage of moderate AS versus those who were followed medically without AVR at the outpatient clinic. RESULTS: Among 255 patients (70.1±11.3 years, male 62%), 37 patients received early AVR. The early AVR group was younger than the medical observation group (63.1±7.9 vs. 71.3±11.4) with a lower prevalence of hypertension and chronic kidney disease. During a median 1.8-year follow up, 121 patients (47.5%) died, and the early AVR group showed a significantly lower all-cause death rate than the medical observation group (5.03PY vs. 18.80PY, p<0.001). After multivariable Cox-proportional hazard regression adjusting for age, sex, comorbidities, and laboratory data, early AVR at the stage of moderate AS significantly reduced the risk of death (hazard ratio, 0.43; 95% confidence interval 0.20-0.91; p=0.028). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with moderate AS and LVSD, AVR reduces the risk of all-cause death. A prospective randomized trial is warranted to confirm our findings.  "
TAVR in Patients with Pure Aortic Regurgitation: Ready to Use?  ;PURPOSE OF THE REVIEW: Moderate or severe aortic regurgitation (AR) occurs in 0.5% of the population and typically peaks in the fourth to sixth decade of life. A significant proportion of patients have prohibitive surgical risk and are therefore treated medically with pharmacological management of heart failure and no definitive treatment of the underlying valvular pathology. RECENT FINDINGS: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has been used in an off-label setting to treat AR to attempt to reduce mortality and improve quality of life with varying levels of success. New-generation TAVR devices currently used in AS have demonstrated safety and feasibility when used in patients with AR. Novel TAVR devices dedicated for use in AR are being developed and early studies demonstrate promising results. Ongoing studies with larger clinical trials and novel methods of device anchoring are required, which if positive, will in turn lead to commercial approval and reimbursement, eventually making TAVR ready for use in AR.  
Multimodality imaging assessment of mitral annular disjunction in mitral valve prolapse.  ;"OBJECTIVE: Mitral annular disjunction (MAD) is an abnormality linked to mitral valve prolapse (MVP), possibly associated with malignant ventricular arrhythmias. We assessed the agreement among different imaging techniques for MAD identification and measurement. METHODS: 131 patients with MVP and significant mitral regurgitation undergoing transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) were retrospectively enrolled. Transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) was available in 106 patients. MAD was evaluated in standard long-axis views (four-chamber, two-chamber, three-chamber) by each technique. RESULTS: Considering any-length MAD, MAD prevalence was 17.3%, 25.5%, 42.0% by TTE, TOE and CMR, respectively (p<0.05). The agreement on MAD identification was moderate between TTE and CMR (κ=0.54, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.59) and good between TOE and CMR (κ=0.79, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.84). Assuming CMR as reference and according to different cut-off values for MAD (≥2 mm, ≥4 mm, ≥6 mm), specificity (95% CI) of TTE and TOE was 99.6 (99.0 to 100.0)% and 98.7 (97.4 to 100.0)%; 99.3 (98.4 to 100.0)% and 97.6 (95.8 to 99.4)%; 97.8 (96.2 to 99.3)% and 93.2 (90.3 to 96.1)%, respectively; sensitivity (95% CI) was 43.1 (37.8 to 48.4)% and 74.5 (69.4 to 79.5)%; 54.0 (48.7 to 59.3)% and 88.9 (85.2 to 92.5)%; 88.0 (84.5 to 91.5)% and 100.0 (100.0 to 100.0)%, respectively. MAD length was 8.0 (7.0-10.0), 7.0 (5.0-8.0], 5.0 (4.0-7.0) mm, respectively by TTE, TOE and CMR. Agreement on MAD measurement was moderate between TTE and CMR (ρ=0.73) and strong between TOE and CMR (ρ=0.86). CONCLUSIONS: An integrated imaging approach could be necessary for a comprehensive assessment of patients with MVP and symptoms suggestive for arrhythmias. If echocardiography is fundamental for the anatomic and haemodynamic characterisation of the MV disease, CMR may better identify small length MAD as well as myocardial fibrosis.  "
Perioperative Management of Hemophilia A Patients Undergoing Cardiac Surgery: A Literature Review of Published Cases.  ;"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the perioperative management of patients with hemophilia A (HA) who undergo cardiac surgery. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of the published literature. SETTING: University hospital. PARTICIPANTS: HA patients undergoing cardiac surgery. INTERVENTIONS: The PubMed, Embase, Web of Science Core Collection, CNKI, VIP, and WANFANG databases were searched with the terms ""hemophilia A,"" ""cardiac surgery,"" ""cardiopulmonary bypass,"" ""coronary artery bypass graft,"" ""valve disease,"" and ""congenital heart disease"" to identify relevant articles. Data regarding patient characteristics, perioperative management protocols, and clinical outcomes were extracted and analyzed. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Fifty articles, with 72 patients aging from 12 days to 80 years, were included. The analyzed population consisted of 36 (50%) mild HA, 10 (14%) moderate HA, and 25 (35%) severe HA patients. Factor VIII inhibitors were detected in 7 cases. Surgical procedures included 27 coronary artery bypass grafting procedures, 15 valve surgeries, 8 combined coronary artery bypass grafting with valve surgery procedures (1 with left ventricular assist device), 1 ventricular aneurysm resection with valve surgery, 11 corrections of congenital heart disease, 7 adult aortic surgeries, 3 heart transplantations, and 1 repair of heart injury. Factor VIII concentrates were used as a substitution therapy to ensure normalization of perioperative coagulation function. Although an uneventful clinical outcome was achieved in the majority of cases, 20% of patients developed complications with different severities. CONCLUSIONS: Execution of a perioperative management strategy with a multidisciplinary approach, a thorough factor replacement protocol, and careful monitoring of factor levels facilitate an optimal outcome for HA patients undergoing cardiac surgery.

Impact of Loop Diuretic Use on Outcomes Following Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.  ;The use of LDT may signify significant hemodynamic changes and left ventricular remodeling in severe aortic stenosis (AS). Therefore, we sought to determine whether loop diuretic therapy (LDT) is associated with adverse outcomes following transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in patients with severe symptomatic AS. Subjects undergoing TAVI at a single institution from June 2008 to December 2017 were analyzed. LDT doses were normalized to oral furosemide daily equivalents. All outcomes were adjudicated using VARC2 criteria. Descriptive statistics, multivariate logistic regression, and propensity score matching were used. Of the 804 subjects studied, 48.3% were on pre-TAVI LDT with a mean dose of 51.1 mg furosemide dose-equivalents. Subjects on LDT were higher risk, frail patients with more co-morbidities including chronic kidney disease, coronary artery disease requiring prior bypass grafting, peripheral arterial disease, atrial fibrillation or flutter, and diabetes with more severe heart failure symptoms. Those on LDT also had worse left ventricular systolic function, lower transvalvular gradients, and markers of adverse left ventricular remodeling, including increased left ventricular mass index and higher rates of concentric and eccentric hypertrophy. On propensity-score matching, death within one year post-TAVI was borderline significantly higher in the pre-LDT as compared with no-LDT group (16.9% vs 10.4 %, p = 0.068). In conclusion, use of pre-TAVI LDT for severe symptomatic AS is associated with a trend towards worse 1-year mortality and is a marker of high-risk, frail individuals with advanced left ventricular remodeling.  
Minimally invasive mitral valve replacement and concomitant Cox-Maze IV procedure using radiofrequency energy in situs inversus totalis: A case report.  ;INTRODUCTION: Situs inversus totalis (SIT) is an uncommon congenital condition characterized by total transposition of abdominal and thoracic viscera. Performing minimally invasive cardiac surgery on individuals with SIT requires different surgical planning because of the unfamiliar positions of the heart and great vessels. PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 52-year-old female was admitted to our center with palpitations and dyspnea on exertion. Chest X-ray showed dextrocardia. Echocardiography and chest computerized tomography (CT) revealed SIT with severe rheumatic mitral valve disease. DISCUSSION: Pre-operative three-dimensional (3D) chest CT reconstruction was helpful in surgical planning and management of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Mitral valve replacement and concomitant atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation using radiofrequency (RF) energy via left mini-thoracotomy was successfully performed on the patient. CONCLUSION: Minimally invasive approach can be safely and effectively employed in patients with SIT.  
Infective Endocarditis After Transcatheter Versus Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement: A Meta-Analysis.  ;We determined the incidence, clinical characteristics, and risk factors of post-transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR)-associated infective endocarditis (IE). We compared the incidence of IE after TAVR versus after surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). The incidence rate of IE 1-year post-TAVR was 0.9% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.8-1.0). Transcatheter aortic valve replacement was associated with significantly reduced IE incidence (incidence rate ratio: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.52-0.92, P = .011) compared with SAVR. In patients with TAVR IE, the pooled in-hospital mortality was 37.8% (95% CI: 32.4-43.3, I 2 = 54.9%). Pooled adjusted hazard ratio (HR) revealed that peri-procedural peripheral artery disease (HR: 4.02, 95% CI: 2.28-7.10, P < .0001), moderate or severe residual aortic regurgitation (HR: 2.34, 95% CI: 1.53-3.59, P < .0001), orotracheal intubation (HR: 2.13, 95% CI: 1.19-3.82, P = .011), and male gender (HR: 1.70, 95% CI: 1.47-1.97, P < .0001) were risk factors for post-TAVR IE. Post-TAVR IE is a life-threatening complication often resulting in in-hospital mortality. The current evidence-based meta-analysis to identify risk factors may lead to the development of effective preventive and therapeutic strategies for post-TAVR IE to ultimately improve patient outcomes.  
Annulus root enlargement during redo aortic valve replacement: Perioperative results and hemodynamic impact.  ;"OBJECTIVES: Redo aortic valve replacement (AVR) might present an increased risk for predicted patient-prosthesis mismatch (PPM). Aortic root enlargement (ARE) procedures can decrease PPM and improve hemodynamic parameters. It is crucial to evaluate the safety of ARE in the context of redo AVR to allow better patient selection. METHODS: This is a matched case-control study of 125 patients who underwent a redo AVR between 1991 and 2016, 21 patients had a concomitant ARE procedure. Patients were matched for age, gender, presence of coronary artery disease, renal clearance, left ventricular ejection fraction, and body mass index. The primary outcome was the occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Secondary outcomes were postoperative impact of the ARE procedures on echocardiographic measurements and survival. RESULTS: Preoperatively, indexed aortic valve area (0.49 vs 0.66 cm2 /m2 ; P = .02) and left ventricle outflow tract diameters (20.1 vs 22.2 mm; P < .01) were significantly smaller in the ARE group. ARE procedures increased the aortic valve area by an average of 0.4 cm2 (pre = 0.9, post = 1.3; P < .01), with a reduction of maximum and mean transvalvular gradients of 26.6 mm Hg (pre = 56.8, post = 30.2; P < .01) and 17.1 mm Hg (pre = 31.9, post = 14.8; P < .01), respectively. Postoperatively, the occurrence of MACE was similar (ARE = 19%, no ARE = 14%; P = .68). Survival rates were similar (P = .29). CONCLUSIONS: For patients undergoing redo AVR, ARE is not associated with higher perioperative mortality and morbidity when compared with patients undergoing AVR without ARE. The fear of perioperative complications potentially associated with ARE should not be a prohibiting factor in symptomatic redo patients with small aortic annulus and predicted PPM.  "
Novel loss of function mutation in NOTCH1 in a family with bicuspid aortic valve, ventricular septal defect, thoracic aortic aneurysm, and aortic valve stenosis.  ;BACKGROUND: Bicuspid aortic valve is the most common congenital valvular heart defect in the general population. BAV is associated with significant morbidity due to valve failure, formation of thoracic aortic aneurysm, and increased risk of infective endocarditis and aortic dissection. Loss of function mutations in NOTCH1 (OMIM 190198) has previously been associated with congenital heart disease involving the aortic valve, left ventricle outflow tract, and mitral valve that segregates in affected pedigrees as an autosomal dominant trait with variable expressivity. METHODS: We performed whole-exome sequencing in four members of a three-generational family (three affected and one unaffected subject) with clinical phenotypes including aortic valve stenosis, thoracic aortic aneurysm, and ventricular septal defect. RESULTS: We identified 16 potentially damaging genetic variants (one stop variant, one splice variant, and 14 missense variants) cosegregating with the phenotype. Of these variants, the nonsense mutation (p.Tyr291*) in NOTCH1 was the most deleterious variant identified and the most likely variant causing the disease. CONCLUSION: Inactivating NOTCH1 mutations are a rare cause of familial heart disease involving predominantly left ventricular outflow tract lesions and characterized by the heterogeneity of clinical phenotype.

Spontaneous Conversion of Long-Standing Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter.  ;There have been no recent descriptions of the spontaneous conversion of long-standing atrial fibrillation (AF) or flutter (AFl) to sinus rhythm which, in the past, has been associated with rheumatic mitral valve disease and treatment with digoxin. We present 3 contemporary cases, all of whom progressed from AF to slow AFl and then spontaneously converted to slow sinus or junctional rhythm. None of these patients had rheumatic heart disease or were treated with digoxin. In conclusion, we believe that they provide support for the broader view that this uncommon phenomenon is associated with a severe atrial myopathy due to scar and inflammation.  
Management of valvular heart disease in the pregnant patient.  ;INTRODUCTION: Among cardiovascular disease in pregnancy, valvular heart disease remains a prevalent cause of maternal and fetal morbidity. The physiological changes of pregnancy can lead to decompensation of known or silent valvular heart disease. This poses a challenge to both physicians and patients in determining the best timing and management of valvular disease in the pre and post conception settings. This condition requires specific care to minimize both maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. AREAS COVERED: In this article, we review the recommended management of valvular heart disease in pregnancy, which include stenotic lesions, regurgitant lesions and prosthetic valves. EXPERT OPINION: Overall, left sided stenotic lesions are poorly tolerated and require intervention prior to pregnancy in cases of severe or symptomatic stenosis. Regurgitant lesions, isolated right sided lesions and bioprosthetic valves are better tolerated. Mechanical valves pose a challenging scenario given the high risk for valve thrombosis which must be balanced with the risk of bleeding and fetal embryopathy. Shared decision making is primordial in choosing the anticoagulant strategy during pregnancy in patients with mechanical valves.  
Epidemiological study of congenital heart diseases in dogs: Prevalence, popularity, and volatility throughout twenty years of clinical practice.  ;"The epidemiology of Congenital Heart Diseases (CHDs) has changed over the past twenty years. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of CHDs in the population of dogs recruited in a single referral center (RC); compare the epidemiological features of CHDs in screened breeds (Boxers) versus non-screened (French and English Bulldogs, German Shepherds); investigate the association of breeds with the prevalence of CHDs; determine the popularity and volatility of breeds over a 20-year period; analysed the trends of the most popular breeds in the overall population of new-born dogs registered in the Italian Kennel Club (IKC) from 1st January 1997 to 31st December 2017. The RC's cardiological database was analysed, and 1,779 clinical records were included in a retrospective observation study. Descriptive statistics and frequencies regarding the most representative breeds and CHDs were generated. A logistic regression model was used to analyse the trends of the most common CHDs found in single and in cluster of breeds. The relationship between breed popularity and presence of CHDs was studied. The most common CHDs were Pulmonic Stenosis, Patent Ductus Arteriosus, Subaortic Stenosis, Ventricular Septal Defect, Aortic Stenosis, Tricuspid Dysplasia, Atrial Septal Defect, Double Chamber Right Ventricle, Mitral Dysplasia, and others less frequent. The most represented pure breeds were Boxer, German Shepherd, French Bulldog, English Bulldog, Maltese, Newfoundland, Rottweiler, Golden Retriever, Chihuahua, and others in lower percentage. Chihuahuas, American Staffordshire Terriers, Border Collies, French Bulldogs, and Cavalier King Charles Spaniel were the most appreciated all of which showed a high value of volatility. This study found evidence for the value of the screening program implemented in Boxers; fashions and trends influence dog owners' choices more than the worries of health problems in a breed. Effective breeding programs are needed in order to control the diffusion of CHDs without impoverishing the genetic pool.  "
Association of Cardiac Rehabilitation With All-Cause Mortality Among Patients With Cardiovascular Disease in the Netherlands.  ;"IMPORTANCE: Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is an effective strategy to improve clinical outcomes, but it remains underused in some subgroups of patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD). OBJECTIVE: To investigate the implications of sex, age, socioeconomic status, CVD diagnosis, cardiothoracic surgery, and comorbidity for the association between CR participation and all-cause mortality. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Observational cohort study with patient enrollment between July 1, 2012, and December 31, 2017, and a follow-up to March 19, 2020. The dates of analysis were March to May 2020. This study was performed among Dutch patients with CVD with a multidisciplinary outpatient CR program indication and who were insured at Coöperatie Volksgezondheidszorg, one of the largest health insurance companies in the Netherlands. Among 4.1 million beneficiaries, patients with CVD with an acute coronary event (myocardial infarction or unstable angina pectoris), stable angina pectoris, chronic heart failure, or cardiothoracic surgery (coronary artery bypass grafting, valve replacement, or percutaneous coronary intervention) were identified by inpatient diagnosis codes and included in the study. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate the association between CR participation and all-cause mortality. Stabilized inverse propensity score weighting was used to account for patient and disease characteristics associated with CR participation. RESULTS: Among 83 687 eligible patients with CVD (mean [SD] age, 67 [12] years; 60.4% [n = 50 512] men), only 31.3% (n = 26 171) participated in CR, with large variation across different subgroups (range, 5.1%-73.0%). During a mean (SD) of 4.7 (1.8) years of follow-up, 1966 CR participants (7.5%) and 13 443 CR nonparticipants (23.4%) died. After multivariable adjustment, CR participation was associated with a 32% lower risk of all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.65-0.71) compared with nonparticipation. Sex, age, socioeconomic status, and comorbidity did not alter risk reduction after CR participation, but a statistically significant interaction association was found across categories of CVD diagnosis and cardiothoracic surgery. Larger reductions in risk estimates for all-cause mortality were found after CR participation for STEMI (adjusted HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.52-0.68 vs 0.72; 95% CI, 0.65-0.79; P < .001), NSTEMI (adjusted HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.58-0.70 vs 0.72; 95% CI, 0.65-0.79; P < .001), and stable AP (adjusted HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.63-0.76 vs 0.72; 95% CI, 0.65-0.79; P < .001) compared with patients with chronic heart failure, whereas unstable AP had a smaller risk reduction (adjusted HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.67-0.85 vs 0.72; 95% CI, 0.65-0.79; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, CR participation was associated with a 32% risk reduction in all-cause mortality, and this benefit was independent of sex, age, socioeconomic status, and comorbidity. These findings reinforce the importance of CR participation in secondary prevention and highlight the possibility that CR should be prescribed more widely to vulnerable patients with CVD, such as older adults with chronic diseases or multimorbidity.

Early myocardial changes in patients undergoing rheumatic mitral valve repair versus replacement.  ;BACKGROUND: Rheumatic mitral valve repair and replacement techniques are frequently used with excellent outcomes in experienced centers. This study aims to evaluate the impact of procedural types on left ventricular function in quinquagenarians. METHODS: Between January 2018 and September 2019, patients with severe rheumatic mitral stenosis were prospectively recruited. Propensity score matching was performed to reduce the selection bias. We compared the strain, twist and synchrony parameters of left ventricle in 70 quinquagenarian patients who underwent rheumatic mitral valve repair and replacement 12 hours before surgery, at 7 days and 6 months postoperatively. RESULTS: The overall group displayed significant improvement of left ventricular deformation after rheumatic mitral valve surgery. Compared with patients undergoing posterior chordal-sparing mitral valve replacement, patients undergoing rheumatic mitral valve repair showed more significant amelioration in global longitudinal strain (-18.6% versus -16.2%, P<0.001), twist (18.2° versus 15.9°, P<0.001), torsion (1.8°/cm versus 1.3°/cm, P<0.001), apical rotation (10.5° versus 8.8°, P<0.001), basal rotation (-7.7° versus -7.1°, P=0.049), systolic dyssynchrony index (4.7% versus 5.1%, P=0.021), standard deviation of time to peak longitudinal (46.9 ms versus 49.3 ms, P=0.024) and radial strain (15.8 ms versus 17.1 ms, P=0.037) at 6-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Rheumatic mitral valve repair might provide patients with better postoperative left ventricular performance than posterior chordal-sparing mitral valve replacement. Longer follow-up is required to compare long-term outcomes.  
Adult Congenital Heart Disease Survivors at Age 50 Years: Medical and Psychosocial Status.  ;"BACKGROUND: Although advances in congenital heart disease (CHD) management have allowed survival of children with even highly complex CHD lesions well into adult life, the burden of disease (medical, psychological and social) has not been well characterised, for those living to middle age and beyond. METHODS: We assessed 121 consecutive patients from our adult CHD centre, who survived to age 50 years and who had had moderate or complex CHD lesions. Pre-specified groups included those with repaired tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) (n=56), coarctation of the aorta (CoA) (n=34), systemic right ventricle (RV) (n=9), Fontan surgery for ""single ventricle"" hearts (n=5), those with repaired Ebstein's Anomaly (n=9) and other complex CHD (n=8). RESULTS: The overall burden of disease was very substantial. Of the TOF patients, almost half (46%) had required at least one open-heart reoperation and 41% had had a pacemaker or implantable defibrillator; 20% had had a radiofrequency ablation and 32% were anti-arrhythmic therapy. Over 40% had ≥1 admission for heart failure and 9% had had endocarditis. Only 64% were still employed. Of the CoA survivors, 50% had had a second operation (aortic valve and/or descending aortic surgery), 88% were on medications for hypertension and 62% were still employed. In the more complex groups, approximately half had been diagnosed with depression/anxiety and cerebrovascular event, heart failure and/or significant arrhythmias were common. CONCLUSIONS: Despite considerable advances, adults with CHD who survive to age 50 years have experienced high levels of physical and mental health complications.  "
Outcome of Patients Having Transcatheter Mitral Valve Implantation for the Treatment of Degenerated Mitral Bioprostheses.  ;Transcatheter mitral valve implantation (TMVI) is at various levels of preclinical investigation and has proven to be more challenging than transcatheter aortic valve implantation due to more complex anatomy. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the short-term and long-term outcomes of high-risk patients who underwent TMVI for degenerated mitral bioprostheses. In this retrospective, observational study, we reviewed data on the first 26 patients with previous surgical mitral valve replacement or repair with annular ring that underwent TMVI using the balloon-expandable heart-valve system at our institution from 2014 to 2019. We reviewed pre/postprocedure echocardiographic data, in-hospital, 30-day data and 1-year outcomes. The indication for TMVI was mitral regurgitation (MR) in 9 patients, mitral stenosis in 9 patients and mixed mitral disease in 8 patients. There was a 100% device implantation success rate and a 96% in-hospital survival rate. Survival was 96% at 30 days and 85% at 1 year. Mean mitral gradient (MMG) improved postprocedure (13.3 mm Hg to 6.8 mm Hg, p <0.0001) and was sustained at 1 year (13.3 mm Hg to 7.2 mm Hg, p <0.0001). MR grade improved postprocedure (3+ to 1+, p <0.0001) and was sustained at 1 year (3+ to 0, p <0.0001). Additionally there was significant 30-day and 1-year improvements in patients' Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire score after TMVI (47.8 to 75.7 to 84.0, p = <0.0001). In conclusion, our early experience with treatment of degenerated mitral bioprostheses using TMVI in high-risk patients resulted in significant short-term and sustained long-term improvements in mean mitral gradient, MR and heart failure symptoms.  
Three-dimensional geometry of coronary arteries after arterial switch operation for transposition of the great arteries and late coronary events.  ;"OBJECTIVE: Using 3-dimensional (3D) modeling to predict late coronary events after the arterial switch operation (ASO) for transposition of the great arteries (TGA). METHOD: We reviewed 100 coronary computed tomography scans performed after ASO randomly selected from free-from-coronary-event patients and 21 coronary computed tomography scans from patients who had a coronary event later than 3 years after ASO. Using 3D modeling software, we defined and measured 6 geometric criteria for each coronary artery: Clockwise position of coronary ostium, First centimeter angle defined as the angle between of the coronary artery ostium and the first centimeter of the vessel, Minimal 3D angle between the coronary first centimeter and the aortic wall, ostium height defined as the distance between the ostium and the aortic valve, distance between the coronary ostium and the pulmonary artery, and distance between the coronary first centimeter and the pulmonary artery. RESULTS: None of the right ostium geometric parameters were associated with coronary events. Four out of 6 criteria of left coronary artery geometry were associated to coronary events: Clockwise position of the left ostium >67° (P < .001), First centimeter angle >62° (P < .01), minimal 3D angle <39° (P = .003), distance between the coronary ostium and the pulmonary artery <1 mm/mm (P = .03). The association of first centimeter angle >62° and minimal angle in 3D <39° had a 88% sensitivity and a 81% specificity to predict coronary events (receiver operator characteristics curve, 0.847; 95% confidence interval, 0.745-0.949; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: The acquired geometric characteristics of the transferred left coronary artery are associated with coronary events. Imaging coronary arteries after ASO might be useful to select patients at higher risk of coronary events and to tailor surveillance.  "

Color Doppler Splay: A Clue to the Presence of Significant Mitral Regurgitation.  ;"BACKGROUND: The authors describe a previously unreported Doppler signal associated with mitral regurgitation (MR) as imaged using transthoracic echocardiography. Horizontal ""splay"" of the color Doppler signal along the atrial surface of the valve may indicate significant regurgitation when the MR jet otherwise appears benign. METHODS: Splay was defined as a nonphysiologic arc of color centered at the point at which the MR jet emerges into the left atrium. The authors present a series of 10 cases of clinically significant MR (moderately severe or severe as defined by transesophageal echocardiography) that were misclassified on transthoracic echocardiography as less than moderate. The splay signal was present on at least one standard transthoracic view in each case. To better characterize the splay signal, two groups were created from existing clinically driven transthoracic echocardiograms: 100 consecutive patients with severe MR and 100 with mild MR. RESULTS: Splay was present in the majority of severe MR cases (81%) regardless of vendor machine, ejection fraction, or MR etiology. Splay was particularly prevalent among patients with wall-hugging jets (28 of 30 [93%]). In patients with mild MR, splay was present less often (16%), on fewer frames per clip, and had smaller dimensions compared with severe MR. Color scale did not differ between subjects with and those without splay, but color gain was higher when splay was present (P = .04). Machine settings were further explored in a single subject with prominent splay: increasing transducer frequency reduced splay, while increasing color gain increased it. CONCLUSIONS: The authors describe a new transthoracic echocardiographic sign of MR. Horizontal splay may be a clue to the presence of severe MR when the main body of the jet is out of the imaging plane. Splay is likely generated as a side-lobe artifact due to a high-flux regurgitant jet.  "
Cone versus conventional repair for Ebstein's anomaly.  ;"OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate tricuspid valve function and adverse events after conventional repair and valve replacement for Ebstein's anomaly and compare them with cone repair. METHODS: The medical records of 151 patients (mean age, 25 years; 62% were female) who underwent operation in a single center from 1985 to 2018 were retrospectively analyzed. To determine tricuspid valve regurgitation during follow-up, serial echocardiographic examination was used (n = 2397, tricuspid regurgitation grades were graphed for every patient). RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients underwent cone repair, 107 patients underwent other repair techniques, and 5 patients underwent valve replacement. The operative mortality was 1.3% (n = 2). Failed valve repair (defined as in-hospital death, conversion to replacement, or in-hospital reoperation) was less frequent after cone repair than after other repair techniques (5%, n = 2 vs 20%, n = 21, P = .039). Mean follow-up was 12.3 years (cone repair: 3.7 years). The 5-year cumulative incidence of moderate or greater recurrent tricuspid regurgitation was lower after cone repair than after other repair techniques (8% vs 32%, P = .03). Among the patients undergoing other repair techniques, the 15-year cumulative incidence of moderate or greater recurrent tricuspid regurgitation, severe tricuspid regurgitation, and reoperation was 58%, 37%, and 31%, respectively. During follow-up, 18 patients died (13 of cardiac and 5 of noncardiac causes). Among patients who died of cardiac causes, 10 of 13 had all 3 characteristics-moderate or greater tricuspid regurgitation, atrial fibrillation, and New York Heart Association classification III and IV-at their last medical evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: Before cone repair, recurrent tricuspid regurgitation was considerable. Cone repair provided a higher rate of successful repair and a lower incidence of moderate or greater recurrent tricuspid regurgitation at the midterm follow-up.  "
Predictors of Acute Kidney Injury Following Surgical Valve Replacement.  ;BACKGROUND:  Acute kidney injury is a serious complication after surgical valve replacement and holds increased mortality rates. OBJECTIVES:  To study predictors of acute kidney injury after surgical valve replacement. MATERIALS AND METHODS:  Patients who underwent valve surgery procedures at our center were included. Procedures included aortic valve replacement (AVR), mitral valve replacement (MVR), AVR with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), MVR with CABG, or AVR and MVR with/without CABG. RESULTS:  A total of 346 patients were included. The mean age was 51.56 (16.1). Males (n = 178) comprised 51%.At the univariate level analysis, predictors of acute kidney injury were found including age, ejection fraction, hypertension, history of CAD, emergency surgery, recent myocardial infarction, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, history of heart failure, mitral regurgitation (MR), pump time >120 minutes, aortic cross clamp >90 minutes, perioperative blood transfusion, re-exploration for bleeding, use of mechanical and biologic valve in aortic position, use of biologic valve in mitral position, prolonged inotropic support, postoperative stroke, and use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) < a month, (all p < 0.05).By Logistic regression analysis, Age (p < 0.0001, odds ratio[AOR] = 1.076), hypertension (p = 0.039, AOR = 1.829), heart failure (p = 0.019, AOR = 2.448), MR (p = 0.0001, AOR = 3.110), use of ACEi <month (p = 0.043, AOR= 2.181), pump time >120 minutes (p = 0.022, AOR = 1.797), perioperative blood transfusion (p = 0.008, AOR = 2.532), and prolonged inotropic support (p = 0.012, AOR = 2.591) were significant and independent predictors of AKI. CONCLUSION:  Independent predictors of acute kidney injury following valve surgeries include age, hypertension, heart failure, MR, use of ACEi <month, perioperative blood transfusion, and prolonged pump time or inotropic support.  
Knowledge and Attitudes of Canadian Cardiac Surgeons Regarding Patients With Human Immunodeficiency Virus.  ;BACKGROUND: Current data on cardiac surgical practices for people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are lacking. We hypothesized that cardiac surgeons would consider people living with HIV as candidates for the full scope of cardiac surgery, including heart transplant for these patients. METHODS: We conducted a prospective survey of 155 cardiac surgeons across Canada to evaluate their current clinical perceptions regarding cardiac surgery in people living with HIV. Specifically, we evaluated their assessment of eligibility toward a wide scope of cardiac surgeries by using representative clinical scenarios. RESULTS: A total of 63 surgeon responses (40.6%) were completed. The majority of surgeons agreed that a 50-year-old man with HIV and no other comorbidities, who had been receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for 5 years with an undetectable viral load since starting therapy and a CD4 count greater than 350 cells/μL, would be a candidate for valve replacement (73%), valve repair surgery (74.6%), or coronary artery bypass graft surgery (79.4%). Few surgeons believed that this patient would be eligible for cardiac transplantation (7.9%) or could be a cardiac transplant donor (1.6%). There was clinical equipoise over the eligibility for ventricular assist device surgery. CONCLUSIONS: A majority of cardiac surgeons would perform coronary artery bypass graft surgery or valve surgery on patients with controlled HIV, but most consider HIV status as a prohibitive risk factor for cardiac transplantation. Although this may represent an opportunity for continuing medical education for cardiac surgeons, it also highlights the need for contemporary, high-quality evidence in this patient population.  
The effect of treated apical periodontitis before heart valve surgery on C-reactive protein levels.  ;OBJECTIVE: Dental infections produce significant increases in systemic inflammatory responses manifested by cytokines and acute-phase reactants. This study evaluated the postoperative C-reactive protein (CRP) levels according to patients having teeth treated or not treated for apical periodontitis (AP) before heart valve surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Preoperative, postoperative third- and fifth-day CRP levels, and the previous dental data of 91 patients were investigated. Whether the patients had been treated for AP and whether they used antibiotic prophylaxis for this treatment were determined by examining the previous data. The analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences in the preoperative CRP levels and the third-day CRP levels between all patients treated and those not treated for AP (p > .05). The mean fifth-day CRP levels of the patients with teeth treated for AP were significantly lower than those of the patients with teeth not treated for AP (p < .05). Antibiotic prophylaxis had a significant effect on the fifth-day CRP levels. CONCLUSION: The decrease in CRP levels after AP treatment may contribute to alleviating heart valve disease and maintaining cardiac health.  
Precise Drug Sequential Therapy Can Improve the Cardioversion Rate of Atrial Fibrillation with Valvular Disease after Radiofrequency Ablation.  ;"OBJECTIVE: Based on pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation (AF), investigate the effects of precision drugs continuous therapy on AF cardioversion rate after radiofrequency catheter ablation. METHODS: We included 1334 patients who underwent mitral valve replacement with bipolar radiofrequency ablation due to mitral valve disease with AF during June 2011 to July 2017. The data of clinical and related laboratory examinations at discharge and follow-up were recorded. All patients were treated with or without angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and angiotensin II-receptor blocker (ARB) drugs according to their conditions and doctor's willingness. The heart rhythm was evaluated after treatment and follow-up of 6 months. RESULTS: All 1162 cases were followed up, including 825 cases in mitral stenosis (MS) group, 337 cases in mitral regurgitation (MR) group. In MS group, left atrial diameter(LAD) and left ventricular diameter(LVD) of the patients taking ACEI and ARB were significantly lower (P < 0.05), and they can increase AF cardioversion rate from 79.1% of the control group to 83.7% and 82.8%, respectively (P = 0.03 and 0.04). In MR group, the patients with ACEI compared with control group, there were no significant differences in LAD, LVD, right atrial diameter (RAD), right ventricular diameter (RVD), left ventricular ejection fraction(LVEF), and left ventricular fractional shortening(LVFS) (P > 0.05); but ARB group, LAD, LVD decreased significantly (P < 0.05). And ACEI can increase AF cardioversion rate from 76.1% in the control group to 77.2% (P = 0.62), ARB to 81.6% (P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: It does improve AF cardioversion rate after radiofrequency catheter ablation that the precise anti-structural remodeling drugs continuous therapy was adopted based on the pathogenesis of AF.

Rationale, Design, and Baseline Characteristics of the BioProsthetic Valves with Atrial Fibrillation (BPV-AF) Study.  ;"PURPOSE: To date, clinical data on real-world treatment practices in Japanese patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) after bioprosthetic valve (BPV) replacement are needed. We conducted a large-scale, prospective, multicenter study to understand the actual usage of antithrombotic therapy and the incidence of thromboembolic and bleeding events in these patients, and to eliminate the clinical data gap between Japan and Western countries. METHODS: This was an observational study, in patients who had undergone BPV replacement and had a confirmed diagnosis of AF, with no mandated interventions. We report the baseline demographic and clinical data for the 899 evaluable patients at the end of the enrollment period. RESULTS: Overall, 45.7% of patients were male; the mean age was 80.3 years; AF was paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent in 36.9%, 34.6%, and 28.5% of patients, respectively. Mean risk scores for stroke and bleeding were 2.5 (CHADS2), 4.1 (CHA2DS2-VASc), and 2.5 (HAS-BLED). Many patients (76.2%) had comorbid hypertension and 54.8% had heart failure. Most BPVs (65.5%) were positioned in the aortic valve. Warfarin-based therapy, direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC)-based therapy, and antiplatelet therapy (without warfarin and DOAC) were administered to 55.0%, 29.3%, and 9.7% of patients, respectively. CONCLUSION: Patients enrolled into this study are typical of the wider Japanese AF/BPV population in terms of age and clinical history. Future data accruing from the observational period will contribute to future treatment recommendations and guide therapeutic decisions in patients with BPV and AF.

Thinner biological tissues induce leaflet flutter in aortic heart valve replacements.  ;Valvular heart disease has recently become an increasing public health concern due to the high prevalence of valve degeneration in aging populations. For patients with severely impacted aortic valves that require replacement, catheter-based bioprosthetic valve deployment offers a minimally invasive treatment option that eliminates many of the risks associated with surgical valve replacement. Although recent percutaneous device advancements have incorporated thinner, more flexible biological tissues to streamline safer deployment through catheters, the impact of such tissues in the complex, mechanically demanding, and highly dynamic valvular system remains poorly understood. The present work utilized a validated computational fluid-structure interaction approach to isolate the behavior of thinner, more compliant aortic valve tissues in a physiologically realistic system. This computational study identified and quantified significant leaflet flutter induced by the use of thinner tissues that initiated blood flow disturbances and oscillatory leaflet strains. The aortic flow and valvular dynamics associated with these thinner valvular tissues have not been previously identified and provide essential information that can significantly advance fundamental knowledge about the cardiac system and support future medical device innovation. Considering the risks associated with such observed flutter phenomena, including blood damage and accelerated leaflet deterioration, this study demonstrates the potentially serious impact of introducing thinner, more flexible tissues into the cardiac system.  
Impact of selected comorbidities on the presentation and management of aortic stenosis.  ;"BACKGROUND: Contemporary data regarding the impact of comorbidities on the clinical presentation and management of patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) are scarce. METHODS: Prospective registry of severe patients with AS across 23 centres in nine European countries. RESULTS: Of the 2171 patients, chronic kidney disease (CKD 27.3%), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <50% (22.0%), atrial fibrillation (15.9%) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (11.4%) were the most prevalent comorbidities (49.3% none, 33.9% one and 16.8% ≥2 of these). The decision to perform aortic valve replacement (AVR) was taken in a comparable proportion (67%, 72% and 69%, in patients with 0, 1 and ≥2 comorbidities; p=0.186). However, the decision for TAVI was more common with more comorbidities (35.4%, 54.0% and 57.0% for no, 1 and ≥2; p<0.001), while the decision for surgical AVR (SAVR) was decreased with increasing comorbidity burden (31.9%, 17.4% and 12.3%; p<0.001). The proportion of patients with planned AVRs that were performed within 3 months was significantly higher in patients with 1 or ≥2 comorbidities than in those without (8.7%, 10.0% and 15.7%; p<0.001). Furthermore, the mean time to AVR was significantly shorter in patients with one (30.5 days) or ≥2 comorbidities (30.8 days) than in those without (35.7 days; p=0.012). Patients with reduced LVEF tended to be offered an AVR more frequently and with a shorter delay while patients with CKD were less frequently treated. CONCLUSIONS: Comorbidities in severe patients with AS affect the presentation and management of patients with severe AS. TAVI was offered more often than SAVR and performed within a shorter time period.  "
Simulation of left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction in transcatheter mitral valve-in-ring replacement.  ;"Left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction is a feared complication of transcatheter mitral valve replacement (TMVR). This procedure leads to an elongation of LVOT in the left ventricle (namely, the neoLVOT), ultimately portending hemodynamic impairment and death. This study sought to understand the biomechanical implications of LVOT obstruction in two patients who underwent TMVR as an ""off-label"" application of the Edwards SAPIEN 3 (S3) Ultra transcatheter heart valve (THV). A computational framework of TMVR was developed to assess the neoLVOT area and quantify the sub-aortic flow structure. We observed that the annuloplasty ring serves as the key anchor zone of S3 Ultra THV. A good agreement was found between the numerically-predicted and CT-imaging measurements of neoLVOT area, with differences less than 10% in both patients. The pressure drop across the neoLVOT did not determine hemodynamic impairment in both patients. Quantification of structural and hemodynamic variables by computational modeling may facilitate more accurate predictions of the LVOT obstruction in TMVR, particularly for patients which are considered to have a borderline risk of obstruction.

TLR7 Expression Is Associated with M2 Macrophage Subset in Calcific Aortic Valve Stenosis.  ;Calcific aortic valve stenosis (CAVS) is a common age-related disease characterized by active calcification of the leaflets of the aortic valve. How innate immune cells are involved in disease pathogenesis is not clear. In this study we investigate the role of the pattern recognition receptor Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) in CAVS, especially in relation to macrophage subtype. Human aortic valves were used for mRNA expression analysis, immunofluorescence staining, or ex vivo tissue assays. Response to TLR7 agonist in primary macrophages and valvular interstitial cells (VICs) were investigated in vitro. In the aortic valve, TLR7 correlated with M2 macrophage markers on mRNA levels. Expression was higher in the calcified part compared with the intermediate and healthy parts. TLR7+ cells were co-stained with M2-type macrophage receptors CD163 and CD206. Ex vivo stimulation of valve tissue with the TLR7 ligand imiquimod significantly increased secretion of IL-10, TNF-α, and GM-CSF. Primary macrophages responded to imiquimod with increased secretion of IL-10 while isolated VICs did not respond. In summary, in human aortic valves TLR7 expression is associated with M2 macrophages markers. Ex vivo tissue challenge with TLR7 ligand led to secretion of immunomodulatory cytokine IL-10. These results connect TLR7 activation in CAVS to reduced inflammation and improved clearance.  
Impact of Incomplete Coronary Revascularization on Late Ischemic and Bleeding Events after Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.  ;BACKGROUND: The impact of coronary artery disease (CAD) and revascularization by percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) on prognosis in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) remain debated. A dismal prognosis in patients undergoing PCI has been associated with elevated baseline SYNTAX score (bSS) and residual SYNTAX score (rSS). The objective was to investigate whether the degree of bSS and rSS impacted ischemic and bleeding events after TAVR. METHODS: bSS and rSS were calculated in 311 patients admitted for TAVR. The primary outcome was the occurrence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE), a composite endpoint of myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiovascular death, or rehospitalization for heart failure. The occurrence of late major/life-threatening bleeding complications (MLBCs) and each primary endpoint individually were the secondary endpoints. RESULTS: bSS > 22 was associated with higher occurrence of MACE (p = 0.013). rSS > 8 and bSS > 22 had no impact on overall cardiovascular mortality. rSS > 8 and bSS > 22 were associated with higher rates of myocardial infarction (p = 0.001 and p = 0.004) and late occurrence of MLBCs. Multivariate analysis showed that bSS > 22 (sHR 2.48) and rSS > 8 (sHR 2.35) remained predictors of MLBCs but not of myocardial infarction. CONCLUSIONS: Incomplete coronary revascularization and CAD burden did not impact overall and cardiac mortality but constitute predictors of late MLBCs in TAVR patients.  
Platelet Count Drop After Rapid Deployment Aortic Valve Implantation.  ;"BACKGROUND: A transient postoperative drop in platelet count is an expected finding after aortic valve replacement using extracorporeal circulation. The implantation of the Perceval valve has been associated with a more intense drop of platelet count compared to other bio-prostheses. This study analyses and compares the platelets progression associated with the Perceval and Intuity valves. METHODS: The data was collected retrospectively for patients submitted to isolated aortic valve replacement with the Perceval valve (80 patients) and the Intuity valve (141 patients) in our institution between March 2014 and December 2018. The groups were further divided into those who receive platelet transfusion and those who did not. RESULTS: The minimum values of platelet count were 54% and 67% of the preoperative platelet count in the patients treated with a Perceval and an Intuity valves, respectively (p<0.001). In the patients transfused with platelets, the minimum values were 52% and 79% of the preoperative platelet count, respectively (p<0.01). Recovery of the count was faster in the patients treated with an Intuity valve. Abnormal bleeding and transfusion of packed red blood cells were not significantly different between groups (without platelet transfusion: p=0.71 and p=0.99, respectively; with platelet transfusion: p=0.58 and p=0.99, respectively). CONCLUSION: Compared to the Intuity valve, the Perceval valve is associated with a transient, but significant, drop in platelet count. This drop was not associated to an increased risk of bleeding. Platelet transfusion, in this setting, should be judicious and not only ruled by absolute values.  "
Use of vertebral left atrial size for staging of dogs with myxomatous valve disease.  ;"INTRODUCTION/OBJECTIVES: The American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine (ACVIM) guidelines suggest that pimobendan should be initiated in dogs which meet all criteria of stage B2 myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD): murmur intensity ≥ 3/6, left atrial-to-aortic ratio ≥ 1.6, normalized left ventricular internal diameter in diastole ≥ 1.7, and vertebral heart size > 10.5. Recently, a new radiographic index for left atrial enlargement, vertebral left atrial size (VLAS), was proposed. The objective of the present study was to evaluate whether VLAS is useful in staging MMVD and if it can distinguish between ACVIM stages B1 and B2. ANIMALS: Ninety-seven client-owned dogs with MMVD were evaluated and classified as ACVIM stage B1, B2, or C-D. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The echocardiographs and radiographs of all the dogs were retrospectively evaluated to obtain left atrial-to-aortic ratio, normalized left ventricular internal diameter in diastole, and VLAS values. The data were analyzed to assess the correlation between these measurements and VLAS, and the optimal cutoff value of VLAS was determined. RESULTS: A VLAS cutoff value of 2.6 provided the greatest diagnostic accuracy for identification of dogs with ACVIM stage B2 MMVD (area under the curve, 0.96; sensitivity, 95%; specificity, 84%). A VLAS ≥2.5 exhibited the highest sensitivity (sensitivity, 100%; specificity, 78%), and a VLAS ≥ 3.1 exhibited the highest specificity (sensitivity, 47%; specificity, 100%). CONCLUSIONS: VLAS is a helpful index for monitoring MMVD using radiography. A VLAS cutoff value of 2.5 could be used to identify dogs that may benefit from echocardiography to determine if they have reached ACVIM stage B2.  "
Infective endocarditis after TAVI: a meta-analysis and systematic review of epidemiology, risk factors and clinical consequences.  ;Infective endocarditis (IE) represents one of the most challenging clinical entities, requiring a multidisciplinary approach. The increasing number of surgical and transcatheter heart valves replacements performed annually lead to a higher incidence of prosthetic valve endocarditis. Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) brought a new alternative for the treatment of aortic stenosis and a new subgroup of IE with its features. We aimed to compare the incidence of IE in TAVI and surgical valve replacement (SAVR) to identify risk factors for TAVI-IE, evaluate the possible impact on mortality, and clarify the best treatment strategies. A digital scan in PubMed and SCOPUS databases was performed. 68 publications were selected to perform a meta-analysis and systematic review on epidemiology, risk factors, and mortality predictors in TAVI-IE. No significant difference in IE rate was noted between patients with TAVI and those with SAVR for in-hospital, early, mid-term and late IE. Male gender, intubation, new pacemaker implantation IE and CKD were correlated with TAVI-IE. Surgical treatment was performed in 22.3% of cases. Overall mortality for the pooled cohort was 38.3%. In a multivariate logistic regression model, surgical treatment and self-expandable device were linked to lower mortality in TAVI-IE. Even if the invasive procedure can trigger bacteremia, exposing the TAVI valve to future infection, no significant difference in IE rate was noted in our analysis between patients with TAVI and those with SAVR for in-hospital, early, mid-term and late IE. Surgical treatment of TAVI-IE can be a viable option in patients with a prohibitive risk score.  
Hemodynamics in Adults With the Shone Complex.  ;Patients with Shone complex (SC) have multiple left-sided obstructive lesions and thus are at risk for left ventricular (LV) remodeling, LV diastolic dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension. Yet, to date, there has been no description of hemodynamics in adults with SC. Retrospective chart review of 25 patients with SC who underwent cardiac catheterization at Mayo Clinic, MN between 2002 and 2019 was performed. SC was defined as multiple left-sided obstructive lesions in the presence of an anatomically abnormal mitral valve. Median age was 32 years (22.5, 42) and 15 patients (60%) were female. The majority of patients (84%) had history of coarctation of the aorta, 10 (40%) had subaortic stenosis, 11 (44%) had prior aortic valve replacement, and 10 (40%) had prior mitral valve replacement. Structural disease at the time of catheterization which warranted intervention within the next year was present in 13 patients (52%). The mean LV end-diastolic pressure was 21.3 ± 9.0 mm Hg (>15 mm Hg in 71%), pulmonary artery peak systolic pressure was 55.4 ± 13.4 mm Hg, and the pulmonary artery mean pressure was 37.0 ± 9.4 mm Hg (>20 mm Hg in 96%). During a mean follow-up of 8.3 ± 4.4 years, there were 7 deaths (28%) and 3 additional patients (12%) underwent cardiac transplantation. In conclusion, adults with SC who underwent catheterization showed significant left-sided heart and pulmonary vascular remodeling. Elevated LV end-diastolic pressure and pulmonary artery pressures were highly prevalent. There were high mortality and cardiac transplant rates in our cohort.  
Canine infantile left ventricular noncompaction.  ;BACKGROUND: Left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC) is a rare form of cardiomyopathy currently described in humans and cats. It consists of a spongy myocardium characterized by prominent trabeculation and deep recesses involving more than 50% of the ventricular thickness. We describe the clinical and pathological features of LVNC combined with tricuspid valve dysplasia, double-orifice tricuspid valve and severe pulmonary stenosis in a puppy. In addition, we briefly review the LVNC causes, pathogenesis, forms and current diagnostic criteria. CASE PRESENTATION: A seven-week-old intact German Shorthaired Pointer-cross male was presented with a poor body condition, exercise intolerance and dyspnea. Clinical exam identified a bilateral systolic murmur (grade IV/VI over the right heart base and grade III/VI over the left heart base). Echocardiography identified tricuspid valve dysplasia, mild mitral regurgitation, and severe pulmonic stenosis with a trans-valvar systolic pressure gradient of 106 mmHg. Left ventricular noncompaction was diagnosed by necropsy and further confirmed histopathologically by the presence of two distinct myocardial layers: an inner noncompacted zone covering more than 50% of ventricular thickness containing prominent trabeculation and deep recesses, and an outer zone of compact myocardium. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first case describing LVNC in a canine patient, supporting the introduction of this form of heart disease as a differential diagnosis for cardiomyopathies in juvenile and adult dogs.  
Cluster analysis for the identification of clinical phenotypes among antiphospholipid antibody-positive patients from the APS ACTION Registry.  ;"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to use cluster analysis (CA) to identify different clinical phenotypes among antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL)-positive patients. METHODS: The Alliance for Clinical Trials and International Networking (APS ACTION) Registry includes persistently positive aPL of any isotype based on the Sydney antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) classification criteria. We performed CA on the baseline characteristics collected retrospectively at the time of the registry entry of the first 500 patients included in the registry. A total of 30 clinical data points were included in the primary CA to cover the broad spectrum of aPL-positive patients. RESULTS: A total of 497 patients from international centres were analysed, resulting in three main exclusive clusters: (a) female patients with no other autoimmune diseases but with venous thromboembolism (VTE) and triple-aPL positivity; (b) female patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, VTE, aPL nephropathy, thrombocytopaenia, haemolytic anaemia and a positive lupus anticoagulant test; and (c) older men with arterial thrombosis, heart valve disease, livedo, skin ulcers, neurological manifestations and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our hierarchical cluster analysis, we identified different clinical phenotypes of aPL-positive patients discriminated by aPL profile, lupus or CVD risk factors. Our results, while supporting the heterogeneity of aPL-positive patients, also provide a foundation to understand disease mechanisms, create new approaches for APS classification and ultimately develop new management approaches.

Identification of key genes in calcific aortic valve disease by integrated bioinformatics analysis.  ;Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is highly prevalent in our aging world and has no effective pharmaceutical treatment. Intense efforts have been made but the underlying molecular mechanisms of CAVD are still unclear.This study was designed to identify the critical genes and pathways in CAVD by bioinformatics analysis. Microarray datasets of GSE12644, GSE51472, and GSE83453 were obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified and functional and pathway enrichment analysis was performed. Subsequently, the protein-protein interaction network (PPI) was constructed with Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes and was visualized with Cytoscape to identify the most significant module. Hub genes were identified by Cytoscape plugin cytoHubba.A total of 179 DEGs, including 101 upregulated genes and 78 downregulated genes, were identified. The enriched functions and pathways of the DEGs include inflammatory and immune response, chemotaxis, extracellular matrix (ECM) organization, complement and coagulation cascades, ECM receptor interaction, and focal adhesion. The most significant module in the PPI network was analyzed and genes among it were mainly enriched in chemotaxis, locomotory behavior, immune response, chemokine signaling pathway, and extracellular space. In addition, DEGs, with degrees ≥ 10 and the top 10 highest Maximal Chique Centrality (MCC) score, were identified as hub genes. CCR1, MMP9, VCAM1, and ITGAX, which were of the highest degree or MCC score, were manually reviewed.The DEGs and hub genes identified in the present study help us understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of CAVD and might serve as candidate therapeutic targets for CAVD.  
Association of baseline kidney disease with outcomes of transcatheter mitral valve repair by MitraClip.  ;"OBJECTIVES: This study sought to determine the impact of baseline chronic kidney disease (CKD) on in-hospital outcomes of transcatheter mitral valve repair with MitraClip (MC). BACKGROUND: MC is now an established treatment in high surgical risk patients. However, limited data are available on outcomes of MC in patients with baseline renal dysfunction. METHODS: The authors used data from January 2014 to December 2017 National Readmission Database to identify all patients ≥18 years of age who underwent MC. International classification of diseases (ICD)-9 and ICD-10 codes were used to identify patients with no-CKD, CKD (without chronic dialysis), or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis. Multivariable logistic regression models were constructed using generalized estimating equations to examine in-hospital outcomes. RESULTS: Of 13,563 patients undergoing MC, 8,935 (65.8%) had no-CKD, 4,152 (30.6%) had CKD, and 476 (3.5%) had ESRD. ESRD patients compared to CKD and no-CKD had significantly higher mortality (7.2% vs. 2.5% vs. 2.0%; p < .001), higher incidence of bleeding, blood transfusions, and 30 day all cause readmission. CKD patients compared to no-CKD had significantly higher mortality (odds ratio-1.29; CI 1.01-1.65; p = .04), acute kidney injury (odds ratio-3.0; CI 2.69-3.34; p < .001), new in-hospital hemodialysis (odds ratio- 2.70; CI 1.57-4.62; p < .001), blood transfusions, 30 day all cause and congestive heart failure (CHF) readmissions. In-hospital stroke and cardiac tamponade did not differ between the three groups. Patients with baseline kidney disease undergoing MC had higher mortality at high volume centers compared to low volume centers. CHF was the most common cause of readmission postMC in patients with or without preprocedural kidney disease. CONCLUSION: Patients with baseline kidney disease have worse outcomes after MC with higher readmission rates requiring careful patient selection and follow up in this population.  "
Hemodynamic performance of the balloon-expandable SAPIEN 3 valve as assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance.  ;BACKGROUND: Scarce data exist on transcatheter heart valve (THV) performance evaluated by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) in newer generation THV patients. Furthermore, it has been suggested that echocardiographic evaluation after TAVR may inaccurately assess residual AR in some patients. This study aimed to determine the incidence and severity of aortic regurgitation (AR) assessed by CMR in patients undergoing TAVR with the SAPIEN 3 valve, and evaluate the agreement between CMR and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) on the assessment of AR severity in such patients. METHODS: This multicentric observational study included 146 SAPIEN 3 patients with TTE and CMR within the month following their procedure. According to the CMR regurgitation fraction (RF), AR was considered mild and moderate-severe if the RF was 15-<30% and ≥ 30%, respectively. TTE exams followed VARC-2 recommendations. RESULTS: By CMR, SAPIEN 3 recipients displayed a mean RF of 5.0 ± 6.1%, and mild and moderate-severe AR rates of 3.4% and 0.7%, respectively. The agreement between CMR-TTE was modest (weighted κ = 0.2640, p<0.001), due to an overestimation of AR severity by TTE. A historical cohort of 139 SAPIEN XT patients with a post-procedure CMR, displayed a mean RF of 9.6 ± 10.7% and mild and moderate-severe AR rates of 18.7% and 3.6%, respectively (p < .001 vs. SAPIEN 3 group). CONCLUSIONS: SAPIEN 3 recipients exhibited very low rates of residual AR by CMR, suggesting a surgical-like performance regarding AR with this newer generation THV. TTE tended to overestimate the severity of AR, particularly among mild AR patients.  
Evaluation of static ulcer on lower extremities using wireless wearable near-infrared spectroscopy device: Effect of deep venous thrombosis on TRiggered Angiography Non-Contrast-Enhanced sequence magnetic resonance imaging.  ;BACKGROUND: Venous leg ulcers, or static leg ulcers, are chronic wounds associated with ambulatory venous hypertension of the lower extremities as a consequence of venous valve reflux, reduce venous capacitance, poor calf venous pump, heart failure, or in conjunction with venous obstruction. A static ulcer with venous thrombosis in a pelvic or thigh vein responds favorably to anticoagulation agents. However, anticoagulation is less effective and even harmful when ambulatory venous hypertension has another cause such as venous reflux, poorly heart function, and poor calf venous pump. METHOD: TRiggered Angiography Non-Contrast-Enhanced (TRANCE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) exploits differences in vascular signal intensity during the cardiac cycle for subsequent image subtraction, providing detailed radiation-free venograms without the use of contrast agents. The method is a new tool for evaluating the presence of thrombosis in the venous systems. TRANCE-MRI was employed to document the existence of venous thrombosis within the eight patients in this study. Subsequently, we used a wireless wearable near-infrared spectroscopy device to compare deep vein thrombosis-associated and non-deep vein thrombosis-associated static ulcers. The sampling depths were 5 and 10 mm, representing the dermis and subcutaneous tissue, respectively. RESULT: There are four patients with venous leg ulcers proven with venous thrombosis by TRANCE-MRI and are classified as deep vein thrombosis group. Compared with the non-deep vein thrombosis group, the deep vein thrombosis group had less deoxyhemoglobin, less total hemoglobin, and a significantly lower H2O signal in the 5-mm sampling depth (dermis level). And eight health participants were included as control group. Wounded patients (including deep vein thrombosis and non-deep vein thrombosis patients) have higher H2O concentration on the 5-mm depth sampling than control group. In the 10-mm sampling depth (subcutaneous level), the deoxyhemoglobin and tissue oxygen saturation of the deep vein thrombosis group were lower than those of the non-deep vein thrombosis group, and the H2O concentration was higher than non-deep vein thrombosis group. Patients with static foot ulcers and deep vein thrombosis had similar oxyhemoglobin, deoxyhemoglobin, total hemoglobin, and tissue oxygen saturation than did those without deep vein thrombosis in 5-mm depth sampling (dermis level). Notably, the H2O signal of patients with non-deep vein thrombosis-associated static ulcers was higher for the 5-mm sampling depth. CONCLUSION: In patients with static ulcers and deep vein thrombosis, the H2O level may be higher in the 10-mm sampling depth, indicating that those patients had more subcutaneous water. In patients with non-deep vein thrombosis static foot ulcer, the near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) indicated worse fluid retention in the dermis level. The H2O value in the NIRS may be different owing to underline the cause of the venous leg ulcers.  
Management of Non-criteria Manifestations in Antiphospholipid Syndrome.  ;PURPOSE OF THE REVIEW: To review the available evidence on the management of a variety of non-criteria manifestations in antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), including valvular disease, alveolar hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, APS nephropathy, skin ulcers, livedo reticularis, cognitive dysfunction, and epilepsy. RECENT FINDINGS: Current treatment relies on low-level evidence and mainly on expert consensus due to the rarity and the heterogeneity of non-criteria APS manifestations and the diversity in management approaches. Conventional anticoagulation and/or antiplatelet APS treatment do not adequately control most of non-criteria manifestations. Increasing knowledge about the contribution of inflammatory in addition to, or independently of, thrombotic mechanisms in non-criteria APS manifestations provides insight into the potential effect of novel therapies targeting B-cells, mammalian target of rapamycin, neutrophil, and complement or interferon pathways. Existing evidence is limited by lack of high-quality studies. Better understanding of the pathophysiology and clinical phenotypes of APS and well-designed prospective studies of homogenous populations are needed to provide evidence-based recommendations for the management of non-criteria APS manifestations.  
Tri-Valvular Endocarditis in a Previously Normal Heart Misdiagnosed as Recurrent Valley Fever.  ;"Infective endocarditis (IE) is classified as an infection of any cardiac valve or endocardial surface. This condition is associated with high morbidity and mortality; hence, early diagnosis and rapid intervention are extremely vital. Although IE is frequently found to infect only one heart valve, rare instances have shown multi-valvular involvement. Many conditions can present similar to IE, often delaying the diagnosis of IE. Coccidioidomycosis (or Valley Fever), a fungal infection endemic in the Southwestern United States, can present with features analogous to those of IE. We present the case of a middle-aged male with no underlying structural heart disease found to have tri-valvular IE after being misdiagnosed with recurrent Valley Fever.  "
Reconstruction of right ventricular outflow tract stenosis and right ventricular failure after Ross procedure - comprehensive assessment of adult congenital heart disease with four-dimensional imaging: a case report.  ;BACKGROUND: Re-intervention after Ross procedure into the right ventricular outflow tract might be needed in patients in the long term. However, right ventricular outflow tract re-intervention indications are still unclear. Comprehensive assessment of total hemodynamics is needed. A 42-year-old Japanese woman was referred to our hospital for moderately severe pulmonary regurgitation and severe tricuspid regurgitation after a Ross-Konno procedure. Thirteen years after surgery, she developed atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter and complained of dyspnea. Electrophysiological studies showed re-entry circuit around the low voltage area of the lateral wall on the right atrium. Four-dimensional flow magnetic resonance imaging revealed moderate pulmonary regurgitation, severe tricuspid regurgitation, and a dilated right ventricle. Flow energy loss in right ventricle calculated from four-dimensional flow magnetic resonance imaging was five times higher than in normal controls, suggesting an overload of the right-sided heart system. Her left ventricular ejection fraction was almost preserved. Moreover, the total left interventricular pressure difference, which shows diastolic function, revealed that her sucking force in left ventricle was preserved. After the comprehensive assessments, we performed right ventricular outflow tract reconstruction, tricuspid valve annuloplasty, and right-side Maze procedure. A permanent pacemaker with a single atrial lead was implanted 14 days postoperatively. She was discharged 27 days postoperatively. Echocardiography performed 3 months later showed that the size of the dilated right ventricle had significantly reduced. DISCUSSION: A four-dimensional imaging tool can be useful in the decision of re-operation in patients with complex adult congenital heart disease. The optimal timing of surgery should be considered comprehensively.  
The modified MIDA-Score predicts mid-term outcomes after interventional therapy of functional mitral regurgitation.  ;"AIMS: The preprocedural assessment of outcomes and patients' prognosis after interventional therapy of functional MR (FMR) is uncertain. Therefore, we aim to develop an easy-to-handle scoring system for adequate prediction of individual outcomes in patients with FMR after the interventional treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively used medical data of patients with symptomatic FMR, who underwent transcatheter mitral valve repair (TMVR) from January 2014 to August 2016 in our heart center. All patients had the mean follow-up of 18 months. All clinical and echocardiographic data originate from the ""Bonner Mitral Valve Register Database"". RESULTS: We included 105 patients (76,7±8,8 years, 50,6% female) with symptomatic (NYHA functional class>II) moderate-to-severe or severe FMR at surgical high-risk. We modified the MIDA-Score for degenerative MR (DMR) according to the varying underlying pathomechanisms of FMR, called as ""The modified MIDA Score"". We found all-cause mortality of 7% within 18 months after the procedure. 34,1% of our cohort was rehospitalized; 90% of those were due to cardiovascular causes. The modified MIDA score was found to be a strong predictor for mortality and rehospitalization in patients with FMR (AUC: 0,89) and superior to the other conventional scoring systems in prediction of mortality (The modified MIDA-Score: AUC: 0,8, EuroSCORE II: AUC: 0,57, STS-Score: AUC: 0,51). The logistic regression analysis showed the modified MIDA score > 9 points to be the strongest predictor for mortality and rehospitalization after TMVR (OR: 3,35, p = 0,011). CONCLUSION: The modified MIDA score was found to be a promising, easy-to-handle, elementary scoring system for adequate prediction of individual postinterventional prognosis in patients with FMR undergoing TMVR. Further evaluation and validation of this novel scoring system in prospective multicentric studies with a large number of patients is warranted.  "
Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation Represents an Anti-Inflammatory Therapy Via Reduction of Shear Stress-Induced, Piezo-1-Mediated Monocyte Activation.  ;BACKGROUND: Aortic valve stenosis is an increasingly prevalent degenerative and inflammatory disease. Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has revolutionized its treatment, thereby avoiding its life-threatening/disabling consequences. Whether aortic valve stenosis is accelerated by inflammation and whether it is itself a cause of inflammation are unclear. We hypothesized that the large shear forces exerted on circulating cells, particularly on the largest circulating cells, monocytes, while passing through stenotic aortic valves result in proinflammatory effects that are resolved with TAVI. METHODS: TAVI provides a unique opportunity to compare the activation status of monocytes under high shear stress (before TAVI) and under low shear stress (after TAVI). The activation status of monocytes was determined with a single-chain antibody, MAN-1, which is specific for the activated β2-integrin Mac-1. Monocyte function was further characterized by the adhesion of myocytes to stimulated endothelial cells, phagocytic activity, uptake of oxidized low-density lipoprotein, and cytokine expression. In addition, we designed a microfluidic system to recapitulate the shear rate conditions before and after TAVI. We used this tool in combination with functional assays, Ca2+ imaging, siRNA gene silencing, and pharmacological agonists and antagonists to identify the key mechanoreceptor mediating the shear stress sensitivity of monocytes. Last, we stained for monocytes in explanted stenotic aortic human valves. RESULTS: The resolution of high shear stress through TAVI reduces Mac-1 activation, cellular adhesion, phagocytosis, oxidized low-density lipoprotein uptake, and expression of inflammatory markers in monocytes and plasma. Using microfluidics and pharmacological and genetic studies, we could recapitulate high shear stress effects on isolated human monocytes under highly controlled conditions, showing that shear stress-dependent calcium influx and monocyte adhesion are mediated by the mechanosensitive ion channel Piezo-1. We also demonstrate that the expression of this receptor is shear stress dependent and downregulated in patients receiving TAVI. Last, we show monocyte accumulation at the aortic side of leaflets of explanted aortic valves. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that high shear stress, as present in patients with aortic valve stenosis, activates multiple monocyte functions, and we identify Piezo-1 as the mainly responsible mechanoreceptor, representing a potentially druggable target. We demonstrate an anti-inflammatory effect and therefore a novel therapeutic benefit of TAVI.

Elastin-Based Materials: Promising Candidates for Cardiac Tissue Regeneration.  ;Stroke and cardiovascular episodes are still some of the most common diseases worldwide, causing millions of deaths and costing billions of Euros to healthcare systems. The use of new biomaterials with enhanced biological and physical properties has opened the door to new approaches in cardiovascular applications. Elastin-based materials are biomaterials with some of the most promising properties. Indeed, these biomaterials have started to yield good results in cardiovascular and angiogenesis applications. In this review, we explore the latest trends in elastin-derived materials for cardiac regeneration and the different possibilities that are being explored by researchers to regenerate an infarcted muscle and restore its normal function. Elastin-based materials can be processed in different manners to create injectable systems or hydrogel scaffolds that can be applied by simple injection or as patches to cover the damaged area and regenerate it. Such materials have been applied to directly regenerate the damaged cardiac muscle and to create complex structures, such as heart valves or new bio-stents that could help to restore the normal function of the heart or to minimize damage after a stroke. We will discuss the possibilities that elastin-based materials offer in cardiac tissue engineering, either alone or in combination with other biomaterials, in order to illustrate the wide range of options that are being explored. Moreover, although tremendous advances have been achieved with such elastin-based materials, there is still room for new approaches that could trigger advances in cardiac tissue regeneration.  
An unusual case of redo tricuspid valve replacement and repair of a previously unidentified anomalous pulmonary venous return in a patient with congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries.  ;Associated cardiovascular malformations in congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries (CCTGA) should not be missed when a patient requires surgical correction. We present a case of an adult CCTGA patient who required redo surgery for recurrent tricuspid (left atrioventricular) valve regurgitation and previously unidentified partial anomalous pulmonary venous return.  
Rationale and design of PROACT Xa: A randomized, multicenter, open-label, clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of apixaban versus warfarin in patients with a mechanical On-X Aortic Heart Valve.  ;Vitamin K antagonists are the only approved oral anticoagulants for long-term prophylaxis against valve thrombosis and thromboembolism in patients with a mechanical heart valve. Despite the proven efficacy and safety of anticoagulation with the oral direct factor Xa inhibitor apixaban compared with warfarin in high-risk populations including subjects with atrial fibrillation or with venous thromboembolism, it remains unknown whether patients with a mechanical heart valve can be safely managed with apixaban. The On-X Aortic Heart Valve and On-X Ascending Aortic Prosthesis with the Vascutek Gelweave Valsalva Graft may have lower rates of valve thrombosis and thromboembolism than conventional bileaflet and tilting disc valves due its unique pyrolytic carbon composition and flared inlet design. DESIGN: PROACT Xa is a randomized, multicenter, open-label, active-controlled trial comparing apixaban with warfarin in patients with an On-X Aortic Heart Valve or On-X Ascending Aortic Prosthesis with the Vascutek Gelweave Valsalva Graft. The study will randomize approximately 1,000 patients from approximately 60 sites in North America who underwent aortic valve replacement at least 3 months prior. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to receiving apixaban 5 mg twice daily or warfarin with a target international normalized ratio of 2.0-3.0. The last randomized participant will be followed for at least 2 years. The primary efficacy outcome is the composite of valve thrombosis and valve-related thromboembolism, and the primary safety outcome is major bleeding. Assuming the primary outcome occurs in warfarin-anticoagulated patients at a rate of 1.75%/patient-year, the study has more than 90% power to assess noninferiority of apixaban treatment with an absolute noninferiority margin of 1.75%/patient-year. A second co-primary analysis is to compare the hazard rate for the apixaban arm to twice the objective performance criterion for thromboembolism and valve thrombosis, that is, 3.4%/patient-year. SUMMARY: PROACT Xa will determine whether patients with an On-X Aortic Heart Valve can be anticoagulated with apixaban as an alternative to warfarin.  
Perioperative Cardiovascular Risk Assessment and Management for Noncardiac Surgery: A Review.  ;"IMPORTANCE: Perioperative cardiovascular complications occur in 3% of hospitalizations for noncardiac surgery in the US. This review summarizes evidence regarding cardiovascular risk assessment prior to noncardiac surgery. OBSERVATIONS: Preoperative cardiovascular risk assessment requires a focused history and physical examination to identify signs and symptoms of ischemic heart disease, heart failure, and severe valvular disease. Risk calculators, such as the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, identify individuals with low risk (<1%) and higher risk (≥1%) for perioperative major adverse cardiovascular events during the surgical hospital admission or within 30 days of surgery. Cardiovascular testing is rarely indicated in patients at low risk for major adverse cardiovascular events. Stress testing may be considered in patients at higher risk (determined by the inability to climb ≥2 flights of stairs, which is <4 metabolic equivalent tasks) if the results from the testing would change the perioperative medical, anesthesia, or surgical approaches. Routine coronary revascularization does not reduce perioperative risk and should not be performed without specific indications independent of planned surgery. Routine perioperative use of low-dose aspirin (100 mg/d) does not decrease cardiovascular events but does increase surgical bleeding. Statins are associated with fewer postoperative cardiovascular complications and lower mortality (1.8% vs 2.3% without statin use; P < .001) in observational studies, and should be considered preoperatively in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease undergoing vascular surgery. High-dose β-blockers (eg, 100 mg of metoprolol succinate) administered 2 to 4 hours prior to surgery are associated with a higher risk of stroke (1.0% vs 0.5% without β-blocker use; P = .005) and mortality (3.1% vs 2.3% without β-blocker use; P = .03) and should not be routinely used. There is a greater risk of perioperative myocardial infarction and major adverse cardiovascular events in adults aged 75 years or older (9.5% vs 4.8% for younger adults; P < .001) and in patients with coronary stents (8.9% vs 1.5% for those without stents; P < .001) and these patients warrant careful preoperative consideration. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Comprehensive history, physical examination, and assessment of functional capacity during daily life should be performed prior to noncardiac surgery to assess cardiovascular risk. Cardiovascular testing is rarely indicated in patients with a low risk of major adverse cardiovascular events, but may be useful in patients with poor functional capacity (<4 metabolic equivalent tasks) undergoing high-risk surgery if test results would change therapy independent of the planned surgery. Perioperative medical therapy should be prescribed based on patient-specific risk.  "
Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura is strongly associated with higher prevalence of aortic valve disease.  ;"Aortic valve disease (AVD) has similarities to atherosclerosis in the case of aortic stenosis. The important role of platelet in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis is known. The goal of this study is to evaluate whether platelet disorders play any role in aortic valve disease. We used patients with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) for this study. We evaluated any association between ITP and AVD using a large inpatient database. The International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, and Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes for ITP and AVD from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database were used for this study. Uni- and multivariate analyses were performed on data from 2002 to 2011 to evaluate any association between ITP and AVD. In the 2002 database, AVD was present in 1.73% of ITP patients versus 1.12% in the control population (odds ratio [OR], 1.56; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.34-1.81; p < 0.001). In the 2011 database, AVD was present in 1.96% of ITP patients versus 1.33% in the control population (OR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.30-1.68; p < 0.001). ITP remained independently associated with AVD following a multivariate logistic regression analysis adjusting for age, gender, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia in 2002 (OR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.16-1.57; p < 0.001) with a trend of this association in 2011 (OR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.98-1.27; p = 0.096). ITP was strongly associated with AVD over the 10-year period analyzed in a large inpatient database. The reason for this association is not known warranting further investigations.  "
COVID-19 Pandemic: Global Impact and Potential Implications for Cardiovascular Disease in Canada.  ;"BACKGROUND: The literature indicates that cardiovascular disease (CVD; including stroke), older age, and availability of health care resources affect COVID-19 case fatality rates (CFRs). The cumulative effect of COVID-19 CFRs in global CVD populations and the extrapolated effect on access to health care services in the CVD population in Canada are not fully known. In this study we explored the relationships of factors that might affect COVID-19 CFRs and estimated the potential indirect effects of COVID-19 on Canadian health care resources. METHODS: Country-level epidemiological data were analyzed to study the correlation, main effect, and interaction between COVID-19 CFRs and: (1) the proportion of the population with CVD; (2) the proportion of the population 65 years of age or older; and (3) the availability of essential health services as defined by the World Health Organization Universal Health Coverage index. For indirect implications on health care resources, estimates of the volume of postponed coronary artery bypass grafting, percutaneous coronary intervention, and valve surgeries in Ontario were calculated. RESULTS: Positive correlations were found between COVID-19 CFRs and: (1) the proportion of the population with CVD (ρ = 0.40; P = 0.001); (2) the proportion of the population 65 years of age or older (ρ = 0.43; P = 0.0005); and (3) Universal Health Coverage index (ρ = 0.27; P = 0.03). For every 1% increase in the proportion of the population 65 years of age or older or proportion of the population with CVD, the COVID-19 CFR was 9% and 19% higher, respectively. Approximately 1252 procedures would be postponed monthly in Ontario because of current public health measures. CONCLUSIONS: Countries with more prevalent CVD reported higher COVID-19 CFRs. Strain on health care resources is likely in Canada.  "

Heart team approach in treatment of mitral regurgitation: patient selection and outcome.  ;OBJECTIVE: A multidisciplinary heart valve team is recommended for the evaluation of treatment in patients with valvular heart disease, but evidence supporting this concept is lacking. In patients with severe mitral regurgitation, we thought to analyse the patient selection process by the heart team for different treatment options and the outcome after treatment. METHODS: In this single-centre cohort study, all patients treated for mitral regurgitation between July 2013 and September 2018 were included. Primary end points during follow-up were all-cause mortality and a combined end point, consisting of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular rehospitalisation and mitral valve reintervention. RESULTS: 179 patients (44.8%) were treated using Mitraclip, 185 (46.2%) by surgical repair and 36 (9.0%) by surgical replacement. The mortality risk according to EuroScore II differed significantly between treatment groups (6.6%±5.6%, 1.7%±1.5% and 3.6%±2.7% for Mitraclip, surgical repair and replacement, respectively, p<0.001). In-hospital mortality for the 3 groups were 3.4%, 1.6% and 8.3%, respectively (p=0.091). Overall, surgical repair patients had higher 4-year survival (HR 0.40 (95% CI 0.26 to 0.63), p<0.001) and fewer combined end points (HR 0.51 (95% CI 0.32 to 0.80), p<0.001) compared with surgical replacement and Mitraclip patients. However, patients undergoing Mitraclip for isolated, primary mitral regurgitation achieved very good long-term survival. CONCLUSION: The multidisciplinary heart team assigned only low-risk patients with favourable anatomy to surgical repair, while high-risk patients underwent Mitraclip or surgical replacement. This strategy was associated with lower than expected in-hospital mortality for Mitraclip patients and high 4-year survival rates for patients undergoing surgical or percutaneous repair of isolated primary mitral regurgitation.

Relationships between Physiologic and Neuropsychologic Functioning after Fontan.  ;"OBJECTIVE: To investigate potential relationships between neuropsychologic functioning and cardiac, gastroenterologic/hepatologic, and pulmonary complications in the single ventricle heart disease (SVHD) post-Fontan population. STUDY DESIGN: Following the initiation of a Fontan Multidisciplinary Clinic, patients with SVHD were evaluated systematically according to a clinical care pathway, and data from multiple subspecialty evaluations were collected prospectively from 2016 to 2019. Biomarkers of cardiology, pulmonary, and hepatology/gastroenterology functioning were abstracted, along with neuropsychologic testing results. Bivariate correlations and regression analyses examined cross-sectional relationships between physiologic predictors and neuropsychologic outcomes. RESULTS: The sample included a cohort of 68 youth with SVHD age 3-19 years, after Fontan palliation. Sleep-disordered breathing was related to poorer visual-motor integration skills (r = -0.33; P < .05) and marginally related to poorer executive functioning (r = -0.33; P = .05). Lower arterial blood oxygen content was related to poorer executive functioning (r = .45; P < .05). Greater atrioventricular valve regurgitation was related to lower parent-rated adaptive functioning (ρ = -0.34; P < .01). These results were maintained in regression analyses controlling for history of stroke and/or seizures. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated associations between neuropsychologic functioning and potentially modifiable aspects of physiologic functioning in a prospectively evaluated cohort of patients with SVHD with Fontan physiology. Our findings emphasize the importance of multidisciplinary screening and care after a Fontan procedure and suggest avenues for intervention that may improve patient outcomes and quality of life.  "

Combining statistical shape modeling, CFD, and meta-modeling to approximate the patient-specific pressure-drop across the aortic valve in real-time.  ;BACKGROUND: Advances in medical imaging, segmentation techniques, and high performance computing have stimulated the use of complex, patient-specific, three-dimensional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. Patient-specific, CFD-compatible geometries of the aortic valve are readily obtained. CFD can then be used to obtain the patient-specific pressure-flow relationship of the aortic valve. However, such CFD simulations are computationally expensive, and real-time alternatives are desired. AIM: The aim of this work is to evaluate the performance of a meta-model with respect to high-fidelity, three-dimensional CFD simulations of the aortic valve. METHODS: Principal component analysis was used to build a statistical shape model (SSM) from a population of 74 iso-topological meshes of the aortic valve. Synthetic meshes were created with the SSM, and steady-state CFD simulations at flow-rates between 50 and 650 mL/s were performed to build a meta-model. The meta-model related the statistical shape variance, and flow-rate to the pressure-drop. RESULTS: Even though the first three shape modes account for only 46% of shape variance, the features relevant for the pressure-drop seem to be captured. The three-mode shape-model approximates the pressure-drop with an average error of 8.8% to 10.6% for aortic valves with a geometric orifice area below 150 mm2 . The proposed methodology was least accurate for aortic valve areas above 150 mm2 . Further reduction to a meta-model introduces an additional 3% error. CONCLUSIONS: Statistical shape modeling can be used to capture shape variation of the aortic valve. Meta-models trained by SSM-based CFD simulations can provide an estimate of the pressure-flow relationship in real-time.  
Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion and mitral annular plane systolic excursion cardiac reference values in 1300 healthy children: Single-center results.  ;BACKGROUND: Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) and mitral annular plane systolic excursion (MAPSE) are two echocardiographic parameters which provide reliable information about the longitudinal myocardial functions of the right and left ventricles in both adult and pediatric population. The aim of this study was to determine the TAPSE and MAPSE reference values in healthy children aged 0-18 years. METHODS AND RESULTS: This prospective study included 1300 healthy children evaluated with two-dimensional echocardiography. In addition to routine echocardiographic examination, the right and left ventricular systolic functions were assessed by TAPSE and MAPSE measurements. Statistical analyses were carried out in the groups of subjects stratified according to age and body surface area. The mean and standard deviation values and z-scores of TAPSE and MAPSE were developed in each group. CONCLUSIONS: The determination of reference values for TAPSE and MAPSE in healthy children will be of guidance in the evaluation of both healthy children and those with congenital or acquired heart diseases in which the right and left ventricular systolic functions are affected. The reference values obtained will contribute to the clinical practice and the future studies.

Utility of radiographic measurements to predict echocardiographic left heart enlargement in dogs with preclinical myxomatous mitral valve disease.  ;"BACKGROUND: Evaluation of left heart size helps determine disease severity in dogs with myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD). HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: Determine the ability of radiographic vertebral heart size (VHS) and vertebral left atrial size (VLAS) to predict LHEECHO in dogs with preclinical MMVD. ANIMALS: Seventy client-owned dogs with MMVD and no historical or present clinical or radiographic evidence of congestive heart failure (CHF). METHODS: Retrospective cross-sectional study of dogs with same-day echocardiography and thoracic radiography. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to assess the ability of VHS, VLAS, and VHS + VLAS to discern dogs with and without LHEECHO , and clinically relevant cutpoints for these radiographic measurements were selected. RESULTS: The ability of VHS and VHS + VLAS to predict LHEECHO was moderate (area under the curve [AUC]VHS = 0.851; 95% CI, 0.762-0.941; AUCVHS + VLAS = 0.865; 0.783-0.947), and performance of VLAS and VHS + VLAS was not different from that of VHS alone. A VHS cutpoint of >10.8 had sensitivity = 91.1% (76.3%-98.1%) and specificity = 69.4% (51.9%-83.7%) for predicting LHEECHO . A cutpoint of >11.7 had sensitivity = 32.4% (17.4%-50.5%) and specificity = 97.2% (85.5%-99.9%) for predicting LHEECHO . Thirty (43%) of the 70 dogs had a VHS value of 10.9 to 11.7. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Vertebral heart size >11.7 identified dogs with LHEECHO and VHS ≤ 10.8 excluded dogs with LHEECHO . A large percentage of dogs had VHS values intermediate to these cutpoints.  "
Isolated Pulmonary Valve Endocarditis.  ;Infective endocarditis involving the right side of the heart is typically associated with IV drug abuse and chronic indwelling catheters which commonly involve the tricuspid valve. Isolated pulmonary valve endocarditis (PVE) is a rare clinical entity. We report a rare case of a young woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis through tunneled catheter presenting with persistent coagulase-negative staphylococcus (CoNS) epidermidis bacteremia despite being on appropriate treatment with IV vancomycin for two weeks. Because of the persistent bacteremia, a transesophageal echocardiogram was performed and it revealed a thickened pulmonary valve with 1.8 cm vegetation in the left posterior cusp. She was successfully treated with IV daptomycin course for a total of six weeks. The recommended management for PVE is usually medical treatment with IV antibiotics gauged according to sensitivities of the cultures. Our article highlights the fact that the decision to manage it medically versus surgically can propose a challenge as the guidelines are not very robust.  
Outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve replacement in cancer survivors with prior chest radiation therapy: a systematic review and meta-analysis.  ;"BACKGROUND: Cancer survivors with prior chest radiation therapy (C-XRT) frequently present with aortic stenosis (AS) as the first manifestation of radiation-induced heart disease. They are considered high-risk for surgical valve replacement. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is as an attractive option for this patient population but the outcomes are not well established in major clinical trials. The authors performed a systemic review and meta-analysis of clinical studies for the outcomes after TAVR in cancer survivors with prior C-XRT. METHODS: Online databases were searched from inception to April 2020 for studies evaluating the outcomes of TAVR in patients with and without C-XRT. We analyzed the pooled estimates (with their 95% confidence intervals) of the odds ratio (OR) for the all-cause mortality at 30-day and 1-year follow-ups, 4-point safety outcomes (stroke, major bleed, access-related vascular complications and need for a pacemaker), a 2-point efficacy outcome (mean aortic valve gradient and left ventricular ejection fraction) and worsening of congestive heart failure (CHF). Four studies were included following 2054 patients with and without prior C-XRT exposure (164 patients and 1890 patients respectively). RESULTS: The C-XRT group had similar 30-day mortality compared to the control group (OR 1.29, 95% CI 0.64 to 2.58, p = 0.48). The 1-year mortality was higher in the C-XRT group (OR 1.97, CI 1.15 to 3.39, p = 0.01). Apart from higher congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation in the C-XRT group (OR 2.03, CI 1.36 to 3.04, p = 0.0006), TAVR resulted in similar safety and efficacy outcomes in both groups. CONCLUSION: TAVR in the C-XRT group has similar 30-day mortality, safety, and efficacy outcomes compared to the control group; however, they have higher 1-year mortality and CHF exacerbation. Including an oncologist to the cardiology team who considers cancer stage in the decision-making process and applying additional preoperative scores such as frailty indices may refine the risk assessment for these patients. The quality of analyzed data is modest, warranting randomized trials to assess the true benefits of TAVR in these patients.  "
B-type Natriuretic Peptide Regulation in Patients with Severe Aortic Stenosis Following Transaortic Valvular Implantation.  ;Peri-procedural elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is also associated with worse outcomes following transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). However, the mechanism of BNP regulation in patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) remains unknown. Consecutive patients with severe AS who were referred for TAVI were enrolled in our prospective registry. BNP levels were correlated with other clinical variables. Ninety-six patients (84.7 ± 5.0 years old, 34% males) were investigated in this study. Plasma BNP averaged 353 ± 179 pg/mL. Log10 BNP had no significant correlation with severity of AS including aortic valve area and maximum flow velocity across the aortic valve (P > 0.05 for all), whereas a higher left ventricular end-diastolic dimension (LVDd) index was a significant factor associating with BNP >100 pg/mL with an odds ratio of 1.34 (95% confidence interval 1.06-1.52, P = 0.004) adjusted for several other echocardiographic parameters, with a cutoff of 30.8 mm/m2 (equivalent to LVDd 44 mm). In conclusion, among the patients with severe AS who undergo TAVI, even slight eccentric hypertrophy can cause a considerable increase in BNP level.  
Prevalence and Predictors of Atherosclerotic Peripheral Arterial Obstructive Disease in Severe Heart Valve Diseases.  ;"Despite witnessing an upsurge in heart valve diseases (HVDs), the correlation between HVDs and atherosclerotic peripheral arterial obstructive disease (PAOD) remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the prevalence and predictors of PAOD in HVDs.In this study, a total of 245 consecutive patients were examined: 153 with severe aortic valve stenosis (AS), 66 with severe primary mitral valve regurgitation (MR), and 26 with severe pure native aortic valve regurgitation (AR). All patients underwent ultrasound scan of the carotid artery to ascertain the presence of internal carotid artery stenosis (ICAS). ICAS was defined as a peak systolic velocity ≥ 125 cm/second and/or ≥ 50% reduction in diameter. In addition, we measured the ankle-brachial index in each leg using a volume plethysmograph. A result of ≤ 0.9 was considered lower extremity artery disease (LEAD).The presence of ICAS was statistically more frequent in patients with severe AS than in patients with severe MR and AR (11.1% versus 1.5% versus 3.8%; P = 0.038). LEAD was present in patients with severe AS (17.6%) and MR (10.6%) but not in patients with severe AR (P = 0.037). The multivariate analysis revealed that the presence of severe AS (OR, 5.6 [1.3-24.9]; P = 0.023) was an independent predictor for ICAS, while history of coronary artery disease (OR, 4.8 [2.2-10.5]; P < 0.001) was an independent predictor for LEAD.The prevalence of PAOD varies depending on each valvular disease. Individual screening should be considered on the basis of atherosclerotic risk factors, especially for patients with severe AS.  "
Preoperative Clinical Features and High Pulmonary Wedge Pressure with a Discordant Pattern as Prognostic Factor in Hemodialysis Patients with Severe Aortic Valve Stenosis.  ;Hemodialysis (HD) is one of the important risks for the development of cardiovascular disease, including aortic valve stenosis (AS). Although aortic valve replacement (AVR) is a beneficial treatment for AS, HD patients are known to show a high rate of mortality after AVR than non-HD patients.We retrospectively studied 109 patients who underwent AVR for severe AS, 18 of which were HD patients. Survival rate after AVR, preoperative clinical data, and surgical procedure were investigated.In preoperative clinical features, left ventricular end-diastolic diameter was larger, intraventricular septum thickness (IVST) was thicker, left ventricular mass index (LVMI) was higher, left ventricular ejection fraction was lower, E/e' was higher, and pulmonary arterial wedge pressure (PAWP) was higher in the HD group than in the non-HD group. During a follow-up period of 3.2 ± 2.3 years after AVR, patients receiving HD had a worse prognosis than those without HD treatment: the 3-year survival rate after surgery in the HD group was 36.2% and that in the non-HD group was 84.9%. With regard to prognostic factors in the whole cohort, significant differences were found in IVST, LVMI, E/e', PAWP, and HD. In patients receiving HD, abnormally high PAWP for their right atrial pressure (RAP) was observed, suggesting that PAWP and RAP were discordant, and univariate analysis revealed that high PAWP was the only predictor of mortality in HD patients after surgery.Preoperative PAWP with a discordant pattern in HD patients might be an important prognostic predictor after AVR.  
General Anesthesia or Conscious Sedation for Transfemoral Aortic Valve Replacement with the SAPIEN 3 Transcatheter Heart Valve.  ;"Differences in the benefits of conscious sedation (CS) and general anesthesia (GA) during transfemoral aortic valve implantation (TAVI) are unclear.We aimed to assess differences in procedural and clinical outcomes based on the type of anesthesia received during TAVI.We analyzed SOURCE 3 Registry data for patients who received the SAPIEN 3 valve by type of anesthesia used during TAVI.Of the 1694 TAVI patients, 1027 received CS and 667 received GA. Patients were similar at baseline (81.5 years; Society of Thoracic Surgeons risk score 7.0). Compared with the GA group, the CS group had fewer intra-procedural transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and post implantation dilatations performed, and less contrast medium was used. The CS group had significantly less kidney injury at 7 days post-procedure than the GA group (0.4% versus 1.5%, P = 0.014). Moderate paravalvular leaks (PVL) occurred more frequently in the CS group versus the GA group (2.2% versus 0.8%; P = 0.041). No severe PVL were reported. Median total hospital length of stay (LOS) after TAVI was 10 days in the CS group and 11 days in the GS group. At 30 days, all-cause death was 2.1% in CS and 1.7% in GS (P = 0.47), and myocardial infarction was 0.2% in CS and 0.1% in GS (P = 0.83).Our analyses found no significant major outcome differences between CS and GA during TAVI.

Late Migration of a Paravalvular Leak Closure Device.  ;Paravalvular leak (PVL) is a serious complication of surgical valve replacement, often affecting elderly, multimorbid, high-risk patients. The risk of surgical intervention is often prohibitive in these cases, and so percutaneous PVL closure emerged as a feasible and effective management strategy, with a low complication rate. Specific devices for closure of PVL's are currently not widely available, and so PVLs are closed using generic vascular closure devices, which may result in residual paravalvular regurgitation or even closure device displacement. Although rare, late displacement of the closure device with prosthetic impingement can be life threatening, requiring urgent intervention.We present a case of a seventy-year-old gentleman with rheumatic heart disease and multiple previous mechanical aortic and mitral valve replacements. After repeated admissions for decompensated heart failure, secondary to paravalvular mitral regurgitation, a percutaneous paravalvular leak closure was performed with successful reduction of the leak. He represented 30 days later with cardiogenic shock and multiorgan failure secondary to torrential central mitral regurgitation caused by late displacement of the closure device with mitral prosthesis impingement. Due to an excessively high surgical risk, his case was successfully managed percutaneously with retrieval of the displaced device and closure of the PVL using two Amplatzer Vascular Plug III devices. At the six-month review, he remains asymptomatic.Percutaneous PVL closure is an effective strategy for patients with prohibitive surgical risk. Late closure device displacement can be a life-threatening complication. Our case demonstrates that percutaneous management of this complication is feasible even in patients presenting in extremis.  
Likelihood of Aortic Valve Preservation During Repair of Acute Type A Aortic Dissection.  ;BACKGROUND: We sought risk factors for replacement of the aortic valve with or without the root (AVR/root) in the setting of acute type A aortic dissection (ATAD) repair. METHODS: All ATAD repairs at our institution from January 2005 to June 2018 were reviewed. Baseline characteristics were recorded. For patients with aortic valve preservation we documented the degree of aortic insufficiency (AI) postoperatively and on subsequent echocardiograms when available. Logistic regression was used to determine the association between preoperative characteristics and the odds ratio of AVR/root. RESULTS: A total of 206 patients underwent repair of ATAD. Thirty-four were excluded for no documented AI grading. Forty-six underwent AVR/root during repair of the ATAD (including 40 root replacements). Of 126 that did not undergo AVR/root, 42 (33.33%) had follow-up echocardiograms at a median of 68 months postoperatively and 2 required reintervention for valve insufficiency. Increase in degree of AI, bicuspid valve morphology, size of the aortic root, and connective tissue disorder were significantly associated with increased risk of AVR/root. Of 130 patients without connective tissue disorder, bicuspid aortic valve, aortic root aneurysm, or intimal root tear, the rate of valve preservation was 65/65 (100%), 25/29 (86.2%), and 22/40 (55%) for those presenting with mild, moderate, and severe AI, respectively. DISCUSSION: Degree of preoperative AI, bicuspid valve morphology, size of the aortic root, and connective tissue disorder significantly correlate with failure of aortic valve preservation in patients with ATAD. The vast majority of tricuspid valves in patients without connective tissue disorder or aortic root pathology can be salvaged.  
Successful venoplasty of superior vena cava stenosis in a patient with a total artificial heart after orthotopic heart transplantation due to primary graft failure.  ;BACKGROUND: With the limited number of available suitable donor hearts resulting in plateaued numbers of heart transplantations, short- and long-term mechanical circulatory support devices, including the implantation of total artificial hearts (TAHs) are modalities that are increasingly being used as treatment options for patients with end-stage heart failure. The superior vena cava syndrome has been described in this context in various disease processes. We report successful venoplasty for superior vena cava syndrome in a patient with a TAH. CASE PRESENTATION: A 65-year-old man with a history of nonischemic cardiomyopathy had received a left ventricular assist device, and then 2 years later, underwent orthotopic heart transplantation using the bicaval anastomosis technique. The postprocedural course was complicated by primary graft failure, resulting in the need for implantation of a TAH. About 5 months after TAH implantation, he started to develop complications such as volume retention, swelling of the upper extremities, and was diagnosed to have a superior vena cava syndrome. The patient underwent a successful venoplasty of his superior vena cava by interventional radiology with resolution of upper body edema, normalization of renal, and liver function. CONCLUSION: Potential fatal complications caused by catheter or wire entrapment in the right-sided mechanical valve of a TAH have been reported. We describe a safe method for the treatment of superior vena cava syndrome in patients with TAH.  
Inorganic-polymerization crosslinked tissue-siloxane hybrid as potential biomaterial for bioprosthetic heart valves.  ;Bioprosthetic heart valve (BHV) replacement is increasingly used for treating valve-related diseases worldwide but the current commercially used BHVs treated with glutaraldehyde (Glut) often failed within 12-15 years due to degradation, thrombosis, inferior biocompatibility, and calcification. Herein, 3-glycidyloxypropyl trimethoxysilane (GPTMS) was used to crosslink porcine pericardium (PP) at the concentration (vol/vol) of 0.25%, 1%, 2%, and 4% and their performance for potential application in BHVs was evaluated. The crosslinking mechanism mainly involved the ring-opening of epoxide by amine attack and silanol poly-condensation. The stability of collagen in higher concentration (1%, 2%, and 4%) GPTMS crosslinked PPs (GPTMS-PPs) was clearly increased. GPTMS-PPs showed no cytotoxicity and supported the growth of endothelial cells while Glut-PP did not. GPTMS-PPs were less prothrombotic than Glut-PP. GPTMS-PP crosslinked at 1% concentration showed comparable mechanical properties to Glut-PP while had better anti-tearing performance. The subcutaneous implantation in rat for 30 days showed that GPTMS crosslinking was able to effectively inhibit the calcification of BHV.  
Safety-net hospitals versus non-safety centers and clinical outcomes after trans-catheter aortic valve replacement.  ;"OBJECTIVE: To compare post-procedural outcomes of trans-catheter valve replacement (TAVR) among safety-net (SNH) and non-safety net hospitals (non-SNH). BACKGROUND: SNH treat a large population of un-insured and low income patients; prior studies report worse outcome at these centers. Results of TAVR at these centers is limited. METHODS: Adults undergoing TAVR at hospitals in the US participating in the National In-patient sample (NIS) database from January 2014 to December 2015 were included. A 1:1 propensity-matched cohort of patients operated at SNH and non-SNH institutions was analyzed, on the basis of 16 demographic and clinical co-variates. Main outcome was all-cause post-procedural mortality. Secondary outcomes included stroke, acute kidney injury and length of post-operative stay. RESULTS: Between 2014 and 2015, 41,410 patients (mean age 80 ± 0.11 years, 46% female) underwent TAVR at 731 centers; 6,996 (16.80%) procedures were performed at SNH comprising 135/731 (18.4%) of all centers performing TAVR. SNH patients were more likely to be female (49% vs. 46%, p < .001); admitted emergently (31% vs. 21%; p < .001; at the lowest quartile for household income (25% % vs. 20%; p < .001) and from minorities (Blacks 5.9% vs. 3.9%; Hispanic 7.2% vs. 3.2%).Adjusted logistic regression was performed on 6,995 propensity-matched patient pairs. Post-procedural mortality [OR 0.99(0.98-1.007); p = .43], stroke [OR 1.009(0.99-1.02); p = .08], acute kidney injury [OR 0.99(0.96-1.01); p = .5] and overall length of stay (6.9 ± 0.1 vs. 7.1 ± 0.2 days; p = .57) were comparable in both cohorts. CONCLUSION: Post-procedural outcomes after TAVR at SNH are comparable to national outcomes and wider adoption of TAVR at SNH may not adversely influence outcomes.  "

Evaluation of the Efficacy of Crataegus oxyacantha in Dogs with Early-Stage Heart Failure.  ;"BACKGROUND:  Myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) is the most common cardiopathy in middle-aged dogs. When the dog is asymptomatic and has an enlarged left atrium, treatment is beneficial; however, some allopathic drugs are very costly and may produce side effects. To extend the duration of this asymptomatic phase, complementary therapies such as herbal medicine and homeopathy are available. Although herbal therapy with extract of Crataegus oxyacantha is beneficial, there is a risk of adverse reactions-unlike with homeopathy, where the risk is minimized with the administration of ultra-diluted doses. OBJECTIVE:  This study evaluated the efficacy of Crataegus oxyacantha, as mother tincture (MT) and in 6 cH homeopathic formulation, in treating the initial phase of heart failure due to MMVD in a veterinary clinic setting. METHODS:  A total of 30 dogs with MMVD, 7 years or older and weighing up to 10 kg, were randomized into three groups as follows: Crataegus 6 cH, Crataegus MT, and hydroalcoholic solution (placebo). Animals were evaluated through echocardiography parameters, laboratory blood tests, and systolic blood pressure (SBP) measurements at 30, 60, 90, and 120 days after initiation of therapy, for statistical analysis and monitoring of the blinded study. RESULTS:  Patients who received Crataegus 6 cH showed a reduction in SBP 60 days after treatment, while those receiving Crataegus MT exhibited a reduction 90 days after the therapy was initiated. There was a significant linear regression when evaluating the effect of treatment with Crataegus 6 cH on SBP measurements over the evaluation intervals (linear equation: SBP = 176.57 mm Hg - 0.21x, where x represents days of treatment). There was an increase in both fractional shortening and isovolumetric relaxation time for those patients receiving the homeopathic formulation. CONCLUSIONS:  Therapy with Crataegus was beneficial for hypertensive and cardiopathic dogs with MMVD, extending the duration of the asymptomatic phase. The reduction in SBP occurred more swiftly in the 6 cH group than in the MT-treated dogs.  "
Inhibition of PP2A enhances the osteogenic differentiation of human aortic valvular interstitial cells via ERK and p38 MAPK pathways.  ;AIMS: To investigate the role of PP2A in calcified aortic valve disease (CAVD). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The expressions of PP2A subunits were detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blot in aortic valves from patients with CAVD and normal controls, the activities of PP2A were analyzed by commercial assay kit at the same time. Aortic valve calcification of mice was evaluated through histological and echocardiographic analysis. ApoE-/- mice and ApoE-/- mice injected intraperitoneally with PP2A inhibitor LB100 were fed a high-cholesterol diet for 24 weeks. Immunofluorescent staining was used to locate the cell-type in which PP2A activity was decreased, the PP2A activity of valvular interstitial cells (VICs) treated with osteogenic induction medium was assessed by western blot and commercial assay kit. After changing the activity of VICs through pharmacologic and genetic intervention, the osteoblast differentiation and mineralization were assessed by western blot and Alizarin Red staining. Finally, the mechanism was clarified by using several specific inhibitors. KEY FINDINGS: PP2A activity was decreased both in calcified aortic valves and human VICs under osteogenic induction. The PP2A inhibitor LB100 aggravated the aortic valve calcification of mice. Furthermore, PPP2CA overexpression inhibited osteogenic differentiation of VICs, whereas PPP2CA knockdown promoted the process. Further study revealed that the ERK/p38 MAPKs signaling pathways mediated the osteogenic differentiation of VICs induced by PP2A inactivation. SIGNIFICANCE: This study demonstrated that PP2A plays an important role in CAVD pathophysiology, PP2A activation may provide a novel strategy for the pharmacological treatment of CAVD.  
Immediate outcome following valve surgery for rheumatic heart disease: the first local experience from Ethiopia.  ;BACKGROUND: Rheumatic heart disease is the most common cardiac diseases in developing countries including Ethiopia. The current study aimed to describe the immediate surgical outcome following valve surgery for rheumatic heart disease in Ethiopia. METHODS: Data were collected through chart abstraction from two centres in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia: the Cardiac Center of Ethiopia and El Ouzier cardiac centre. Included were all patients who were operated for rheumatic valvular heart disease in the mentioned centres by local cardiac surgical team during the period from June 2017 to April 2020. Demographic and clinical characteristics of the study population at admission and within 30 days of the index cardiac surgery were collected. Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 20.0 for windows was used to analyse the data. RESULT: Of the 114 patients included in the study (median age 31 years with interquartile range of 23-40), 62 (54.4%) of them were female. Surgical procedures done were triple valve surgery 9 (7.9%) patients, mitral and tricuspid valves 26 (22.8%) patients, double-valve 16 (14.0%) patients, single-valve surgery 50.9% (11 aortic and 47 mitral valves) of patients, redo mitral valve surgery 3 (2.6%) patients, and left maze with mitral valve surgery 2 (1.8%) patients. Of the total, 103 (90.4%) of them had mitral valve surgery. Post-operatively, 5 (4.4%) patients died within 30 days following the index surgery. CONCLUSION: Immediate surgical outcome following valve surgery for rheumatic heart disease had excellent outcome in our setting. This evidence can be taken as a show of success in building local capacity to manage rheumatic heart disease surgically.  
Novel oral anticoagulant vs. warfarin in elderly atrial fibrillation patients with normal, mid-range, and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction.  ;AIMS: Patients with concomitant atrial fibrillation (AF) and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) have poor prognosis. Outcomes of novel oral anticoagulant (NOAC) in elderly AF patients with normal, mid-range, and reduced LVEF were investigated. METHODS AND RESULTS: Data were retrieved from Chang Gung Research Database during 2010-2017 for patients with AF. We excluded patients with venous thromboembolism within 6 months, total knee/hip replacement and heart valve replacement within 6 months, end-stage renal disease, stroke/systemic embolism (SE)/death within 7 days, age <65 years old, or no records of LVEF. Primary outcomes were ischaemic stroke (IS)/SE, major bleeding, and death from any cause. There was a total of 50 035 elderly AF patients retrieved. After exclusion criteria, 9615 patients with normal LVEF ≥ 50%, 737 with mid-range LVEF 41-49%, and 908 with reduced LVEF ≤ 40% were studied. At end of follow-up, patients on NOAC had significantly reduced IS/SE compared with warfarin in LVEF ≥ 50% [adjusted hazard ration (aHR) 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.71-0.89] and LVEF 41-49% (aHR 0.57, 95% CI 0.36-0.88) after adjusting for covariates, while there was no difference in LVEF ≤ 40%. Patients on NOAC had significantly reduced major bleeding in all LVEF groups. In addition, patients on NOAC had significantly reduced death compared with warfarin in LVEF ≥ 50% (aHR 0.81, 95% CI 0.67-0.98). CONCLUSIONS: In elderly AF patients ≥65 years, using NOAC was associated with lower IS/SE compared with warfarin in normal and mid-range LVEF but not in reduced LVEF. Using NOACs was associated with lower death compared with warfarin in normal LVEF.  
Trilayered tissue construct mimicking the orientations of three layers of a native heart valve leaflet.  ;"A tissue-engineered heart valve can be an alternative to a prosthetic valve in heart valve replacement; however, it is not fully efficient in terms of long-lasting functionality, as leaflets in engineered valves do not possess the trilayered native leaflet structure. Previously, we developed a flat, trilayered, oriented nanofibrous (TN) scaffold mimicking the trilayered structure and orientation of native heart valve leaflets. In vivo tissue engineering-a practical regenerative medicine technology-can be used to develop an autologous heart valve. Thus, in this study, we used our flat, trilayered, oriented nanofibrous scaffolds to develop trilayered tissue structures with native leaflet orientations through in vivo tissue engineering in a rat model. After 2 months of in vivo tissue engineering, infiltrated cells and their deposited collagen fibrils were found aligned in the circumferential and radial layers, and randomly oriented in the random layer of the scaffolds, i.e., trilayered tissue constructs (TTCs) were developed. Tensile properties of the TTCs were higher than that of the control tissue constructs (without any scaffolds) due to influence of fibers of the scaffolds in tissue engineering. Different extracellular matrix proteins-collagen, glycosaminoglycans, and elastin-that exist in native leaflets were observed in the TTCs. Gene expression of the TTCs indicated that the tissue constructs were in growing stage. There was no sign of calcification in the tissue constructs. The TTCs developed with the flat TN scaffolds indicate that an autologous leaflet-shaped, trilayered tissue construct that can function as a native leaflet can be developed.  "
Cardiac magnetic resonance systematically overestimates mitral regurgitations by the indirect method.  ;OBJECTIVE: Cardiac MRI is quickly emerging as the gold standard for assessment of mitral regurgitation, most commonly with the indirect method subtracting forward flow in aorta from volumetric segmentation of the left ventricle. We aimed to investigate how aortic flow measurements with increasing distance from the aortic valve affect calculated mitral regurgitations and whether measurements were influenced by breath-hold regimen. METHODS: Free-breathing and breath-hold phase contrast flows were measured in aorta at valve level, sinotubular (ST) junction, mid-ascending aorta and in the pulmonary trunk. Flow measurements were pairwise compared, and subsequently, after exclusion of patients with visible mitral and tricuspid regurgitations for left-sided and right-sided comparisons, respectively, flow-measured stroke volumes were compared with ventricular volumetric segmentations. RESULTS: Thirty-nine participants without arrhythmias or structural abnormalities of the large vessels were included. Stroke volumes measured with free-breathing and breath-hold flow decreased equally with increasing distance to the aortic valves (breath-hold flow: aortic valve 105.6±20.8 mL, ST junction 101.5±20.7 mL, mid-ascending aorta 98.1±21.5 mL). After exclusion of atrioventricular regurgitations, stroke volumes determined by volumetric measurements were higher compared with values determined by flow measurements, corresponding to 'false' atrioventricular regurgitations of 8.0%±5.8% with flow measured at valve level, 11.6%±5.2% at the ST junction and 15.3%±5.0% at the mid-ascending aorta. CONCLUSIONS: Stroke volumes determined by flow decrease throughout the proximal aorta and are systematically lower than volumetrically measured stroke volumes. The indirect method systematically overestimates mitral regurgitations, especially with increasing distance from the aortic valves.

Multimodality Imaging in the Diagnostic Work-Up of Endocarditis and Cardiac Implantable Electronic Device (CIED) Infection.  ;Infective endocarditis (IE) is a serious cardiac condition, which includes a wide range of clinical presentations, with varying degrees of severity. The diagnosis is multifactorial and a proper characterization of disease requires the identification of the primary site of infection (usually the cardiac valve) and the search of secondary systemic complications. Early depiction of local complications or distant embolization has a great impact on patient management and prognosis, as it may induce to aggressive antibiotic treatment or, in more advanced cases, cardiac surgery. In this setting, the multimodality imaging has assumed a pivotal role in the clinical decision making and it requires the physician to be aware of the advantages and disadvantages of each imaging technique. Echocardiography is the first imaging test, but it has several limitations. Therefore, the integration with other imaging modalities (computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, nuclear imaging) becomes often necessary. Different strategies should be applied depending on whether the infection is suspected or already ascertained, whether located in native or prosthetic valves, in the left or right chambers, or if it involves an implanted cardiac device. In addition, detection of extracardiac IE-related lesions is crucial for a correct management and treatment. The aim of this review is to illustrate strengths and weaknesses of the various methods in the most common clinical scenarios.  
Accelerated treatment of endocarditis-The POET II trial: Rationale and design of a randomized controlled trial.  ;BACKGROUND: The optimal antibiotic treatment length for infective endocarditis (IE) is uncertain. International guidelines recommend treatment duration of up to 6 weeks for patients with left-sided IE but are primarily based on historical data and expert opinion. Efficacies of modern therapies, fast recovery seen in many patients with IE, and complications to long hospital stays challenge the rationale for fixed treatment durations in all patients. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to conduct a noninferiority randomized controlled trial (acronym POET II) investigating the safety of accelerated (shortened) antibiotic therapy as compared to standard duration in patients with left-sided IE. METHODS: The POET II trial is a multicenter, multinational, open-label, noninferiority randomized controlled trial. Patients with definite left-sided IE due to Streptococcus spp, Staphylococcus aureus, or Enterococcus faecalis will be eligible for enrolment. Each patient will be randomized to accelerated antibiotic treatment or standard-length treatment (1:1) following clinical stabilization as defined by clinical parameters, laboratory values, and transesophageal echocardiography findings. Accelerated treatment will be between 2 and 4 weeks, whereas standard-length treatment will be between 4 and 6 weeks, depending on microbiologic etiology, complications, need for valve surgery, and prosthetic versus native valve endocarditis. The primary outcome is a composite of all-cause mortality, unplanned cardiac surgery, relapse of bacteremia, or embolization within 6 months of randomization. CONCLUSIONS: The POET II trial will investigate the safety of accelerated antibiotic therapy for patients with left-sided IE caused by Streptococcus spp, Staphylococcus aureus, or Enterococcus faecalis. The results of the POET II trial will improve the evidence base of treatment recommendations, and clinical practice may be altered.  
Cardiac filling and ejection time fractions by pulsed Doppler: fetal nomograms and potential clinical application.  ;OBJECTIVES: Fetal cardiac function can be evaluated using a variety of parameters. Among these, cardiac cycle time-related parameters such as filling (FTF) and ejection time fractions (ETF) are promising but scarcely studied. We aimed to report the feasibility and reproducibility of FTF and ETF measurements by spectral Doppler, to provide reference ranges in fetal life, after evaluating their relationship with heart rate (HR), gestational age (GA) and estimated fetal weight (EFW) and to evaluate their potential clinical utility in selected fetal conditions. METHODS: This study included a low-risk prospective cohort of 602 singleton pregnancies and a high-risk population of 54 fetuses (9 pairs of monochorionic twins with severe twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS), 16 aortic stenosis (AoS) and 20 aortic coarctation (CoA)) from 18-41 weeks. Left (LV) and right ventricular (RV) inflow and outflow spectral Doppler signals were analysed. Valve clicks were used as landmarks. FTF was calculated as: (Filling time/Cycle time)*100 and ETF as (Ejection time/Cycle time)*100. Interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to evaluate intra and inter-observer reproducibility. The relations between FTF, ETF, HR, GA and EFW were evaluated using multivariate regression analysis. Nomograms for these parameters were then constructed using the low risk population. Z-scores of FTF and ETF of the high-risk fetuses were calculated and analysed. RESULTS: Adequate Doppler traces for FTF and ETF could be obtained in 95% of cases. Intra-observer reproducibility was excellent (ICC>0.900) and inter-observer reproducibility was good (ICC>0.800) for all timing parameters analysed. Multivariate analysis of FTF and ETF in relation to HR, GA and EFW identified HR as the only variable predicting FTF. In contrast, ETF was dependent on both HR and GA. While FTF increased with HR reduction, ETF showed the opposite behaviour, decreasing with HR (more markedly at lower GA) in low-risk fetuses. Most recipient twins with severe TTTS showed reduced FTF and preserved ETF. AoS was associated with decreased FTF and increased ETF in the LV with seemingly different patterns associated with a univentricular versus biventricular postnatal outcome. The majority of fetuses with CoA had FTF and ETF within the normal range in both ventricles. CONCLUSIONS: Measurement of FTF and ETF are feasible and reproducible in the fetus. Nomograms account for associations of FTF with HR and ETF with HR and GA. These time fractions are potentially useful for clinical monitoring of cardiac function in TTTS, aortic stenosis and other fetal conditions overloading the heart.

Effect of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement on Retinal Layer Thickness Measured by Optical Coherence Tomography.  ;Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is associated with clinically significant cerebral microembolism and cognitive status changes. There are no data on the impact of TAVR on retinal layers. We assessed the influence of TAVR on the retinal nerve fiber layer, ganglion cell complex (GCC), and macular thickness (MT) measured by spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). Elderly patients (n = 50) with severe aortic stenosis undergoing TAVR were included in this study (mean age: 78.5 ± 6.9 years). Retinal nerve fiber layer, GCC, and MT were measured with SD-OCT by an ophthalmologist before and on the first day and in the first month after TAVR. The average MT was significantly increased on the first day after TAVR compared with the basal value (P = .04). Ganglion cell complex thickness was significantly thinner on the first day after TAVR than the basal value in the inner inferior quadrant and outer temporal quadrant of the left eye (P = .03 and .04, respectively). Postoperative changes observed on the first day compared with the preoperative period returned to basal values in the first month. In conclusion, TAVR did not cause permanent changes in retinal layers.  
Autophagy, Myocarditis, and Cardiomyopathy.  ;Direct damage and immune responses after viral infection lead to myocarditis. Autophagy is involved in both viral clearance and replication. In this chapter, we will briefly describe the role of autophagy in viral myocarditis. In addition, we will discuss the role of autophagy in dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and diabetic cardiomyopathy.  
Predictors of conduction recovery after permanent pacemaker implantation following transcatheter aortic valve replacement.  ;PURPOSE: Conduction disturbances after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) requiring pacemaker (PPM) implantation are a known complication and may be reversible. Therefore, we sought to evaluate the incidence and predictors for atrioventricular (AV) conduction recovery after TAVR. METHODS: A single-center, retrospective study of patients undergoing PPM implantation for conduction disorders after TAVR between June 2011 and March 2019. Conduction recovery was defined as ≤ 1% ventricular pacing (VP) on follow-up PPM interrogation. RESULTS: A total of 110 patients (mean age 83.6 ± 6.6 years, 46.8% female) were included. At a median follow-up of 438 days (interquartile range [IQR] 111-760 days), 35 patients (32%) had conduction recovery, with 50% of these occurring within the first 6 months. On multivariate analysis, predictors of conduction recovery include female sex (hazard ratio [HR] 2.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-6.4, p = 0.048), non-VP/non-complete heart block rhythm immediately post-TAVR (HR 5.2, 95% CI 1.5-18.1, p = 0.011), normal sinus rhythm 7 days post-TAVR (HR 3.9, 95% CI 1.7-9.2, p = 0.002), and smaller valve size (mm) (HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.7-0.996, p = 0.045). Significant narrowing of the QRS and resolution of new-onset left bundle branch block within 1 month post-TAVR occurred in those with conduction recovery on PPM interrogation. CONCLUSIONS: One-third of patients receiving new PPM implantation have conduction recovery after TAVR, with 50% occurring within the first 6 months. Patient gender, valve size, and rhythm on serial ECGs after TAVR can help identify patients that may recover AV conduction. A conservative approach rather than immediate PPM implantation may be considered in these patients.  
Brucella prosthetic valve endocarditis with septic and cardiogenic shock.  ;A young man with aortic prosthetic valve replacement, presented with prolonged fever and diagnosed with brucella endocarditis based on positive transthoracic echo findings with high titer positive brucellacapt serology. He was started on medical treatment with doxycycline and rifampin to which gentamicin and ceftriaxone were added and he was planned for surgical intervention. Unfortunately, the patient developed cardiogenic with septic shock before performing surgery and died within 24 h soon after admission.  
Coxiella Endocarditis as the Cause of Recurrent Fever and Brain Abscess in a Patient with Complex Congenital Heart Disease: A Case Report and Literature Review.  ;INTRODUCTION: Blood culture-negative infective endocarditis (BCNIE) can present subtly and is associated with a diagnostic delay leading to increased morbidity and mortality. Case Report. We present the case of an 18-year-old male with a history of complex congenital heart disease and 3-year intermittent episodes of fever of unknown origin, who was referred to our hospital for upper and lower extremity focal seizures. Laboratory blood tests were normal, blood cultures were negative, and brain imaging revealed an abscess. Cardiology consultation was requested, and transthoracic echocardiography revealed an intracardiac vegetation. Empiric antibiotic treatment with sultamicillin, gentamycin, and meropenem was initiated. Serology testing was positive for Coxiella burnetii, and the diagnosis of BCNIE was established. The antibiotic course was changed to oral doxycycline for 36 months and led to resolution of IE, with no vegetation detected on TTE after 15 months. CONCLUSION: BCNIE is a life-threatening disease entity that can lead to severe complications, such as valve regurgitation, emboli, and death. Patients with congenital heart disease are particularly vulnerable to IE. Timely diagnosis and antibiotic management are of paramount importance in order to avoid the potentially fatal sequelae.  
Cardiac Magnetic Resonance in Valvular Heart Disease: Assessment of Severity and Myocardial Remodeling.  ;Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) has emerged as the gold standard in assessing ventricular mass, volume, and systolic function. Due to these and other strengths, CMR has increasingly been used to study valvular heart disease (VHD) and resultant cardiac remodeling. By using CMR to assess flow, limitations in echocardiographic assessment of VHD can be overcome, particularly in regurgitant lesions. The following article reviews the current role of CMR imaging in studying disease severity and myocardial remodeling in patients with VHD.  
Cardiac Computed Tomography for Structural Heart Disease Assessment and Therapeutic Planning: Focus on Prosthetic Valve Dysfunction.  ;Of the 100,000-plus valve surgeries performed each year in the United States, up to 6% of those develop complications from prosthetic valve dysfunction. Prosthetic valve dysfunction (PVD) can be life threatening and often challenging to diagnose. In this review, we discuss the prevalence and incidence of PVD, explore its different etiologies, and assess the role of multimodality imaging with an emphasis on cardiac multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) for evaluating patients with PVD. We also investigate the utility of MDCT in preprocedural planning for transcatheter devices and redo surgical planning and discuss management strategies for patients with PVD.  
Cardiovascular outcomes of pregnancy in Turner syndrome.  ;OBJECTIVES: Women with Turner syndrome (TS) are frequently counselled against pregnancy due to lack of data and unclear aortic dissection risk. However, with advances in fertility therapy, more women with TS are contemplating pregnancy. This study compared rates of adverse cardiovascular (CV) outcomes among: (1) pregnant and non-pregnant women with TS and (2) pregnant women with TS with/without structural heart disease. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of pregnant and age-matched non-pregnant controls with TS (2005-2017) across 10 CV centres was done. Data were collected at initial evaluation in pregnancy and outcomes were assessed to 6 months postpartum. Adverse CV events were defined as CV death, aortic dissection/rupture and/or aortic intervention. Non-pregnant age-matched controls were followed over the same time period. RESULTS: Sixty-eight pregnancies were included (60 women, mean age 33 years, 48% primigravid, 49% fertility therapy, 80% structurally normal heart, 25% XO karyotype). Based on American Society of Reproductive Medicine criteria, 10 pregnancies occurred in women stratified to high-risk category. There were no CV events in the pregnant women or in the non-pregnant women with TS. Obstetric events complicated 12 (18%) pregnancies with 9 (13%) attributed to hypertensive disorder of pregnancy. Fetal events included small for gestational age neonates (18%), preterm delivery (15%) and fetal death (3%). CONCLUSIONS: This study helps to refine the approach to pregnancy in women with TS. Among women with TS without structural heart disease, pregnancy does not impose an increased risk of CV outcomes. Among women with TS with structural heart disease, the risk of pregnancy is not as prohibitive as previously described but does require ongoing evaluation.  
Simultaneous quantitative assessment of two distinct cell lineages with a nuclear-localized dual genetic reporter.  ;Genetic lineage tracing has been widely used for studying in vivo cell fate plasticity during embryogenesis, tissue homeostasis, and disease development. Recent applications with multiple site-specific recombinases have been used in complex and sophisticated genetic fate mapping studies. However, the previous multicolor reporters for dual recombinases had limitations of precise in situ quantification of cell number, which is mainly due to the intermingling of cells in condensed tissues. Here, we generated a dual recombinase-mediated nuclear-localized GFP and tdTomato reporter line, which enables clear, simultaneous quantification of two distinct cell lineages in vivo. Combining this dual genetic reporter with Tbx18-Cre and Cdh5-Dre lines, which genetically trace epicardial and endothelial cells, respectively, we obtained high-resolution images for the anatomic distribution of the descendants of these two distinct cell lineages in the valve mesenchyme during development, remodeling, and maturation stages. This new dual genetic reporter is expected to facilitate fate tracing of two cell lineages and their objective quantification in vivo.  
Mitral valve repair with minimally invasive approaches vs sternotomy: A meta-analysis of early and late results in randomized and matched observational studies.  ;"BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE STUDY: Minimally invasive cardiac surgery (MICS) for mitral valve repair (MVRp) has been increasingly used. This study aimed to evaluate the early and late results of MICS for MVRp vs conventional sternotomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials or observational studies (with matched populations) comparing MICS and conventional MVRp reporting any of the following outcomes: mortality, MVRp failure, complications, blood transfusion, readmission within 30 days after discharge, long-term reoperation for mitral regurgitation, operative times, mechanical ventilation time, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, or hospital stay. The pooled treatment effects were calculated using a random-effects model. RESULTS: Ten studies involving 6792 patients (MICS: 3396 patients; Conventional: 3296 patients) met the eligibility criteria. In the pooled analysis, MICS significantly reduced the risk for blood transfusion (odds ratio [OR], 0.654; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.462-0.928; P = .017) and readmission within 30 days after discharge (OR, 0.615; 95% 0.456-0.829; P = .001). MICS was associated with a significantly longer cross-clamp time (mean difference 14 minutes; 95% CI, 7.4-21 minutes; P < .001), CPB time (24 minutes; 95% CI, 14-35 minutes; P < .001), and total operative time (36; 95% CI, 15-56 minutes; P < .001), but a significantly shorter ICU stay (-8.5; 95% CI -15; -1.8; P = .013) and hospital stay (-1.3, 95% CI -2.1; -0.45; P = .003). This meta-analysis found no significant difference regarding the risk of in-hospital and long-term mortality, nor complications. CONCLUSIONS: Despite longer operative times, MICS for MVRp reduces ICU and hospital stay, as well as readmission rates and the need for transfusion.  "
Surgical explantation of a partially detached cardioband device.  ;"Transcatheter repair systems are becoming increasingly popular as a potential solution for high-risk and inoperable patients with mitral regurgitation. The cardioband (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, California) is a transcatheter direct annuloplasty device, based on the concept of an undersized ring annuloplasty. We report a case of minimally invasive surgical explantation of a failed cardioband device 21 months after its implantation. Intraoperatively, it was found that three anchors of the cardioband device were detached from the posterior annulus at P2. In this report, a ""cut and unscrew"" technique with some tips and tricks is presented for the removal of the device.  "

Prediction of temporary epicardial pacing wire use in cardiac surgery.  ;BACKGROUND: Placement of temporary epicardial pacing wires (TEPW) at the end of open heart surgery cases is routine but can be associated with complications. Identification of patients who are high risk for requiring pacing would be beneficial on guiding selective TEPW placement. The purpose of this study was to identify predictors of temporary pacing immediately post cardiac surgery. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of patients undergoing cardiac surgery from 2005 to 2016 at the Maritime Heart Center was conducted. Analysis was performed of patients who require pacing on arrival to the cardiovascular intensive care unit (CVICU) compared with those who were not paced. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine each variable's risk adjusted likelihood of pacing for the entire cohort. Subgroup analysis was performed in the isolated procedures. RESULTS: A total of 11 752 patient underwent surgery from the year 2005 to 2016. Two thousand and fifty-one (17.5%) required pacing on arrival to CVICU. Older age, female sex, preoperative renal failure, lower ejection fraction (EF), preoperative arrhythmia, preoperative use of calcium channel blockers, and longer cross-clamp times were risk factors for pacing. In the isolated coronary artery bypass grafting and aortic valve replacement groups, findings were similar to the overall cohort. Only age, obesity, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were risk factors for pacing in the isolated mitral valve (MV) repair group and only preoperative arrhythmia in the isolated MV replacement group. CONCLUSION: We have identified risk factors for TEPW use following cardiac surgery and in isolated procedure subgroups. These risk factors may help guide selective TEPW placement.  
Coronary revascularization during treatment of severe aortic stenosis: A meta-analysis of the complete percutaneous approach (PCI plus TAVR) versus the complete surgical approach (CABG plus SAVR).  ;"BACKGROUND: The management of patients with coexisting severe aortic stenosis (AS) and coronary artery disease (CAD) is still facing a great deal of uncertainty when it comes to choosing between the entire surgical versus the complete percutaneous approaches, after accurately balancing risks versus outcomes. AIM: To evaluate clinical outcomes and mortality of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) plus percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) compared with surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) plus coronary arteries bypass grafting (CABG) procedures in patients with concomitant AS and CAD. METHODS: Electronic databases of PubMed, EMBASE, and SCOPUS were searched for relevant articles assessing outcome parameters of interest. The study endpoints were the rate of overall myocardial infarction and stroke within 30 days and the rate of 30-day mortality and 2-year mortality between patients with TAVR/PCI and those with SAVR/CABG. RESULTS: Random-effect meta-analysis did not reveal any significant difference between 30-day safety outcomes: myocardial infarction (TAVR/PCI vs SAVR/CABG: odds ratio [OR]: 0.52; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.20-1.33; I2  = 0%), stroke (TAVR/PCI vs SAVR/CABG: OR: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.45-1.73; I2  = 0%). No significant difference in 30-day mortality (OR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.43-1.21; I2 = 0%) and 2-year mortality (OR: 1.50; 95% CI: 0.77-2.94; I2  = 81%) rate was noted between patients with TAVR/PCI and those with SAVR/CABG. CONCLUSIONS: When comparing the total percutaneous and total surgical treatment, no significant difference in short-term safety outcomes or early and late mortality was observed. More evidence is needed to guide the clinical decision.  "
Silent brain infarction after minimally invasive cardiac surgery with retrograde perfusion.  ;"BACKGROUND AND AIM: There is no report on silent brain infarction (SBI) after minimally invasive cardiac surgery (MICS) with retrograde perfusion. Thus, the current study aimed to investigate the incidence of SBI after MICS using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). METHODS: This study included 174 patients who underwent MICS with retrograde perfusion between July 2014 and July 2018. Preoperative computed tomography (CT) angiography was routinely performed and vascular pathology was evaluated for patient selection. Postoperative MRI was performed to investigate the occurrence of SBI. RESULTS: Out of the total 174 patients, 26 (14.9%) presented with SBI. A total of 61 SBI lesions were found in the 26 patients; of these, 34 (56%) SBI lesions were in the right hemisphere and 27 (44%) in the left hemisphere. SBIs were primarily observed in the posterior cerebral artery territory. Multivariate analysis revealed aortic stenosis to be the only risk factor of SBI. CONCLUSIONS: Retrograde perfusion via femoral cannulation may not increase the incidence of SBI in selected MICS patients based on preoperative CT findings.  "
Diffusion-weighted imaging in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: association with high T2-weighted signal intensity in addition to late gadolinium enhancement.  ;Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) has been confirmed to be associated with late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). In this context, we aimed to study whether DWI could reflect the active tissue injury and edema information of HCM which were usually indicated by T2 weighted images. Forty HCM patients were examined using a 3.0 T magnetic resonance scanner. Cine, T2-weighted short tau inversion recovery (T2-STIR), DWI and LGE sequences were acquired. T1 mapping was also included to quantify the focal and diffuse fibrosis. Cardiac troponin I (cTnI) was tested to assess the recently myocardial injury. Student's t-test, Mann-Whitney U test, One-way analysis, Kruskal-Wallis analysis, the Spearman correlation analysis, and multivariable regression were used in this study. The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) was significantly elevated in the cTnI positive group (P = 0.01) and correlated with LGE (ρ = 0.312, P = 0.049) and HighT2 extent (ρ = 0.443, P = 0.004) in the global level. In the segmental analysis, the ADC significantly differentiated the segments with and without HighT2/LGE presence (P = 0.00). The average ADC values were higher in segments with HighT2 and LGE coexistence than in those with only LGE presence (P < 0.05). Multivariable regression indicated that segmental HighT2 and LGE were both contributing factors to the ADC values. In this study of HCM, we confirmed that ADC as a molecular diffusion parameter reflects the replacement fibrosis of myocardium. Moreover, it also reveals edema extent and its association with serum cTnI.  
Wearable devices can predict the outcome of standardized 6-minute walk tests in heart disease.  ;"Wrist-worn devices with heart rate monitoring have become increasingly popular. Although current guidelines advise to consider clinical symptoms and exercise tolerance during decision-making in heart disease, it remains unknown to which extent wearables can help to determine such functional capacity measures. In clinical settings, the 6-minute walk test has become a standardized diagnostic and prognostic marker. We aimed to explore, whether 6-minute walk distances can be predicted by wrist-worn devices in patients with different stages of mitral and aortic valve disease. A total of n = 107 sensor datasets with 1,019,748 min of recordings were analysed. Based on heart rate recordings and literature information, activity levels were determined and compared to results from a 6-minute walk test. The percentage of time spent in moderate activity was a predictor for the achievement of gender, age and body mass index-specific 6-minute walk distances (p < 0.001; R 2 = 0.48). The uncertainty of these predictions is demonstrated.  "
Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation Readmissions in the Current Era (from the National Readmission Database).  ;Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has become the mainstream treatment for severe aortic stenosis. Despite improvement in device iteration and operator experience rigorous outcome data outside the scope of clinical trials is lacking. Nationwide readmission database 2016 and 2017 was utilized to identify the study population. International Classification of Disease,10th edition codes were used to identify TAVI admissions. Outcomes of interest were the 90-day readmission pattern and in hospital complications of the TAVI procedure. A total of 73,784 TAVI related index admissions were identified in the Nationwide Readmission Database in 2016 to 2017. Forty four percent of patients undergoing TAVI in that timeframe were discharged within 48 hours of their procedure. 16,343 patients (22.2%) were readmitted within 90 days after discharge. Major cardiac co-morbidities like heart failure were prevalent more often in the group of patients that were readmitted within 90 days. Noncardiac causes however accounted for two thirds of these readmissions. The median time to 90-day readmission was 31 days. Multivariate analysis showed that nonagenarians, patients undergoing transapical TAVI, and patients with a higher comorbidity burden were more likely to be readmitted within 90 days. In conclusion, almost half of TAVI patients in the US are discharged within 48 hours after their procedure and 20% of all TAVI patients are readmitted within 90 days. Most readmissions are due to noncardiac causes.  
Aortic Valve Stenosis and Mitochondrial Dysfunctions: Clinical and Molecular Perspectives.  ;Calcific aortic stenosis is a disorder that impacts the physiology of heart valves. Fibrocalcific events progress in conjunction with thickening of the valve leaflets. Over the years, these events promote stenosis and obstruction of blood flow. Known and common risk factors are congenital defects, aging and metabolic syndromes linked to high plasma levels of lipoproteins. Inflammation and oxidative stress are the main molecular mediators of the evolution of aortic stenosis in patients and these mediators regulate both the degradation and remodeling processes. Mitochondrial dysfunction and dysregulation of autophagy also contribute to the disease. A better understanding of these cellular impairments might help to develop new ways to treat patients since, at the moment, there is no effective medical treatment to diminish neither the advancement of valve stenosis nor the left ventricular function impairments, and the current approaches are surgical treatment or transcatheter aortic valve replacement with prosthesis.  
Malek R(1), Puckett Y(2).  ;Coarctation of the aorta is a type of congenital heart disease which is relatively common compared to the other congenital malformations with an approximate incidence of 3 cases out of 10,000 live births. This pathology is described as a narrowing or stenotic region in which blood traverses from ascending to descending aorta. Most commonly, it is present as a well defined stenotic region at the juxtaductal location. This defect is complex as it can present through the spectrum of age ranges, be associated with other congenital defects (patent ductus arteriosus, ventricular septal defect, bicuspid aortic valve, hypoplastic left heart syndrome), and carries a diffuse array of clinical case presentations. Coarctation of the aorta, first acknowledged by Morgagni in 1760, carries a poor clinical prognosis with a mean age of death at 34 years of age and a 75% mortality at a median age of 46, according to a well-documented autopsy study. Surgical intervention for coarctation of the aorta was first described in 1944. It was performed via open lateral thoracotomy by resecting the stenotic segment of the aorta with re-anastomosis of the resected ends. This intervention was found to have been associated with a high incidence of re-coarctation. This led to the next intervention, which was called patch aortoplasty technique. This technique involved an incision across the stenotic region with a prosthetic patch sutured across the incision area. This led to a reduction in re-coarctation but was met with a high incidence of aneurysmal formation in approximately 20 to 40% of cases. Another procedure was developed for the management of coarctation of the aorta. Subclavian flap aortoplasty involves incision of the left subclavian artery down to the aortic isthmus with anastomosis of this flap with the incision across the coarcted segment to increase the vessel lumen of the aortic segment. This procedure demonstrates a 23% recurrence rate with some incidence of aneurysmal formation and rarely is associated with a complication of left arm claudication with exercise. The current preferred method of surgical management of coarctation of the aorta in the majority of surgical centers in the world is the extended end to end anastomosis given its relatively low re-coarctation rate between 4% to 13%. This intervention involves clamping of the aortic arch proximally at the take-off of the subclavian artery and distal to the coarct segment. A surgical incision is made in the inferior part of the aortic arch, the coarcted portion is resected, and the end-to-end anastomosis is completed at the arch and descending aorta. An interposition graft technique is utilized in adult-sized patients and in those with a long coarcted segment of the aorta. The aorta is clamped proximally and distally to the coarcted segment, which is resected. In the place of the resected segment, a tube graft that is composed of a Dacron or aortic homograph is secured by creating two surgical anastomoses.  Transcatheter based intervention utilizing balloon angioplasty of the coarcted segment was first utilized in 1982. Compared to the surgical techniques, however, there was a significantly high re-coarctation rate in infants and less pronounced rate in adolescents and adults in the long term. Further development of technology, such as covered stents, has improved outcomes. This review will address the transcatheter management of coarctation of the aorta.  
Ex Vivo Analysis of a Porcine Bicuspid Aortic Valve and Aneurysm Disease Model.  ;We identified an extremely rare congenital porcine type 0 lateral bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) from a fresh porcine heart. Using a 3D-printed ex vivo left heart simulator, we analyzed valvular hemodynamics at baseline, in an aortic aneurysm disease model, and after valve-sparing root replacement (VSRR). We showed that BAV regurgitation due to aortic aneurysm can be successfully repaired without significant hemodynamic impairment with the VSRR technique in an individualized approach. Our results provide direct hemodynamic evidence supporting the use of VSRR for patients with BAV regurgitation.  
Transcatheter aortic valve replacement and percutaneous coronary intervention versus surgical aortic valve replacement and coronary artery bypass grafting in patients with severe aortic stenosis and concomitant coronary artery disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis.  ;"OBJECTIVES: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the early and midterm outcomes of patients who underwent surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) against patients who had transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). BACKGROUND: Contemporary guidelines suggest that surgical or percutaneous revascularization of significant coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) is a reasonable strategy. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive search of Medline and Embase to identify studies comparing a percutaneous transcatheter versus a surgical approach. Random effects meta-analyses using the Mantel-Haenszel method were performed to estimate the effect of percutaneous compared surgical strategies using aggregate data. RESULTS: Six studies reporting on 1770 participants were included in the meta-analysis. There were no significant differences in effect estimates for early and midterm mortality (OR: 0.78; 95% CI, 0.50-1.20 and OR: 1.09; 95% CI, 0.80-1.49, respectively) or myocardial infarction (OR: 0.52; 95% CI, 0.20-1.33 and OR: 1.34; 95% CI, 0.67-2.65, respectively). No significant difference was shown for peri-procedural stroke (OR: 0.80; 95% CI, 0.35-1.87). A transcatheter approach had a higher rate of major vascular complications (OR: 14.44; 95% CI, 4.42-47.16), but a lower rate of acute kidney injury (OR: 0.41; 95% CI, 0.19-0.91). CONCLUSION: Our analysis suggests that a percutaneous transcatheter approach confers similar outcomes compared to a surgical approach in patients with severe AS and CAD. However, our findings are based on low quality studies and should serve as hypothesis generating. In the absence of adequately powered studies yielding high level evidence, individualized decision making should be based on surgical risk assessment.  "
Ongoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) practice amidst a global COVID-19 crisis: nurse-led analgesia for transfemoral TAVI.  ;The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis has led to a relative unavailability of anaesthesiological support for non-acute cardiac care. Currently, transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TF-TAVI) is predominantly performed as an elective catheterisation laboratory (cath lab) procedure. Hence, the performance of TAVI could come to a halt amidst the COVID-19 crisis. Our study population comprised 90 patients treated with TF-TAVI, with local analgesia performed by our dedicated cath lab nurses. The patients had a mean age of 80 ± 5 years and 59% were male, with a predicted surgical risk of 2.2 ± 0.9/3.1 ± 2.4% (Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk of Mortality [STS-PROM] score/EuroSCORE II), depicting a contemporary, lower-risk population. The composite endpoint of device success (Valve Academic Research Consortium [VARC]-2) was reached in all patients. No patients showed more than mild paravalvular leakage (3/90, 3.3%). Overall, intravenous medication was sparsely used during the procedure, with 48 of the 90 (53%) patients receiving no unplanned intravenous medication. There was neither procedural nor in-hospital mortality. The performance of TF-TAVI using local analgesia only, managed by a dedicated nurse instead of an anaesthesiologist, was shown to be feasible and safe in a selected group of patients. This strategy may (temporarily) eliminate the need for an anaesthesiologist to be present in the cath lab and enables ongoing TAVI treatment amidst the global COVID-19 crisis.  
Impact of chronic kidney disease on long-term outcome of patients with valvular heart defects.  ;INTRODUCTION: Valvular heart diseases (VHD) are becoming a significant problem in the Polish population. Coexistence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in patients with VHD increases the risk of death and affects further therapeutic strategy. AIM: Analysis impact of CKD on long-term prognosis in patients with VHD. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The inclusion criteria were met by 1025 patients with moderate and severe VHD. Mean observation time was 2528 ± 1454 days. RESULTS: The average age of the studied population was 66.75 (SD = 10.34), male gender was dominant 56% (N = 579). Severe aortic valve stenosis (AVS) occurred in 28.2%, severe mitral valve insufficiency (MVI) in 20%. CKD occurred in 37.1% (N = 380) patients mostly with mitral stenosis (50%, N = 16) and those with severe MVI (44.8%, N = 94). During the observational period, 52.7% (N = 540) deaths were noted. Increased risk of mortality was associated mostly with age (OR: 1.02, 95% CI: 1.00-1.03, p < 0.001), creatinine (OR:1.27, 95% CI: 1.12-1.43, p < 0.001), CKD (OR: 1.30, 95% CI: 1.17-1.44, p < 0.001), reduced ejection fraction (EF) (OR: 0.98, 95% CI: 0.97-0.99, p = 0.01) and coexisting of AVS (OR: 1.19, 95% CI: 1.04-1.35, p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Mitral valve defects more often than aortic valve defects coexist with chronic kidney disease. Regardless of the stage, chronic kidney disease is an additional factor affecting the prognosis in patients with heart defects. Factors increasing the risk of death were age, creatinine concentration and reduced EF. The monitoring of renal function in patients with VHD should be crucial as well as the implementation of treatment at an early stage.

An Overview of First 100 Cardiac Surgery Cases at a Newly Developed Satellite Center in Sukkur, Pakistan.  ;Introduction The aim of this research is to evaluate the in-hospital and early outcomes of the first 100 adult cardiac surgeries performed at a newly developed satellite center in Sukkur, Pakistan. Methods This is an audit of the first 100 adult cardiac surgeries performed at a newly developed satellite center of the National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases (NICVD) at Sukkur, Pakistan, from March 2018 to November 2018 with 12 months of post-operative follow-up. Patients were offered off-pump coronary artery bypass (OPCAB), on-pump coronary artery bypass (ONCAB), mitral valve replacement (MVR), aortic valve replacement (AVR), minimally invasive cardiac surgery (MICS), and congenital adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) procedures by expert faculty of NICVD with a minimum of five years of post-fellowship experience. Results The mean age was 47.11 ± 14.6 years, with a male predominance of 77%. Hypertension and smoking were the most common risk factors that were observed in 32% and 33%, respectively, followed by diabetes and dyslipidemia with a frequency of 20% and 9%, respectively. The mean EuroSCORE (European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation) II for this patient cohort was 1.165 ± 0.50, with a maximum score of 2.3 in one patient. Out of 100 procedures, 51 were ONCAB, 19 were OPCAB, 16 were MVR, three were AVR, nine were ACHD, and two were MICS. Survival status post-operative as well as after one year was 100%. The frequency of post-operative bleeding was 7%, mean post-operative mechanical ventilation time was 213 ± 273 hours, and in-hospital stay was 5.41 ± 0.165 days. Lost to follow-up at one year was 4% (four). During the follow-up assessment, 39.5% of the patients had complained of mild-to-moderate intensity retrosternal pain and 4.2% had superficial surgical site infection of the sternal wound. A significant improvement in functional class was observed in 38.5% of patients, whereas 4.2% (four) had a significant drop in functional class post-operatively. Conclusion Providing tertiary care and early cardiac surgical facility to the people of Sukkur at their doorstep, in a newly developed satellite center, has resulted in improved outcomes, early quality treatment facility, and avoidance of long travel time.  
Bacillus cereus Subacute Native Valve Infective Endocarditis and Its Multiple Complications.  ;Bacillus cereus causing infective endocarditis (IE) in a native valve is an extremely rare event, but it is reported mostly in intravenous drug abusers and other risk factors as immunosuppression, malignancy, and valvular heart disease including prosthetic heart valves. We report a case of B.cereus native mitral valve infective endocarditis in a 58-year-old Sri Lankan male who is not a drug abuser who presented with painless hematuria with reduced urine output. During hospital stay, he developed frequent episodes of brief focal seizures. He had undergone multiple investigations that revealed splenic abscesses, cerebral vasculitis, and glomerular nephritis with positive rheumatoid factor, cytoplasmic antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (C-ANCA), and cryoglobulin. The appropriate antibiotic was the prime therapeutic intervention which carried an excellent prognosis. This case highlights an unusual organism in the blood culture that caused IE warranting thorough physical examination and investigations.  
A rare case of Whipple's disease with endocarditis in a patient with dextrocardia.  ;We report a case of an elderly Caucasian male with past medical history of dextrocardia with situs inversus totalis, polymyalgia rheumatica, history of cryptogenic stroke, and severe mitral regurgitation with mitral valve prolapse, who presented with acute heart failure symptoms, including severe dyspnea on exertion and worsening lower extremity edema in the setting of immunosuppression with steroids for a year-old diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica. One month prior to this presentation, the patient suffered a transient ischemic attack and during the workup, his transthoracic echocardiography showed myxomatous degeneration of posterior mitral leaflet, partially flail, with severe mitral regurgitation, which required mitral valve replacement. Genome sequencing of mitral valve anterior leaflet pathology detected Tropheryma whipplei as a causal agent of culture-negative endocarditis. The patient was treated with 6 weeks of ceftriaxone and ampicillin-sulbactam and further continued trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for 1 year. He continued antibiotic treatment with resolution of shortness of breath along with arthralgia.

Prospective Evaluation of Clinico-Pathological Predictors of Postoperative Atrial Fibrillation: An Ancillary Study From the OPERA Trial.  ;BACKGROUND: Postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) occurs in 30% to 50% of patients undergoing cardiac surgery and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Prospective identification of structural/molecular changes in atrial myocardium that correlate with myocardial injury and precede and predict risk of POAF may identify new molecular pathways and targets for prevention of this common morbid complication. METHODS: Right atrial appendage samples were prospectively collected during cardiac surgery from 239 patients enrolled in the OPERA trial (Omega-3 Fatty Acids for Prevention of Post-Operative Atrial Fibrillation), fixed in 10% buffered formalin, and embedded in paraffin for histology. We assessed general tissue morphology, cardiomyocyte diameters, myocytolysis (perinuclear myofibril loss), accumulation of perinuclear glycogen, interstitial fibrosis, and myocardial gap junction distribution. We also assayed NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide), hs-cTnT, CRP (C-reactive protein), and circulating oxidative stress biomarkers (F2-isoprostanes, F3-isoprostanes, isofurans) in plasma collected before, during, and 48 hours after surgery. POAF was defined as occurrence of postcardiac surgery atrial fibrillation or flutter of at least 30 seconds duration confirmed by rhythm strip or 12-lead ECG. The follow-up period for all arrhythmias was from surgery until hospital discharge or postoperative day 10. RESULTS: Thirty-five percent of patients experienced POAF. Compared with the non-POAF group, they were slightly older and more likely to have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or heart failure. They also had a higher European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation and more often underwent valve surgery. No differences in left atrial size were observed between patients with POAF and patients without POAF. The extent of atrial interstitial fibrosis, cardiomyocyte myocytolysis, cardiomyocyte diameter, glycogen score or Cx43 distribution at the time of surgery was not significantly associated with incidence of POAF. None of these histopathologic abnormalities were correlated with levels of NT-proBNP, hs-cTnT, CRP, or oxidative stress biomarkers. CONCLUSIONS: In sinus rhythm patients undergoing cardiac surgery, histopathologic changes in the right atrial appendage do not predict POAF. They also do not correlate with biomarkers of cardiac function, inflammation, and oxidative stress. Graphic Abstract: A graphic abstract is available for this article.  
Determinants of clinical outcomes in patients with mixed mitral valve disease.  ;BACKGROUND: Although significant stenosis and regurgitation can be observed on a single heart valve, studies on the outcome predictors for mixed valve disease are limited. The purpose of the current study was to investigate the fate and determinants of clinical outcomes in patients with mixed single mitral valve disease who have concomitant mitral stenosis (MS) and mitral regurgitation (MR). METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 82 consecutive patients with rheumatic heart disease who had both significant MS (MVA ≤ 1.5 cm2 ) and at least moderate MR, excluding patients with significant aortic valve stenosis or regurgitation. The primary endpoint was a composite of all-cause mortality during follow-up, mitral valve replacement, heart failure admission, and stroke. RESULTS: There were 37 events (45.1%), 5 all-cause deaths (6.0%), and 32 mitral valve replacements (39.0%). In a multivariable Cox regression analysis, a transmitral mean pressure gradient (TMPG) over 6 mm Hg was the only independent echocardiographic predictor for events (hazard ratio 3.69, 95% confidential interval 1.31-10.44, P = .014), after adjusting for sex, age, symptoms, and the severity of MS and MR. The estimated 6-year event-free survival rate was significantly lower in patients with TMPG ≥ 6 mm Hg than in those with TMPG < 6 mm Hg (76.3% vs 22.9%, log-rank P < .001). CONCLUSION: Transmitral mean pressure gradient, which reflects the hemodynamic burden of the mitral valve lesion, appears to be the most important echocardiographic predictor of clinical outcomes in patients with mixed mitral valve disease.  
Mechanistic implications of altered protein expression in rheumatic heart disease.  ;Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) is a major cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in low- and middle-income countries, where living conditions promote spread of group A β-haemolytic streptococcus. Autoimmune reactions due to molecular mimicry of bacterial epitopes by host proteins cause acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and subsequent disease progression to RHD. Despite knowledge of the factors that predispose to ARF and RHD, determinants of the progression to valvular damage and the molecular events involved remain incompletely characterised. This review focuses on altered protein expression in heart valves, myocardial tissue and plasma of patients with RHD and pathogenic consequences on RHD. Proteins mainly involved in structural organization of the valve matrix, blood homeostasis and immune response were altered due to RHD pathogenesis. Study of secreted forms of these proteins may aid the development of non-invasive biomarkers for early diagnosis and monitoring outcomes in RHD. Valve replacement surgery, the single evidence-based strategy to improve outcomes in severe RHD, is costly, largely unavailable in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) and requires specialised facilities. When diagnosed early, penicillin prophylaxis may be used to delay progression to severe valvular damage. Echocardiography and cardiovascular magnetic resonance and the standard imaging tools recommended to confirm early diagnosis remain largely unavailable and inaccessible in most LMIC and both require expensive equipment and highly skilled persons for manipulation as well as interpretation of results. Changes in protein expression in heart valves and myocardium are associated with progressive valvular deformation in RHD. Understanding these protein changes should shed more light on the mechanisms of pathogenicity, while secreted forms of these proteins may provide leads towards a biomarker for non-invasive early detection of RHD.  
Assessment of Disease Progression in Patients With Repaired Tetralogy of Fallot Using Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging: A Systematic Review.  ;AIMS: Tetralogy of Fallot (ToF) is the most common cyanotic congenital heart disease with a growing population of adult survivors. Late pulmonary outflow tract and pulmonary valve postoperative complications are frequent, leading to long-term risks such as right heart failure and sudden death secondary to arrhythmias. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) is the gold standard for assessment of cardiac function in patients with repaired ToF. We aimed to determine the most useful CMR predictors of disease progression and the optimal frequency of CMR. METHODS AND RESULTS: We systematically reviewed PubMed from inception until 29 April 2019 for longitudinal studies assessing the relationship between CMR features and disease progression in repaired ToF. Fourteen (14) studies were identified. Multiple studies showed that impaired right and left ventricular function predict subsequent disease progression. Right ventricular end diastolic volume, while being associated with disease progression when analysed alone, was generally not associated with disease progression on multivariate analysis. Severity of tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary regurgitation likewise did not show a consistent association with subsequent events. A number of non-CMR factors were also identified as being associated with disease progression, in particular QRS duration and older age at repair. Restrictive right ventricular physiology was not consistently an independent predictor of events. CONCLUSION: Impaired right and left ventricular function are the most consistent independent predictors of disease progression in repaired ToF. The optimal timing of repeat cardiac imaging remains controversial. Large scale prospective studies will provide important information to guide clinical decision making in this area.  
Truncus arteriosus repair: A 40-year multicenter perspective.  ;"OBJECTIVE: To examine the long-term surgical outcomes of patients who underwent truncus arteriosus (TA) repair. METHODS: Between 1979 and 2018, a total of 255 patients underwent TA repair at 3 Australian hospitals. Data were obtained by review of medical records from initial admission until last cardiology follow-up. RESULTS: At the time of TA repair, the median patient age was 44 days, and median weight was 3.5 kg. Early mortality was 13.3% (34 of 255), and overall survival was 76.8 ± 2.9% at 20 years. Neonatal surgery and low operative weight were risk factors for early mortality. Most deaths (82.5%; 47 of 57) occurred within the first year following repair. A coronary artery anomaly and early reoperation were identified as risk factors for late mortality. A total of 175 patients required at least 1 reoperation, with overall freedom of reoperation of 2.9 ± 1.5% at 20 years. Follow-up of survivors was 96% complete (191 of 198). The median duration of follow-up was 16.4 years. At the last follow-up, 190 patients were categorized as New York Heart Association class I/II, and 1 patient was class III. CONCLUSIONS: TA repair during the neonatal period presents significant surgical challenges. Neonates with signs of overcirculation should be operated on promptly. A coronary artery anomaly is a risk factor for late mortality. Survival beyond the first year following repair is associated with excellent outcomes.  "
Pulsatility in ventricular assistance devices: A translational review focused on applied haemodynamics.  ;Heart failure affects more than 30 million people worldwide and its prevalence is constantly rising. In 2020, heart transplantation is the only curative treatment, but left ventricular assistance devices (LVADs) are fully integrated into the decision algorithm for management of patients with advanced heart failure, with more than 20,000 devices implanted worldwide in the last decade. Intended to support cardiac output, LVADs remove the blood from the left ventricle and eject it into the proximal aorta. Whereas first-generation LVADs were pulsatile, second- and third-generation LVADs are more reliable, but create a laminar flow, with reduced (or absent) blood flow pulsatility. Concomitantly, several new adverse events, some of them lethal, appeared when continuous-flow LVADs started to be implanted, including acquired von Willebrand disease, gastrointestinal bleeding and aortic valve fusion or regurgitation. This review aims to apply models describing pulsatility (such as the Windkessel effect applied by Frank, Guyton's continuity model of venous return and Sunagawa's left ventricular-arterial coupling) to LVADs, to better understand the physiopathology in patients using continuous-flow devices. This review also covers the means of exploring pulsatility and adverse events associated with a reduction in pulsatility, as well as the possible ways for restoring pulsatility in patients implanted with an LVAD.  
Mini-sternotomy vs right anterior thoracotomy for aortic valve replacement.  ;"BACKGROUND: While minimally invasive techniques for aortic valve replacement (AVR) have been shown to be safe, limited data exist comparing the varying approaches. This study aimed to compare the outcomes between two minimally invasive approaches for AVR: mini-sternotomy (MS) and right anterior thoracotomy (RAT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and OVID was conducted for the period 1990-2019. Nine observational studies (n = 2926 patients) met the inclusion criteria. RESULTS: There was no difference in operative mortality between MS and RAT (odds ratio [OR]: 0.87, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.41-1.85; P = .709). Meta-analyses favored MS over RAT in reoperation for bleeding (OR: 0.42, 95% CI: 0.28-0.63; P < .001), aortic cross-clamp time (standardized mean difference [SMD]: -0.12, 95% CI: -0.20 to 0.029; P = .009), and the rate of conversion to sternotomy (OR: 0.32, 95% CI: 0.11-0.93; P = .036). The rate of permanent pacemaker insertion approached borderline significance in favor of MS (OR: 0.54, 95% CI: 0.26-1.12; P = .097). In-hospital outcomes of stroke, atrial fibrillation, and surgical site infection were similar between the two groups. The length of hospital stay was shorter for RAT (SMD: 0.12, 95% CI: 0.027-0.22; P = .012) and the length of postoperative ventilation was borderline significant in favor of RAT (SMD: 0.16, 95% CI: -0.027 to 0.34; P = .095). CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights important differences in short-term outcomes between MS and RAT as approaches for AVR. This has important implications for patient selection, especially in the elderly, where such approaches are becoming more common-place.  "
Tricuspid annuloplasty: Too many, too few? Virtue may be in the middle!  ;BACKGROUND: Significant secondary tricuspid regurgitation, often accompanied by right ventricular dilation and dysfunction, occurs in a significant proportion of patients submitted to surgery for severe mitral valve disease. It appears a vicious circle that is not interrupted by the treatment of the left heart valve alone, hence it requires concomitant intervention on the tricuspid valve. AIMS: In this commentary I will discuss a paper published in this issue of the Journal by Calafiore et al from Riyadh - Saudi Arabia, reporting a retrospective study that evaluated the influence of preoperative right ventricular and tricuspid valve (TV) remodeling on the fate of tricuspid annuloplasty (TA) and RV in 423 patients undergoing TA for functional TR operated on from May 2009 to December 2015 at their institution. MATERIALS & METHODS: Current guidelines and other consensus documents recommend that tricuspid valve surgeryshould be considered (class IIa) in patients with mild/moderate secondary regurgitation and/or significant annular dilatation. However, rates of tricuspid annuloplasty performed during operations to left-heart valves are very variable, depending also on the etiology of the mitral disease. RESULTS & DISCUSSION: Different methods of annuloplasty are used by the surgical community - suture, rings, bands - with widely variable results with regard to the recurrence of regurgitation and long-term survival. Not all these techniques are standardised and this may also be a cause for the disparate results. CONCLUSION: In the absence of randomized studies, which are highly unlikely to be undertaken in this situation, more information is required from large series with longer follow-ups.  
Alcohol septal ablation: A useful tool in our arsenal against hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy.  ;"OBJECTIVE: Affecting 1 in 500 individuals; hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is an autosomal dominant cardiovascular disorder which is prevalent throughout the world. Surgical myectomy (SM) and alcohol septal ablation (ASA) are two methods currently used for the management of drug refractory hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). ASA may prove to be a useful, less invasive treatment in patients with HOCM METHODS: Electronic literature search was conducted to identify articles that discussed methods to treat drug refractory HOCM. No limits were placed on timing of the publication or the type of article. Keywords and MeSH terms were used and the results were summarized in the relevant section. RESULTS: Current evidence suggests that alcohol septal ablation is a safe and effective procedure in treating patients with HOCM with similar short- and long-term outcomes when compared with SM. CONCLUSION: ASA has been shown to be a safe and reliable procedure; imaging techniques and dedicated multi-disciplinary teams can be used to select patients with HOCM. Though SM is recommended as gold standard treatment for drug refractory HOCM, ASA may play an increasing role in the near future due an ageing population; both ASA and SM can have a beneficial role in treating those who are affected by HOCM when the appropriate group of patients are selected for each intervention.

Long-term risk of heart failure and mortality following mitral valve surgery in patients with and without right ventricular pacemaker.  ;OBJECTIVES: Patients undergoing mitral valve surgery are at risk of developing postoperative conduction blocks and have a high incidence of heart failure (HF). Mitral valve surgery often results in reduced left ventricular systolic ejection fraction following surgery and the imposition of dyssynchrony with right ventricular (RV) pacing may further compromise stroke volume. Our aim was to investigate the risks of HF and mortality in patients with vs without RV pacemaker placement (PPM) after mitral valve surgery. METHODS: Using Danish nationwide databases, we identified all patients undergoing mitral valve repair or replacement surgery between 1997 and 2017, who were free from HF at baseline. The association of PPM implanted within 30 days following surgery with long-term risks of HF and mortality was investigated by multivariable Cox regression models. RESULTS: Of 4072 patients (33% female), 248 (6%) had a PPM implanted at 30-day postsurgery. Patients with PPM were older (68 vs 63 years), had a higher prevalence of concomitant aortic valve surgery (15% vs 11%), ischemic heart disease (13% vs 8%), and atrial fibrillation (19% vs 12%), compared with patients without PPM. Over a median follow-up of 5 years, 68 (27%) vs 825 (22%) patients with vs without PPM developed HF and 74 (30%) vs 1018 (27%) died. In multivariable-adjusted models, the hazard ratios associated with PPM were 1.00 (0.78-1.30), P = .93 for HF, and .96 (0.76-1.21), P = .72 for mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative implantation of a permanent RV pacemaker does not alter the long-term risks of HF and mortality following mitral valve surgery.  
Protek Duo Rapid Deployment cannulation utilized to bridge to durable heartware left ventricular assist device.  ;A 43-year-old gentleman was transferred for management of acute on chronic cardiogenic shock (left ventricular ejection fraction < 10%). Upon arrival, we inserted a left axillary intra-aortic balloon pump for hemodynamic support. He underwent an emergent left and right-heart catheterization which showed patent stents and coronaries, in the setting of severely elevated pulmonary artery and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. On hospital day 35, we escalated support to Centrimag in conjunction with a 31 French Protek Duo Rapid Deployment cannula. A centrimag cannula apical sewing cuff was sewn in continuous fashion along the left ventricular apex. Via modified seldinger technique, we tunneled the Protek Duo Rapid Deployment cannula through the silastic sewing cuff and the ventricular apex, traversing the aortic valve. On hospital day 50, he underwent left anterior thoracotomy and mini-sternotomy for implantation of durable Heartware left ventricular assist device. He was discharged home off inotropes and had resumed his normal activities. He is currently listed as status four for heart transplantation.  
Current trends in the management of acute type A aortic intramural hematoma.  ;"Within the spectrum of acute aortic syndromes, intramural hematoma (IMH) is a distinct lesion that is characterized by crescentic or circumferential thickening of the aortic wall in the absence of an intimal defect. The reported incidence of IMH among all type A acute aortic syndromes ranges from 3.5% to 28.3%. As compared with acute aortic dissection, IMH is a disease of the elderly, and it tends to have reduced rates of malperfusion syndromes, aortic insufficiency, and root dilation, yet also tends to have increased rates of pericardial effusion, cardiac tamponade, and periaortic hematoma. With respect to natural history, IMH may progress to classic dissection, frank rupture, or aneurysmal dilation; yet, IMH may also regress and be completely resorbed. However, studies disagree over the rates of progression or regression; as such, few studies agree on the short-term and long-term prognosis associated with IMH. American and European guidelines advocate emergent surgery for all acutely presenting type A IMH. At a minimum, supracoronary replacement of the aorta with hemiarch reconstruction is the preferred extent of operative repair to reduce rates of long-term reintervention for disease progression. However, valve and/or root procedures may be necessary proximally, while total arch reconstruction or hybrid procedures for the descending aorta may be necessary distally. Much remains unknown for IMH, including the ideal extent of aortic repair, risk-stratification for elderly patients, and the optimal treatment paradigm for stable, uncomplicated IMH. As such, IMH remains a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge for the cardiovascular surgeon.  "
Late tricuspid regurgitation and right ventricular remodeling after tricuspid annuloplasty.  ;BACKGROUND: The aim of the present retrospective study was to evaluate the influence of preoperative right ventricular (RV) and tricuspid valve (TV) remodeling on the fate of tricuspid annuloplasty (TA) and right ventricle. METHODS: From May 2009 to December 2015, 423 patients who had undergone TA for functional tricuspid regurgitation (TR) were included in the study. Residual and recurrent TR were defined as moderate or more TR at discharge and follow-up, respectively. RV remodeling was defined as RV dysfunction and/or dilation. RESULTS: Residual TR after TA was recorded in 54 patients (13%). Five-year freedom from TR recurrence was 81% ± 3% in patients without residual TR and 41 ± 8 in patients with residual TR (P < .001). In patients without residual TR, the following risk factors for recurrent TR and late RV remodeling were identified: preoperative systolic pulmonary artery pressure, preoperative RV remodeling, severe preoperative TR or less than severe TR but with TV apparatus remodeling, and etiology of mitral regurgitation. Cox analysis with time-dependent variables confirmed TR recurrence (hazard ratio [HR]: 3.1) and late RV remodeling (HR: 6.5) as risk factors for lower survival. No protective effect of either flexible band or rigid ring TA compared with DeVega procedure was found. Similarly, preoperative atrial fibrillation and pacemaker dependency, late failure of mitral valve surgery did not affect the fate of TR. CONCLUSIONS: Prophylactic TA should be encouraged among surgeons. TA at the time of left-sided valve surgery should take into consideration not only annular size, but also tethering severity and RV remodeling.  
Giant ascending aortic aneurysm after aortic valve replacement.  ;Giant ascending aortic aneurysms are rare clinical entities and are accompanied by a high annual risk of rupture. We present the imaging, intraoperative, and pathology findings of such a case.  
Rates, predictors, and outcomes of early readmissions after tricuspid valve surgery.  ;"BACKGROUND: The data on readmissions following tricuspid valve repair/replacement (TVR) are scarce. We examined rates, predictors, causes, and outcomes of readmissions after TVR, using the National Readmission Database. METHODS: The International Classification of Diseases-9th version was used to identify the patients who underwent isolated TVR or concomitant aortic, mitral, and coronary bypass surgeries. Rates, causes, and outcomes were assessed using the analysis of variance and the χ2 test, and predictors of readmissions were evaluated using multivariate analysis. RESULTS: A total of 8254 patients who underwent TVR during 2013 to 2014 were included, of whom 1994 (24.16%) were isolated, and 6260 (75.84%) were performed concomitantly with other heart valve or coronary bypass surgery. A total of 1720 (20.84%) patients were readmitted within 30 days. The readmission rates were 448 (22.46%) after isolated TVR and similar after concomitant TVR (TVR + aortic valve replacement, TVR + mitral valve repair, TVR + coronary artery bypass graft, and TVR + multiple) (P = .194); whereas 1305 (20.11%) and 414 (23.45%) were after tricuspid valve repair and replacement (P = .080), respectively. The independent predictors of readmission were acute kidney injury during index visit and Charlson comorbidity index of more than 2. Mean time to readmission and median length of stay during readmission were 13.02 (±7.93) and 5 (interquartile range: 3-9) days, respectively. Total mortality during rehospitalization was 105 (6.1%), a very high (26.86%) number of patients were discharged to skilled facilities after readmission. CONCLUSIONS: One out of five patients were readmitted within 30 days after the TVR, associated with 6.1% mortality during rehospitalization, and very high need for skilled facility placement.  "
Mitro-aortic valve-in-valve procedures: Many challenges in little space.  ;Multiple valve replacements are known to carry additional risk of morbidity and mortality in redo context. Currently, a transcatheter-based valve-in-valve approach could be useful in reducing potential serious consequences. On the other hand, this approach poses several technical challenges regarding the device and the procedural aspects. We present the case of a 78-year-old man who presented with symptoms of heart failure due to mitral and aortic bioprosthesis degenerations who was deemed to be at extremely high risk for a conventional redo surgery. A two-step transcatheter-based approach was planned and a transfemoral aortic valve-in-valve procedure was followed by a transapical mitral valve-in-valve implantation with a favorable early and long-term outcome.  
Cervical origin of right subclavian artery associated with tetralogy of Fallot.  ;We present a case of an infant with tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary atresia with an incidentally detected cervical origin of right subclavian artery. We highlight the importance of identifying this rare variation and the potential complications that may ensue.

Unexpected mechanism of mitral regurgitation in a patient post ALCAPA repair: Added value of three-dimensional echocardiography.  ;Accurate assessment of etiology of mitral regurgitation (MR) is one of the key steps in the decision-making process and further clinical management of patients with severe MR. Our clinical case illustrates the added value of three-dimensional echocardiography (3DE) in assessment of mitral valve morphology and identification of an unexpected mechanism of MR which was not previously diagnosed using conventional echocardiography. 3DE helped to choose appropriate management strategy in this patient.  
Intraventricular entrapment of a Sapien-3 balloon in transapical TAVR: A near missed catastrophe.  ;Balloon rupture is an uncommon complication during balloon-expandable transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). We describe a balloon rupture and tearing with intraventricular entrapment complicating transapical-TAVR, as well as our bailout retrieval of the failed device.  
Successful Preoperative Optimization for Lung Transplantation with Transcatheter Mitral Valve Repair.  ;Surgically treatable valvular heart disease is common in patients with end-stage lung disease. Nevertheless, advanced lung disease is often seen as a contra-indication for cardiac surgery and severe valvular disease is seen as a contra-indication for lung transplantation. We describe the case of a patient presenting with very severe COPD and severe mitral regurgitation who was managed with transcatheter mitral valve repair to subsequently undergo a successful lung transplant. Critical valvular heart disease in patients with chronic respiratory failure may be amenable to transcatheter therapy and favorably impact lung transplant candidacy.  
Characteristics and Prognosis of Patients With Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation and Significant Valvular Heart Disease Referred for Electrical Cardioversion.  ;Valvular atrial fibrillation (AF) is defined as AF in the presence of mitral stenosis or mechanical valve prosthesis. However, there are patients with AF who have significant native valvular heart disease (VHD) others than mitral stenosis that are classified as nonvalvular AF. The characteristics and prognostic implications of these entities have not been extensively studied. Of 1,885 AF patients referred for electrical cardioversion (64 ± 13years, 71% male), 171 (9.1%) had valvular AF (any grade of mitral stenosis or mechanical/biological valve prostheses) and 1,714 patients were identified as nonvalvular AF, of whom 329 (17.5%) had significant left-sided VHD. Patients with nonvalvular AF but with significant left-sided VHD were older, more frequently women and had more co-morbidities compared with the other groups. Furthermore, nonvalvular AF patients with significant left-sided VHD showed the worst left ventricular systolic function and largest left atrial volumes. During a median follow-up of 64 months (interquartile range: 33 to 96 months), 488 patients presented with the combined endpoint of all-cause mortality, heart failure hospitalization, and ischemic stroke. Patients with nonvalvular AF and with significant left-sided VHD had more events of heart failure whereas patients with valvular AF had higher all-cause mortality events. There were no differences in ischemic stroke events. Type of AF was not associated with outcomes after correcting for echocardiographic variables. In conclusion, the frequency of AF patients with significant VHD is relatively high. The consequences of VHD and AF on cardiac structure and function are more important determinants of adverse outcome than the type of AF.  
Prediction and Prevention of Sudden Death in Young Patients (<20 years) With Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy.  ;"Highly reliable identification of adults with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HC) at risk for sudden death (SD) has been reported. A significant controversy remains, however, regarding the most reliable risk stratification methodology for children and adolescents with HC. The present study assesses the accuracy of SD prediction and prevention with prophylactic implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) in young HC patients. The study group is comprised of 146 HC patients <20 years of age evaluated consecutively over 17 years with prospective risk stratification and ICD decision-making. We relied on ≥1 established individual risk markers considered major within each patient's clinical profile, based on an enhanced American College of Cardiology /American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines algorithm. Of the 60 largely asymptomatic patients implanted with primary prevention ICDs at age 15 ± 4 years, 9 (15%) experienced device therapy terminating potentially lethal ventricular tachyarrhythmias and restoring sinus rhythm at 19 ± 6 years (range 9 to 29), 5.1 ± 6.0 years after implant; 3 patients had multiple appropriate ICD discharges. The individual risk marker algorithm was associated with 100% sensitivity in predicting SD events (95%CI: 69, 100) and 63% specificity for identifying patients without events (95%CI: 54, 71). Of these patients with device therapy, massive left ventricular hypertrophy (absolute wall thickness ≥30 mm) was the most common predictor, present in 70% of patients either alone or in combination with other risk markers. Each of the 146 study patients have survived to date at 22 ± 5 years, including all 86 without ICD recommendations. In conclusion, an enhanced ACC/AHA risk stratification strategy, based on established individual risk markers, was highly reliable in prospectively predicting SD events in children and adolescents with HC, and preventing arrhythmia-based catastrophes in this susceptible high risk population.

Characteristics and Implications of Left Atrial Calcium on Cardiac Computed Tomography in Patients With Earlier Mitral Valve Operation.  ;Left atrial calcium (LAC) is often observed in patients who have undergone mitral valve (MV) surgery, but little is known about its characteristics and clinical implications. Therefore, we sought to investigate the structural and hemodynamic significance of LAC and its association with clinical outcomes. We investigated 327 patients with repaired or prosthetic MV who underwent cardiac CT from 2010 to 2017. The degree of LAC was analyzed and classified into three groups: group 1 (no LAC), group 2 (mild-to-moderate LAC), and group 3 (severe LAC). Clinical and echocardiographic characteristics and clinical outcomes were compared in three groups. LAC was seen in 79 (24.2%) patients. Groups 2 and 3 showed more prevalent atrial fibrillation, a rheumatic etiology, a higher number of previous surgeries, a larger LA volume index, and higher pulmonary artery systolic pressure than group 1. Paravalvular leakage of the MV increased progressively according to severity of LAC (15.4% in group 1, 39.3% in group 2, and 66.7% in group 3, p <0.001). Event-free survival rate for major adverse cardiovascular adverse events (log rank p = 0.033) and all-cause mortality (log rank p <0.001) were significantly different according to LAC group. In Cox regression analyses, presence of severe LAC was an independent predictor of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio: 4.44, 95% confidence interval: 1.71 to 11.58, p = 0.002). LAC on cardiac CT is not uncommon and reflects more advanced LA remodeling and a stiff LA. The presence and severity of LAC are associated with a worse clinical outcome after MV surgery.  
Effect of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation on the Immune Response Associated With Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement.  ;"The immune response after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in comparison to that after surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) remains to be fully elucidated. In a 2-part study, we assessed laboratory data obtained before, immediately after, and 24 and 48 hours after SAVR (128 patients; age ≥80 [mean 82] years) or transfemoral TAVI (102 patients; age ≥80 [mean 86] years) performed for aortic stenosis. In-hospital mortalities were similar (3% vs 0%), but leukocyte counts and aspartate aminotransferase and creatine kinas concentrations were decreased immediately and 24 hours after surgery (all, p <0.001). We performed cytokine profiling in a SAVR group (11 patients; mean age, 77 years) and transfemoral TAVI group (12 patients; mean age, 84 years). By measuring normalized concentrations of 71 cytokines at 3 time points, we found a significant difference (defined as fold change >1.7 and p <0.05 [by Mann-Whitney U-test]) in 23 cytokines. The differentially expressed cytokines fell into 3 hierarchical clusters: cluster A (high increase after SAVR and suppressed increase after TAVI only immediately after surgery [CCL2, CCL4, and 2 others]), cluster B (high increase after SAVR and suppressed increase after TAVI at 2 time points [IL-1Ra, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and 5 others]), and cluster C (various patterns [TRAIL, CCL11, and 8 others]). Gene enrichment analysis identified multiple pathways associated with the inflammatory responses in SAVR and altered responses in TAVI, including cellular responses to tumor necrosis factor (p = 0.0035) and interleukin-1 (p = 0.0062). In conclusion, a robust inflammatory response follows SAVR, and a comparatively attenuated response follows TAVI.  "
"Progression of Normal Flow Low Gradient ""Severe"" Aortic Stenosis With Preserved Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction.  ";"Normal-flow low-gradient severe aortic stenosis (NF-LG-SAS), defined by an aortic valve area (AVA) <1 cm², mean pressure gradient (MPG) <40 mm Hg and indexed stroke volume ≥35 ml/m², is the most prevalent form of low-gradient aortic stenosis (AS) with preserved ejection fraction (PEF). However, the true severity of AS in these patients is controversial. The aim of this Doppler echocardiographic study was to investigate changes over time in the hemodynamic severity of patients with NF-LG-SAS with PEF. We retrospectively identified 96 patients who had 2 Doppler echocardiographic examinations without an intervening event. After a median follow-up of 25 (interquartile range 15 to 52) months, progression was observed, with increased transaortic MPG (from 28 [25 to 33] to 39 [34 to 50] mm Hg; p<0.001), peak aortic jet velocity (from 3.46 [3.20 to 3.64] to 4.01 [3.70 to 4.39] m/s; p<0.001), and decreased AVA (from 0.87 [0.82 to 0.94] to 0.72 [0.62 to 0.81] cm²; p<0.001). Median annual rates of progression were 4.3 (1.7 to 8.1) mm Hg/year, 0.25 (0.08 to 0.44) m/s/year, and -0.05 (-0.10 to -0.02) cm²/year, respectively. There was no significant change in left ventricular ejection fraction over time (p = 0.74). At follow-up, 46 patients (48%) acquired the features of classical high-gradient severe AS (MPG ≥40 mm Hg). This study shows that most patients with NF-LG-SAS with PEF exhibit significant hemodynamic progression of AS severity without EF impairment. These findings suggest that NF-LG-SAS with PEF is an ""intermediate"" stage between moderate AS and classical high-gradient severe AS requiring close monitoring.  "
Echocardiographic findings on aortic stenosis: an observational, prospective, and multi-center registry.  ;BACKGROUND: The aim of this aortic stenosis registry was to investigate the changes of routine echocardiographic indices and strain in patients with moderate-to-severe aortic stenosis over a 6-month follow-up period. METHODS: Our aortic stenosis registry is observational, prospective, multicenter registry of nine countries, with 197 patients with aortic valve area less than 1.5 cm2. The enrolment took place from January to August 2017. We excluded patients with uncontrolled atrial arrhythmias, pulmonary hypertension or cardiomyopathies, as well as those with hemodynamically significant valvular disease other than aortic stenosis. We included patients who did not require intervention and who had a complete follow-up study. RESULTS: In patients with preserved ejection fraction, left ventricular mass has significantly increased between baseline and follow-up studies (218 ± 34 grams vs 253 ± 29 grams, p = 0.02). However, when indexed to body surface area, there was no significant difference. Left ventricular global longitudinal strain significantly decreased (-19.7 ± -4.8 vs (-16.4 vs -3.8, p = 0.01). Left atrial volume was significantly higher at follow-up (p = 0.035). Right ventricular basal diameter and mid-cavity diameter were greater at the follow-up (p = 0.04 and p = 0.035, respectively). Patients with low-flow low-gradient aortic stenosis had significantly lower global longitudinal strain (-12.3% ± -3.9% vs -19.7% ± -4.8%, p = 0.01). CONCLUSION: Left atrial dilatation is one of the first changes to take place in low-flow low-gradient aortic stenosis patients even when left ventricular dimensions and function remains intact. Global longitudinal strain is an important determinant of left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction and right ventricular function is an important parameter of aortic stenosis assessment. Accordingly, our registry has further shed the light on these indices role as multisite follow-up of aortic stenosis.  
The Sky Is Not Falling: Surgical Perspectives on a New Transcatheter Paradigm.  ;The role of cardiac surgeons in the treatment of aortic valve disease is changing with the expansion of transcatheter aortic valve replacement. Recent trials in patients at low surgical risk will further this paradigm shift, and the future cardiac surgeons in this space remain uncertain. In this Viewpoint article, we discuss the role that surgeons can play in the future of structural heart medicine. We examine the potential effects of the low-risk transcatheter aortic valve replacement trials on overall operative volumes and how these effects may be limited through structured training programs and strong collaboration within the heart team. Finally, future considerations and cautions for the cardiac surgical community are discussed. The coming era presents an opportunity for growth, leadership, and strong interdisciplinary collaboration for the cardiac surgery community.  
Duplex echocardiography in multivalvular heart disease after percutaneous mitral valve repair?  ;DOI: 10.1111/eci.13340 PMID: 32649782  
Assessment and management of coronary artery disease in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement.  ;PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Coronary artery disease (CAD) is commonly observed in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Significant variability exists across institutions for strategies used for CAD diagnosis and its management. The heart team often relies upon traditional practice patterns and the decision for revascularization by percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is influenced by patient, angiographic, operator, and system-related factors. RECENT FINDINGS: Contemporary coronary tomography angiography (CTA) shows significant promise for detection of clinically important CAD and preliminary data support CTA use for TAVR patients. The prognostic implications of CAD in a TAVR population remain unclear with studies showing conflicting data for the benefits of PCI. Recent trials show that medical management is an effective initial treatment strategy for stable CAD, a finding likely also applicable for asymptomatic and stable TAVR patients. In addition, PCI performed pre-TAVR, concomitant with TAVR or after TAVR has been shown to produce similar outcomes. Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is mandated after PCI but associated with increased risk of bleeding in TAVR population with accumulating evidence for single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT) post-TAVR unless DAPT or anticoagulation is indicated for another reason. SUMMARY: Although coronary angiography remains the predominant modality for CAD assessment, CTA is increasingly being used in TAVR patients. There is limited evidence to guide CAD management in TAVR patients with significant variability in practice patterns. Medical therapy is recommended for asymptomatic and stable CAD patients with applicability for TAVR population. Despite prior concerns, recent studies suggest successful coronary access post-TAVR and similar outcomes for PCI offered pre-TAVR, concomitant with TAVR and post-TAVR settings. Safety of DAPT should be an important consideration for PCI in TAVR patients. Ongoing studies will determine the preferred testing for CAD diagnosis, benefit of revascularization, timing of PCI, and optimum antithrombotic therapy for TAVR populations.  
Mitral regurgitation: a contemporary review of percutaneous mitral valve repair and role of periprocedural imaging.  ;PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article aims to review recent landmark clinical trials that have resulted in a paradigm shift in the management of patients with mitral regurgitation. This article additionally highlights the instrumental role that structural heart disease (SHD) imaging plays in evaluation of mitral regurgitation and determining candidacy for transcatheter mitral valve repair (TMVr), in addition to the procedural guidance and detection of complications. RECENT FINDINGS: Edge-to-edge TMVr with the MitraClip device (Abbott Vascular, Santa Clara, California) was initially studied and subsequently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of primary mitral regurgitation in 2013. After the publication of a landmark clinical trial in 2018, the indications have been expanded and FDA has subsequently, in 2019, approved TMVr for patients with functional mitral regurgitation. This has been paralleled by advances in cardiac imaging with more emphasis on the role of SHD imagers as a part of the heart team. SUMMARY: TMVr has revolutionized the management of mitral regurgitation and relies heavily on SHD imaging to ensure optimal outcomes.  
A comparison of surgical, total percutaneous, and hybrid approaches to treatment of combined coronary artery and valvular heart disease.  ;PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review is to compare outcomes of surgical valve replacement (SVR) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), minimally invasive cardiac surgery (MICS) SVR and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and transcatheter aortic valve replacement and PCI for the treatment of combined coronary artery disease (CAD) and valvular heart disease (VHD). RECENT FINDINGS: Several studies have attempted to identify key differences in outcomes with hybrid MICS SVR and PCI approaches to combined CAD and VHD. Recent studies have demonstrated that MICS SVR and PCI, when compared with conventional open SVR and CABG, demonstrate reduced or unchanged morbidity and mortality. However, the rate of bleeding in MICS SVR and PCI is consistently higher likely because of the effects of antiplatelet therapy. SUMMARY: A shift toward MICS has occurred in the preceding decades, with outcomes improving in recent years. With limited ability to perform CABG through MICS approaches, attempts have been made at hybrid procedures to address multiple presenting concerns while allowing for the benefits of MICS approaches. Hybrid MICS SVR and PCI approaches may provide suitable alternatives to traditional surgical approaches with reduced intra and postoperative morbidity and mortality, with the notable exception of bleeding complications.  
Imaging in mitral stenosis.  ;PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Mitral stenosis remains clinically relevant in developing countries where rheumatic heart disease is the predominant culprit. In the western world, mitral annular and valvular calcification is an increasingly recognized cause, particularly in an aging population. Echocardiography plays a primary role in imaging mitral stenosis with a growing role for cardiac computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. In this review, we aim to revisit mitral stenosis assessment and quantification using multimodality imaging. RECENT FINDINGS: There is an increasing role for advanced cardiac imaging especially in the era of transcatheter mitral valve intervention. Also, when echocardiography is suboptimal or discordant with symptoms, computed tomography can provide anatomical data, whereas magnetic resonance imaging can provide anatomical along with hemodynamic data. SUMMARY: Diagnosis of mitral stenosis is crucial as it carries an increased morbidity and mortality risk. Echocardiography is the cornerstone imaging modality with alternative, complementary advanced imaging considered when images are suboptimal.  
Antibody microarray analysis of serum inflammatory cytokines in patients with calcific aortic valve disease.  ;BACKGROUND: Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is a slowly progressive pathologic process associated with significant morbidity and mortality, CAVD is the most common valve heart disease in the elderly and a leading cause of aortic valve stenosis. Multiple steps characterize the process: inflammation, cell apoptosis, lipid deposition, renin-angiotensin system activation, extracellular matrix remodeling, and bone formation. This paper focuses on detecting and analyzing the expression of serum inflammatory factors in CAVD by antibody microarray techniques. METHODS: In this study, a total of 258 patients were included at Tianjin Chest Hospital between January 2017 and December 2018, subjects were divided into three groups: control, coronary artery disease (CAD), and CAVD. Blood samples were collected, and adipokine/cytokine/chemokine serum profiles were measured by antibody arrays. RESULTS: These data suggest that B-Lymphocyte Chemoattractant (BLC), Interleukin (IL)-12p40, monokine inducible by γ interferon (MIG), and Macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1delta were significantly increased in CAVD compared to control or CAD. Furthermore, Real-time quantified PCR, Western blot assay, and Flow cytometer detection showed that these four cytokines/chemokines were from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that BLC, IL-12p40, MIG, and MIP-1delta can be used as a marker to assess CAVD, which could have significant clinical implications.

The Second Time Around: Reinterventions for Transcatheter Pulmonary Valves.  ;DOI: 10.1016/j.jcin.2020.05.016 PMID: 32646694  
Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in Patients With Multivalvular Heart Disease.  ;As transcatheter aortic valve replacement becomes a more dominant treatment option across all risk profiles, the frequency of encountering patients with multivalvular disease will increase. Furthermore, percutaneous interventions to treat other valvular lesions are also evolving. Understanding the clinical implications and treatment options for a second valvular lesion is becoming increasingly important to guide heart team decisions, and this paper aims to review the evidence around these situations. Diagnosis of multivalvular disease can be challenging because of changes in physiology. There are little randomized data to guide therapy in multivalvular disease. Multidisciplinary heart team decisions can be invaluable in integrating the plethora of clinical, hemodynamic, and imaging data on which an optimal management strategy can be planned. Prospective studies to assess the role of structural valve interventions in the transcatheter aortic valve replacement era would greatly help improve outcomes for structural heart patients.  
Combined Transcatheter Tricuspid and Pulmonary Valve Replacement.  ;"BACKGROUND: For patients with combined tricuspid and pulmonary valve disease, operative intervention carries high mortality risk. Published reports of combined transcatheter tricuspid and pulmonary valve replacement have been limited to single cases. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed including all patients undergoing combined transcatheter tricuspid and pulmonary valve replacement at the Ahmanson/UCLA Adult Congenital Heart Disease Center. RESULTS: Combined transcatheter tricuspid and pulmonary valve replacement was undertaken in five adult patients (median age: 46 years; range: 24-64 years). Three had congenital heart disease and two had carcinoid syndrome. Four patients had previous surgical tricuspid valve replacement and one had a surgical incomplete annuloplasty ring. Four patients had previous surgical pulmonary valve replacement and one had a right ventricle-to-pulmonary artery homograft conduit. Two patients underwent Medtronic Melody valve implantation in both tricuspid and pulmonary positions and three underwent Edwards Sapien S3 implantation in both tricuspid and pulmonary positions. Valve implantation was successful in all. Follow-up ranged from 0.9 to 3.0 years. One patient underwent redo transcatheter tricuspid valve replacement 12 months after the first transcatheter intervention for progressive regurgitation of a Melody valve. This patient died 2.5 years after combined valve placement of complications from refractory heart failure. The remaining patients were alive and free of valve reintervention at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Combined transcatheter tricuspid and pulmonary valve replacement can be performed successfully, with an acceptable complication rate. This strategy is a feasible option for appropriately selected patients.  "
Surgical Valvuloplasty Versus Balloon Dilation for Congenital Aortic Stenosis in Pediatric Patients.  ;"BACKGROUND: For children with congenital aortic stenosis (AS) who are candidates for biventricular repair, valvuloplasty can be achieved by surgical aortic valvuloplasty (SAV) or by transcatheter balloon aortic dilation (BAD). We aimed to evaluate the longer term outcomes of SAV versus BAD at our institution. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the outcomes of 2 months to 18 years old patients who underwent SAV or BAD at our institution between January 1990 and July 2018. Baseline and follow-up characteristics were assessed by echocardiography. Long-term survival, freedom from reintervention, freedom from aortic valve replacement (AVR), and aortic regurgitation were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 212 patients met inclusion criteria (SAV = 123; BAD = 89). Age, sex, aortic insufficiency (AI), and aortic valve gradient were similar between the groups. At 10 years, 27.9% (19/68) of SAV patients and 58.3% (28/48) of BAD patients had moderate or worse AI (P = .001), and reintervention occurred in 39.2% (29/74) of SAV patients and 78.6% (44/56) of BAD patients (P < .001). Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed overall survival was 96.8% (119/123) for SAV and 95.5% (85/89) for SAV (P = .87). At 10 years, 35% (23/66) of SAV patients and 54% (23/43) of BAD patients underwent AVR (P = .213). CONCLUSIONS: Surgical aortic valvuloplasty demonstrated greater gradient reduction, less postoperative and long-term AI, and a lower reintervention rate at 10 years than BAD. There was no difference in survival or AVR reintervention rate. Surgical aortic valvuloplasty is a durable and efficacious intervention and should continue to be considered a favorable choice for palliation of valvular AS.  "
Invasive Hemodynamic Characteristics in Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Tricuspid Valve-In-Valve Implantation for Treatment of Tricuspid Stenosis.  ;BACKGROUND: We sought to describe invasive hemodynamic measurements in patients with tricuspid stenosis (TS) undergoing transcatheter tricuspid valve-in-valve (TVIV) implantation immediately pre- and postimplantation. Development of TS in patients who have undergone surgical tricuspid valve replacement with a bioprosthetic valve is a serious complication that leads to elevated right atrial (RA) pressures and decreased cardiac output. Transcatheter TVIV implantation is a viable alternative to surgical tricuspid valve replacement, but data on the hemodynamic consequences of TVIV for the treatment of severe TS are currently limited to echocardiographic assessment of Doppler-derived gradients. METHODS: Eleven patients undergoing transcatheter TVIV implantation with moderate to severe bioprosthetic valve stenosis were selected for retrospective review. Right atrial mean pressure, right ventricular (RV) systolic and end-diastolic pressure, mean diastolic RA-RV pressure gradient, pulmonary artery capillary wedge pressure, pulmonary artery systolic, end-diastolic and mean pressures, and pulmonary artery pulsatility index (PAPi) both before and after transcatheter valve placement were collected from catheterization reports. RESULTS: After transcatheter TVIV implantation, the mean TS gradient decreased significantly (P < .01), while the mean RV end-diastolic pressure increased (P = .046). Pulmonary artery pulsatility index also increased as the TS was relieved (P = .039). CONCLUSIONS: Tricuspid valve-in-valve implantation results in immediate relief of TS, leading to increased RV preload with resultant augmentation of RV and pulmonary pressures. Increased PAPi following the procedure demonstrates acute improvement in RV output but remains low due to the failure of the RA pressure to decline significantly immediately following intervention.  
Limiting factors of peak and submaximal exercise capacity in LVAD patients.  ;AIMS: Although patients supported with a Continuous-Flow Left Ventricular Assist Device (CF-LVAD) are hemodynamically stable, their exercise capacity is limited. Hence, the aim of this work was to investigate the underlying factors that lead to peak and submaximal exercise intolerance of CF-LVAD supported patients. METHODS: Seven months after CF-LVAD implantation, eighty three patients performed a maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test and a six minute walk test. Peak oxygen uptake and the distance walked were measured and expressed as a percentage of the predicted value (%VO2p and %6MWD, respectively). Preoperative conditions, echocardiography, laboratory results and pharmacological therapy data were collected and a correlation analysis against %VO2p and %6MWD was performed. RESULTS: CF-LVAD patients showed a relatively higher submaximal exercise capacity (%6MWD = 64±16%) compared to their peak exertion (%VO2p = 51±14%). The variables that correlated with %VO2p were CF-LVAD parameters, chronotropic response, opening of the aortic valve at rest, tricuspid insufficiency, NT-proBNP and the presence of a cardiac implantable electronic device. On the other hand, the variables that correlated with %6MWD were diabetes, creatinine, urea, ventilation efficiency and CF-LVAD pulsatility index. Additionally, both %6MWD and %VO2p were influenced by the CF-LVAD implantation timing, calculated from the occurrence of the cardiac disease. CONCLUSION: Overall, both %6MWD and %VO2p depend on the duration of heart failure prior to CF-LVAD implantation. %6MWD is primarily determined by parameters underlying the patient's general condition, while %VO2p mostly relies on the residual function and chronotropic response of the heart. Moreover, since %VO2p was relatively lower compared to %6MWD, we might infer that CF-LVAD can support submaximal exercise but is not sufficient during peak exertion. Hence concluding that the contribution of the ventricle is crucial in sustaining hemodynamics at peak exercise.  
Intramyocardial haematoma causing right ventricular outflow obstruction after brown snake (Pseudonaja species) envenomation in a dog.  ;A 15-month-old, male neutered Staffordshire Bull Terrier cross was presented to its referring veterinarian collapsed and agonal. He was immediately intubated, manually ventilated, and treatment commenced for presumptive snake envenomation with two vials of Tiger/Multi-Brown Snake Antivenom (minimum 7000 units/vial). The dog was transferred to a referral hospital intubated. Additional diagnostics performed following arrival at the referral hospital included a urine snake venom detection kit test, which was positive for brown snake immunotype. Three additional vials of Tiger/Multi-Brown Snake Antivenom (minimum 7000 units/vial) were administered until the dog was extubated and able to stand. Venom-induced consumptive coagulopathy (VICC) was diagnosed based on prolonged clotting times and scleral haemorrhage. Paroxysms of right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) origin ventricular arrhythmias were treated with lignocaine and sotalol. Four days after presentation, a new-grade IV/VI systolic heart murmur was auscultated, prompting an echocardiogram. An anechoic and compartmentalised mass measuring 43 mm × 19 mm was visualized within the right ventricular wall at the RVOT, immediately adjacent to the pulmonic valve. The mass was causing a RVOT obstruction. Its appearance was suggestive of an intramyocardial haematoma, most likely secondary to VICC. The dog remained cardiovascularly stable, and treatment consisted of supportive care. Recheck echocardiograms at 2 and 7 weeks after discharge revealed progressive improvement of the intramyocardial mass and resolution of the associated heart murmur. Although intramyocardial haematomas are rare, it should be considered as a differential in dogs that develop a newly diagnosed heart murmur and/or cardiac arrhythmia following brown snake envenomation.  
Clonal Hematopoiesis of Indeterminate Potential and Cardiovascular Disease.  ;PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review article is to summarize the preclinical and clinical evidence supporting the notion of clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP), highlight current knowledge gap, and provide future directions. RECENT FINDINGS: Epidemiological studies show that advanced age is a major risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer, the two leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. While the negative effect of aging on CVD is a reflection of cumulative exposure to various established traditional CVD risk factors, genetic sequencing of whole blood-derived DNA recently revealed that clonal mutations in myeloid stem cells are associated with higher risks of cardiovascular events and hematopoietic malignancies. The clinical repercussions of this biological state, termed CHIP, are increasingly appreciated. Historically, CHIP has been associated with an increased risk of hematological malignancies. However, new research is showing that CHIP is also associated with an increased risk of several cardiac-related conditions, including atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, aortic valve stenosis, and congestive heart failure. CHIP is increasingly being appreciated worldwide as a CVD risk factor, and further studies are needed to better understand the complex relationship between these two disorders.  
A study on the prevalence, distribution and related factors of heart valve calcification using coronary CT angiography.  ;BACKGROUND: The concept of active atherosclerotic disease has been accepted for heart valve calcification (HVC). We investigated prevalence, distribution and related factors of HVC in patients who had undergone coronary CT angiography (CCTA). METHODS: Subjects were consecutive 200 patients who underwent CCTA. The prevalence and the distribution of HVC using ECG gated non-contrast CT were investigated. Logistic regression analysis and simple regression analysis for factors associated with presence of the calcification and quantitative calcification in the aortic and mitral valve were conducted. RESULTS: HVC was detected in 48.0%. Aortic valve calcification (AVC) was found in 92 cases, the most, followed by mitral valve calcification (MVC) in 25 cases, pulmonary valve in 3 cases, and tricuspid valve in 1 case. Although the left coronary cusp showed the most in 65.2%, no statistic significant difference for Agatston score was detected among each cusp in AVC. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that age (OR:1.211, 95%C.I.:1.0716-1.1728, p < 0.0001) and coronary artery calcium score (CACS) grade (grade2 OR:7.3393, 95%C.I.:1.7699-30.4349, p = 0.0060, grade3 OR:7.2214, 95%C.I.:1.4376-36.2762, p = 0.0164) were significant factors associated with presence of AVC. The significant factors associated with quantitative AVC were age (p = 0.0043), dyslipidemia (p = 0.0117), and statin use (p = 0.0221). Only age (OR:1.1589, 95%C.I.:1.0726-1.2520, p = 0.0002) was significant factor related to presence of MVC. No significant related factor was found in quantitative MVC. CONCLUSIONS: There was an association between presence of AVC and CACS, but not a significant association with presence of MVC. Neither quantitative AVC nor MVC had a significant association with CACS or coronary artery disease.  
Partial Annuloplasty Rings in the Repair of Functional Ischemic Mitral Regurgitation.  ;Background Acute myocardial infarction (MI) is the leading cause of worldwide cardiac morbidities and mortalities. Mitral regurgitation (MR) is a common complication of MI. The severity of ischemic MR (IMR) can range widely, both clinically and hemodynamically. Mitral valve (MV) repair by lifting annuloplasty is a surgical procedure used to correct the pathology of IMR. The immediate outcomes of this technique have not yet been determined. The present study, therefore, evaluated the immediate results of MV annuloplasty performed to complement MV repair in patients with IMR. Methodology All adult patients with IMR who underwent lifting posterior mitral annuloplasty (LPMA) plus concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) were included. Immediate outcomes were evaluated by transesophageal color Doppler echocardiography. The frequency of successful outcomes was compared in patients with different baseline characteristics. Results Posterior mitral annuloplasty was successful in 93.1% of patients, including in 92.8% of men and 94.1% of women. The percentages of successful immediate outcomes differed significantly in patients with and without diabetes and hypertension, and in patients with two- and three-vessel disease. Conclusion LPMA resulted in a high percentage of successful immediate outcomes in patients with IMR. Further studies should compare rates of immediate, intermediate, and late outcomes of this technique.  
3D printing in adult cardiovascular surgery and interventions: a systematic review.  ;"3D printing in adult cardiac and vascular surgery has been evaluated over the last 10 years, and all of the available literature reports benefits from the use of 3D models. In the present study, we analyzed the current applications of 3D printing for adult cardiovascular disease treated with surgical or catheter-based interventions, including the clinical medical simulation of physiological or pathology conducted with 3D printing in this field. A search of PubMed and MEDLINE databases were supplemented by searching through bibliographies of key articles. Thereafter, data on demographic, clinical scenarios and application, imaging modality, purposes of using with 3D printing, outcomes and follow-up were extracted. A total of 43 articles were deemed eligible and included. 296 patients (mean age: 65.4±14.2 years; male, 58.2%) received 3D printing for cardiac and vascular surgery or conditions [percutaneous left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO), TAVR, mitral valve disease, aortic valve replacement, coronary artery abnormality, HOCM, aortic aneurysm and aortic dissection, Kommerell's diverticulum, primary cardiac tumor and ventricular aneurysm]. Eight papers reported the utility of 3D printing in the medical simulator and training fields. Most studies were conducted starting in 2014. Twenty-six was case report. The major scenario used with 3D printing technology was LAAO (50.3%) and followed by TAVR (17.6%). CT and echocardiography were two main imaging techniques that were used to generate 3D-printed heart models. All studies showed that 3D-printed models were helpful for preoperative planning, orientation, and medical teaching. The important finding is that 3D printing provides a unique patient-specific method to assess complex anatomy and is helpful for intraoperative orientation, decision-making, creating functional models, and teaching adult cardiac and vascular surgery, including catheter-based heart surgery.

Early failure of mitral valve repair with anterior leaflet pericardial patch augmentation in rheumatic and radiation-induced valvulitis.  ;DOI: 10.21037/jtd.2020.01.20 PMCID: PMC7330283 PMID: 32642211  
Tricuspid regurgitation and in-hospital outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve replacement in high-risk patients.  ;BACKGROUND: The prognostic impact of tricuspid regurgitation (TR) following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is uncertain, and the management of patients with severe aortic stenosis and significant TR undergoing TAVR is unclear. METHODS: Retrospective study investigating the role of TR severity on hospital outcomes in high risk patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing TAVR. RESULTS: A total of 174 participants were included in the present study. The median age was 84 years and 48% were women. The median (IR) STS score was 7.3 (4.7-13.6). The pre-procedural mean (SD) aortic valve area (AVA) was 0.69 (0.2) cm2 and the average (SD) peak and mean gradients were 71 [23]/42 [15] mmHg. Pre TAVR, 28.7% of patients had significant (moderate or severe) TR. Significant TR pre-TAVR increased the risk of in-hospital cardiovascular (CV) and all-cause and mortality [adjusted relative risk (RR) (95% CI): 14.67 (1.35-159.51) and 5.09 (1.14-22.72), respectively], and those with severe TR post-TAVR had longer hospital stay [median (IR): 9.9 (2.9-17.0) days]. No improvement or worsened TR (greater than mild) post-TAVR was associated with higher CV and all-cause mortality [adjusted RR (95% CI): 21.5 (1.81-255.96) and 8.19 (1.67-40.29), respectively]. Right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) was independently associated with TR severity pre and post TAVR. CONCLUSIONS: Significant TR was common among patients undergoing high risk TAVR, and is associated with increased in hospital mortality and longer hospital stay. Patients with elevated RVSP and persistent moderate or severe TR after TAVR are at higher risk of in hospital death.  
Transthoracic versus intra-operative transesophageal echocardiography in right heart assessment.  ;METHODS: Fifty-four patients who had combined mitral and tricuspid valve surgery were included. Right heart measurements were performed in the TTE apical 4-chamber (A4C) and RV inflow views, and TEE mid-esophageal 4-chamber (ME4C) and transgastric RV inflow views at end-diastole. Spearman correlation coefficients (r) were applied to test for associations between the imaging modalities. RESULTS: The mean age was 65 years and 39% were male. All patients had ≥ moderate tricuspid regurgitation (TR), and a secondary/functional etiology was present in 89%. The median TAd and RV basal (RVd) diameters in the TTE-A4C view measured 37 mm [interquartile range (IQR), 34-44] and 43 mm (IQR, 40-51), respectively. The TTE-A4C TAd strongly correlated with the TEE-ME4C measurement (r=0.72), with an overestimation of 1 mm (IQR, -2 to 4) by TEE (P<0.01). For RVd, the TTE-A4C measurement correlated moderately with the TEE-ME4C view (r=0.61), underestimating the RVd by -1 mm (IQR, -4 to 3.3) (P<0.01). No correlation was observed between TAPSE measured by TTE and TEE (r=0.22, P=0.13). CONCLUSIONS: Intra-operative TEE may reliably quantitate TA and RV size and geometry. The current findings are best interpreted as hypothesis-generating for future validative studies.  
The tricuspid valve in review: anatomy, pathophysiology and echocardiographic assessment with focus on functional tricuspid regurgitation.  ;"The tricuspid valve (TV) is a complex anatomical structure that incorporates a saddle-shaped annulus, asymmetric leaflets, the subvalvular apparatus and the right ventricle and its loading conditions. In this paper, an appreciation of the normal anatomy and physiology of the TV is reviewed before discussing functional tricuspid regurgitation (TR), a disease that has garnered renewed interest due to increased awareness of adverse outcomes and novel transcatheter therapeutic options. Two and three-dimensional echocardiographic imaging of the TV using transthoracic and transesophageal windows are subsequently discussed. The future of cardiovascular medicine will have more to offer the ""forgotten"" right-sided chambers and valves, and this review aims to refresh knowledge and enthusiasm around the forgotten but crucially important TV.

Mitral regurgitation: lessons learned from COAPT and MITRA-Fr.  ;"Recent studies about percutaneous treatment of secondary mitral regurgitation (MR) underlined the importance of left ventricular geometry and features of mitral valve as determinants of procedural and long-term success. Guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT), transcatheter mitral valve treatment (TMVT) and surgical procedures (mitral valve replacement, mitral valve repair at level of the annulus or subvalvular apparatus) have been extensively evaluated but not adequately compared in current clinical studies. A detailed analysis of the results of the study about transcatheter mitral valve repair would allow to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of such procedure and would provide potential indications for improving the quality of percutaneous and surgical repair in patients with moderate-to-severe secondary MR. Patients with proportionate MR (i.e., MR severity is proportional to the amount of left ventricular dilatation) are prone to respond to the optimization of medical therapy, while patients with disproportionate MR (i.e., MR severity is disproportionately higher than predicted by left ventricular dilatation, with high EROA and small left ventricle) are likely to benefit from additional repair. The identification of specific subpopulation of ""high responders"", based on the anatomic characteristics of the mitral valve and the relative dimensions of the annulus, the regurgitation and the left ventricle, can also apply to medical therapy. However, some pivotal component of MR (such as the symmetry of tethering and the differences in biomechanical features of leaflets) are not adequately investigated in current studies and warrant further evaluation.

Mitral regurgitation after transcatheter aortic valve replacement.  ;"Patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) might have an associated significant MR that can potentially lead to left ventricular (LV) failure after procedure. Considering the specific alterations in the mitral valve in TAVR scenario and the widespread use of TAVR in recent years, it appears important to know and understand the anatomical, functional and clinical implications to develop adequate strategies for the future. Patients with severe mitral regurgitation (MR) have been generally excluded from randomized clinical trials, making poor the impact that associated MR can have on clinical outcomes after TAVR. Several factors must be considered whose presence influences the severity of MR. For example, the elevated prevalence of coronary disease with consequent ischemic MR may account for LV dilation observed at the end stage of aortic stenosis. Evidence randomized studies and registries suggests that the rate of concomitant moderate-to-severe MR in patients undergoing TAVR oscillates between 2% and 33%, and patients with moderate to severe MR may have hemodynamic frailty with clinical deterioration during mechanical intervention. Short- and long-term outcomes, including cardiac mortality, appear to be influenced by the existence of preoperative moderate-to-severe MR or by the postprocedural worsening of mild MR, generally due to adverse LV remodeling. The incidence and the prognostic effect of concomitant MR in patients undergoing TAVR requires specific attention as might trigger adjunctive strategy treatment which should be carefully evaluated in clinical trials. KEYWORDS: Mitral regurgitation (MR); mitral valve; transcatheter aortic valve; transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).  "
Are the dynamic changes of the aortic root determinant for thrombosis or leaflet degeneration after transcatheter aortic valve replacement?  ;The role of the aortic root is to convert the accumulated elastic energy during systole into kinetic flow energy during diastole, in order to improve blood distribution in the coronary tree. Therefore, the sinuses of Valsalva of the aortic root are not predisposed to accept any bulky material, especially in case of uncrushed solid calcific agglomerates. This concept underlines the differences between surgical aortic valve replacement, in which decalcification is a main part of the procedure, and transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Cyclic changes in shape and size of the aortic root influence blood flow in the Valsalva sinuses. Recent papers have been investigating the dynamic changes of the aortic root and whether those differences might be correlated with clinical effects, and this paper aims to summarize part of this flourishing literature. Post-TAVR aortic root remodeling, dynamic flow and TAVR complications might have a fluidodynamic background, and clinically observed side effects such as thrombosis or leaflet degeneration should be further investigated in basic researches. Also, aortic root changes could impact valve type and size selection, affecting the decision of over-sizing or under-sizing in order to prevent valve embolization or coronary ostia obstruction.  
Structural heart disease: the year in valvular and complex coronary intervention trials.  ;The need for treatment strategies targeting complex structural heart and obstructive epicardial coronary artery disease (CAD) is rapidly growing. The demographics in referral centers has shifted to an older population with greater co-morbidities and higher risk. Indeed, nearly one quarter of patients in tertiary-care settings have moderate or severe valvular heart disease, and despite a decrease in overall CAD burden in the United States over the past two decades the prevalence of myocardial infarction remains high. The 2019 societal scientific sessions included novel research and landmark presentations on less invasive valvular and safer complex coronary interventions in the aforementioned populations, in hopes of improving patient outcomes and expanding treatment indications. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), percutaneous mitral and tricuspid valve therapy, and complex coronary interventions, were the focus of important clinical trials and registry data. Herein, we provide a select and concise review of the most pivotal studies presented.  
"[Minimally Invasive Mitral Valve Repair for Barlow's Disease;Stepwise Approach to the Complex Repair].  ";"BACKGROUNDS: Mitral regurgitation (MR) in Barlow's disease is complicated because of its mixed pathophysiology, leaflet billowing with/without organic prolapse, and abnormal annular dynamics that causes functional prolapse. Complex repair techniques, including aggressive leaflet resection and implantation of multiple neochords, are conventionally performed;nevertheless, these are technically demanding, especially when performed using a minimally invasive approach. We aimed to standardize the repair technique for Barlow's disease and developed stepwise repair techniques. METHODS: Of 209 patients who underwent isolated minimally invasive mitral valve repair for primary MR, 24 patients were found to have Barlow's disease. Their early and mid-term clinical outcomes were compared with those of the rest of patients( control group, n=185). Our repair technique for Barlow's disease consists of the following 3 steps:1) stabilization of the mitral annulus by placing annuloplasty ring sutures;2) distinction between organic and functional prolapse by a saline injection test;and 3) targeted repair for organic prolapse by leaflet resection or chordal replacement. RESULTS: Patients in the Barlow group were significantly younger than the control group (49±10 years versus 57±13 years, respectively). In terms of repair technique, leaflet resection or plication was performed in 70.8% and 74.6% of each group, while neochordal replacement was performed in 45.8% and 32.4%, respectively. One patient in the Barlow group underwent ring annuloplasty only. The annuloplasty ring size was larger in the Barlow group than the control group (34±2 mm versus 30±2 mm, respectively). Although the total procedure, cardiopulmonary bypass and cross-clamp times were significantly longer in the Barlow group than the control group, mechanical ventilation time, and duration of intensive care unit stay were similar between groups. The incidence rates of major postoperative complications were low in both groups. The freedom rates from moderate or greater MR at 3 years were 100% in the Barlow group and 87.7% in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: A stepwise repair strategy facilitates mitral valve repair in patients with Barlow's disease and provides excellent outcomes even via a minimally invasive approach.  "
"[Early Clinical Outcomes of Robotic Mitral Valve Repair;Initial Twenty Cases].  ";We report the early results of our initial 20 consecutive robotic-assisted mitral valve repairs at our institution. A total of 20 patients (aged 55±10 years, 15 males) underwent robotic assisted mitral repairs by using da Vinci system. Successful mitral valve repairs were done in all cases. All patients received an annuloplasty band. Triangular resection were done in 2 cases and artificial chordae were used in 18 cases. There was no conversion to sternotomy intraoperatively. Three cases needed recross-clamping because of mitral regurgitation, mitral stenosis and the problem of venous canula. Cardiopulmonary bypass time and aortic cross-clamp time were 272±56 minutes, 153±41 minutes. There were no hospital mortality and major complications. Post-pump echocardiograms showed no/trivial mitral regurgitation in all cases. Robotic-assisted mitral valve repairs were done safely and the early results were acceptable in our series.  
[Tips for Use of Chordal Guide System for Easy Adjustment of Appropriate Artificial Chordae Length in Patients Undergoing Minimally Invasive Mitral Valve Repair].  ;OBJECTIVES: In patients who require minimally invasive mitral valve repair (MICS-mitral), it is difficult to determine the appropriate length of artificial chordae, position, and number of artificial chordae. The Memo 3D Rechord, a complete prosthetic ring associated with a temporary chordal guide system comprised of yellow loops that function as a reference guide for automatically determining the height of neo-chordae. We sought to evaluate our tips for use of this system. METHODS: Five patients (1 male, mean 68 years old) who underwent MICS-mitral using artificial chordae with the Memo 3D Rechord were evaluated. Prior to surgery, we assessed the prolapse position using 3-dimensional( 3D) echocardiography to decide the number and positions of the artificial chordae. Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) sutures were passed through the papillary muscles and the free margin of the prolapsed leaflet, then appropriate positioning of the PTFE chordae was performed using a saline test. The PTFE chordae were passed through the loops and the free margin of the prolapsed leaflet was brought to the posterior annulus. Then, the PTFE sutures were tied and the temporary loop system removed. RESULTS: All patients had posterior leaflet prolapse. The number of the artificial chordae was 2 in 3 patients, and 1 in 2. The base of the artificial chordae was attached to the anterior papillary muscle in 3patients and posterior in 4. Additional indentation closure was required in 1 patient. All mitral valve repairs were performed successfully. Postoperative echocardiography mitral regurgitation( MR) grade was trivial in 5. CONCLUSIONS: Using our technique, it was possible to decide the appropriate length and position of the artificial chordae and MICS-mitral for leaflet prolapse with the Memo 3D Rechord is a simple and reproducible method.  
[Standadizing Right Minithoracotomy Valvular Surgery].  ;Minimally invasive cardiac surgery (MICS) via mini-right thoracotomy approach has been developed and standardized in the last 30 years, aiming to facilitate postoperative recovery and to minimize surgery-related complications. Mitral regurgitation is the major target of this MICS approach. In our institute, MICS mitral valve repair by direct vision under thoracoscopy guidance has been performed in 139 cases between 2011 and March 2018. Subsequently, robot-assisted surgery program was launched to perform mitral valve repair for 130 patients in the last 2 years. In-hospital and mid-term outcome post-mitral valve repair was not significantly different among sternotomy, MICS direct vision and MICS robot-assist approaches, though there were several pitfalls through the launch of the MICS program. Standardization of the MICS approach of mitral valve repair and other cardiac surgeries was herein summarized and associated pitfalls were explained from surgeons' view.  
"[Minimally Invasive Cardiac Surgery for Valvular Heart Disease in Japan;Past and Present].  ";Minimally invasive cardiac surgery (MICS) through partial sternotomy or parastenal incision was introduced for valvular heart disease in 1990s, it has gradually faded because it was somehow challenging without standardized manner or positive merits for the patients. Conversely, MICS via mini-thoracotomy has been started for mostly the patients undergoing mitral valve repair in 2000s, the number of MICS through mini-thoracotomy cases has increased progressively with the supports by academic societies and a national registry database system. Some enthusiasm for less invasiveness fashion oriented smaller skin incision and endoscopic procedures. Recently, robotically-assisted mitral valve surgery has taken place under strict regulation. Performing MICS requires not only surgeon's skills but also heart team strength including anesthesiologists and perfusionists. MICS should give cosmetic benefit and patient satisfaction, and credibility for cardiologists and society. Past and current status of MICS in Japan is described based on over 20-year author's experience from partial sternotomy MICS to robotically-assisted surgery for valvular heart disease.  
Update of Patient Selection and Therapeutic Strategy Using MitraClip.  ;"Patients with advanced heart failure often accompany severe function mitral regurgitation refractory to optimal medical therapy. Degenerative mitral regurgitation also develops due to various degeneration of mitral valve. Surgical intervention to the mitral valve might be effective in some cases, but it is challenging for the high-risk cases. Recently, percutaneous edge-to-edge mitral valve repair using the MitraClip system, which enables us to approach the mitral valve at relatively low risk, has developed. Two major prospective randomized control trials have been conducted to investigate the clinical advantage of MitraClip system over optimal medical therapy in patients with severe mitral regurgitation; both showed controversial conclusions. Now is a time to consider optimal patient selection and therapeutic strategy using MitraClip system.  "
A New TBX5 Loss-of-Function Mutation Contributes to Congenital Heart Defect and Atrioventricular Block.  ;"Congenital heart defect (CHD) represents the most common birth deformity, afflicting 1% of all births worldwide, and accounts for substantial morbidity and mortality. Increasing evidence highlights the pivotal roles of genetic etiologies in the pathogenesis of CHD, and pathogenic mutations in multiple genes, including TBX5 encoding a cardiac core transcription factor key to cardiovascular morphogenesis, have been involved in CHD. However, due to pronounced genetic heterogeneity of CHD, the genetic determinants underlying CHD in most cases remain obscure. In this investigation, by sequencing analysis of the coding exons and flanking introns of the TBX5 gene in 198 unrelated patients affected with CHD, a novel heterozygous mutation, NM_000192.3: c.692C>T; p. (Pro231Leu), was identified in an index patient with familial double outlet right ventricle (DORV), ventricular septal defect (VSD), and atrioventricular block (AVB). Genetic analysis of the proband's pedigree showed that the mutation co-segregated with the diseases. The missense mutation, which altered the amino acid conserved evolutionarily, was absent from 266 unrelated healthy subjects. Functional analyses with a dual-luciferase reporter assay system unveiled that the Pro231Leu-mutant TBX5 was associated with significantly reduced transcriptional activity on its target genes MYH6 and NPPA. Furthermore, the mutation disrupted the synergistic transactivation between TBX5 and NKX2-5 as well as GATA4, two other transcription factors causally linked to CHD. This study firstly links TBX5 loss-of-function mutation to familial DORV, VSD, and AVB, which provides novel insight into the mechanism underpinning CHD and AVB, suggesting potential implications for genetic evaluation and individualized treatment of patients affected by CHD and AVB.

Impact of beta blockers on patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement: the OCEAN-TAVI registry.  ;"OBJECTIVE: There is paucity of data on optimal medical treatment, including use of beta blockers for patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). The study aimed to investigate the association of beta blockers and clinical outcomes following TAVR. METHODS: We examined data of 2563 patients who underwent TAVR between October 2013 and May 2017 obtained from a prospective multicentre cohort registry, the optimised catheter valvular intervention-TAVI registry. We compared the 2-year cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular mortality and in-hospital outcomes between patients with and without preprocedural beta-blocker administration by propensity score matching (PSM). RESULTS: Preprocedural beta blockers were prescribed in 867 patients (33.8%). After PSM, the incidence of in-hospital congestive heart failure was significantly lower in patients with preprocedural beta blocker (p=0.046). No differences were found in 2-year cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular mortality. In the subgroup analyses, beta-blocker administration was associated with a lower cardiovascular mortality within 2 years in patients with a history of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG; log-rank p=0.017), presence of peripheral artery disease (PAD; log-rank p=0.003) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) ≥400 pg/mL (log-rank p=0.003). When stratified by postprocedural left ventricular ejection fraction (post-LVEF), beta-blocker administration was associated with a lower cardiovascular mortality among patients with post-LVEF <50% (log-rank p=0.024). CONCLUSIONS: Preprocedural beta-blocker administration was not associated with 2-year cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular mortality in overall, but was associated with a lower 2-year cardiovascular mortality in patients with a history of CABG, presence of PAD, BNP ≥400 pg/mL and post-LVEF <50%. The findings must be validated using randomised trials.  "
Acquired von Willebrand Syndrome Hiding Inherited von Willebrand Disease Can Explain Severe Bleeding in Patients With Aortic Stenosis.  ;OBJECTIVE: Aortic stenosis may be complicated by an acquired von Willebrand syndrome that rarely causes significant bleeding, raising the question of why it does so in a few cases. To seek an explanation, we studied 5 severe bleeder aortic stenosis patients in a cohort of 49 patients, using the flowchart for inherited von Willebrand disease. Approach and Results: All 5 patients were lacking in large and intermediate VWF (von Willebrand factor) multimers, 3 had reduced plasma and platelet VWF levels, and none showed PFA100 closure. Two patients (those with most multimers missing) also had a short VWF half-life. Genetic analyses on the 3 patients with reduced platelet VWF levels revealed that one carried both the c.1164C>G and the c.7880G>A mutations, and another carried the c.3390C>T mutation, while the third had one of the 2 VWF alleles relatively less expressed than the other (25% versus 75%). No genetic alterations emerged in the other 2 patients. Successful replacement of the stenotic aortic valve, performed in the 2 patients with VWF mutations, did not correct their abnormal VWF multimer picture-unlike what happened in the aortic stenosis patients without bleeding symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that acquired von Willebrand syndrome can develop in patients with hitherto-undiagnosed inherited von Willebrand disease. Since von Willebrand disease is the most common bleeding disorder, this possibility should be considered in aortic stenosis patients-especially those with a more severe bleeding history and more disrupted VWF laboratory patterns-because they risk hemorrhage during aortic valve replacement.

Surgical management of the aorta in BAV patients.  ;Patients with a bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) frequently develop aneurysms of the aortic root and tubular ascending aorta. Aneurysms of the aortic arch, in the absence of concomitant aortopathies, are much less common. According to the 2018 American Association of Thoracic Surgery consensus guidelines on BAV-related aortopathy, prophylactic surgical aortic repair / replacement is recommended starting at a maximum aortic diameter of 50 mm in patients with risk factors. Concomitant aortic surgery is also recommended at an aortic diameter of 45 mm in those patients with other indications for cardiac surgery (most commonly aortic valve procedures). The ultimate goal of prophylactic aortic surgery is the prevention of aortic catastrophes, e.g. aortic rupture or acute aortic dissection, which are associated with high morbidity and mortality. The surgical technique used - in elective and emergency cases - depends on the involvement and nature of the aortic valve disease, as well as the extent of aortic aneurysm formation. The current review focusses on the surgical management of the aortic root, tubular ascending aorta, and proximal aortic arch in BAV patients. Despite the abovementioned recommendations, many BAV patients develop acute aortic syndromes below the recommended aortic diameter thresholds. Further research is therefore required in order to identify high-risk BAV subgroups that would benefit from earlier surgical repair.

Association of Clonal Hematopoiesis of Indeterminate Potential With Inflammatory Gene Expression in Patients With Severe Degenerative Aortic Valve Stenosis or Chronic Postischemic Heart Failure.  ;"IMPORTANCE: Cytokine release syndrome is a complication of coronavirus disease 2019. Clinically, advanced age and cardiovascular comorbidities are the most important risk factors. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP), an age-associated condition with excess cardiovascular risk defined as the presence of an expanded, mutated somatic blood cell clone in persons without other hematological abnormalities, may be associated with an inflammatory gene expression sensitizing monocytes to aggravated immune responses. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This hypothesis-generating diagnostic study examined a cohort of patients with severe degenerative aortic valve stenosis or chronic postinfarction heart failure, as well as age-matched healthy control participants. Single-cell RNA sequencing and analyses of circulating peripheral monocytes was done between 2017 and 2019 to assess the transcriptome of circulating monocytes. EXPOSURES: Severe degenerative aortic valve stenosis or chronic postinfarction heart failure. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: CHIP-driver sequence variations in monocytes with a proinflammatory signature of genes involved in cytokine release syndrome. RESULTS: The study included 8 patients with severe degenerative aortic valve stenosis, 6 with chronic postinfarction heart failure, and 3 healthy control participants. Their mean age was 75.7 (range, 54-89) years, and 6 were women. Mean CHIP-driver gene variant allele frequency was 4.2% (range, 2.5%-6.9%) for DNMT3A and 14.3% (range, 2.6%-37.4%) for TET2. Participants with DNMT3A or TET2 CHIP-driver sequence variations displayed increased expression of interleukin 1β (no CHIP-driver sequence variations, 1.6217 normalized Unique Molecular Identifiers [nUMI]; DNMT3A, 5.3956 nUMI; P < .001; TET2, 10.8216 nUMI; P < .001), the interleukin 6 receptor (no CHIP-driver sequence variations, 0.5386 nUMI; DNMT3A, 0.9162 nUMI; P < .001;TET2, 0.5738 nUMI; P < .001), as well as the NLRP3 inflammasome complex (no CHIP-driver sequence variations, 0.4797 nUMI; DNMT3A, 0.9961 nUMI; P < .001; TET2, 1.2189 nUMI; P < .001), plus upregulation of CD163 (no CHIP-driver sequence variations, 0.5239 nUMI; DNMT3A, 1.4722 nUMI; P < .001; TET2, 1.0684 nUMI; P < .001), a cellular receptor capable of mediating infection, macrophage activation syndrome, and other genes involved in cytokine response syndrome. Gene ontology term analyses of regulated genes revealed that the most significantly upregulated genes encode for leukocyte-activation and interleukin-signaling pathways in monocytes of individuals with DNMT3A (myeloid leukocyte activation: log[Q value], -50.1986; log P value, -54.5177; regulation of cytokine production: log[Q value], -21.0264; log P value, -24.1993; signaling by interleukins: log[Q value], -18.0710: log P value, -21.1597) or TET2 CHIP-driver sequence variations (immune response: log[Q value], -36.3673; log P value, -40.6864; regulation of cytokine production: log[Q value], -13.1733; log P value, -16.3463; signaling by interleukins: log[Q value], -12.6547: log P value, -15.7977). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Monocytes of individuals who carry CHIP-driver sequence variations and have cardiovascular disease appear to be primed for excessive inflammatory responses. Further studies are warranted to address potential adverse outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 in patients with CHIP-driver sequence variations.  "

Abnormal ventricular contractile pattern associated with late systolic mitral prolapse: a two-dimensional speckle tracking study.  ;We sought to study the mechanics of ventricular contraction in patients with and outward basal movement. Using echocardiographic parasternal long-axis views we retrospectively screened 760 echocardiograms to enroll 50 individuals with late systolic bileaflet prolapse, papillary muscle traction, and outward movement of the sub-annular base and posterior mitral annulus in late systole. Two-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography was used to analyze the mechanics of contraction. Global and regional longitudinal strain values between the study group and 45 healthy control subjects were compared. The study group's global strain was lower compared to the control group. We identified a pattern of weak contraction of the inferior and lateral walls in the late systolic bileaflet prolapse group. The weakest segment in the study group was the basal-inferolateral segment (- 15.8% vs. - 21.5%, p < 0.001). There was no relationship between the mitral annular size, degree of leaflet prolapse, or degree of basal weakness. Late systolic bileaflet mitral prolapse and papillary muscle traction are accompanied by an outward movement of the sub-annular base and posterior mitral annulus in late systole. We demonstrated an abnormal contractile pattern in these ventricles characterized by a weaker contraction of the base, most significant at the inferolateral segment. This weakness of contraction may contribute to the outward movement of the base and posterior annulus.  
A rare disease of primary cardiac intimal sarcoma at the left atrium presented with mimicking mitral stenosis in a patient with polycystic kidney disease.  ;A 55-year-old woman presented with a history of constitutional symptoms with exertional dyspnea, orthopnea, and cough for one month. She developed progressive heart failure symptoms. Initial computed tomography revealed a large left atrial mass with compression of pulmonary veins and mitral valve. Surgical resection was performed, and histologic examination revealed an intimal sarcoma. The most effective treatment has been found to be a surgical resection, with chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The objective of this report is to describe a common presentation of a rare disease, and to discuss the significance of appropriate diagnosis, pathological findings, and timely interventional management. <Learning objective: Cardiac intimal sarcomas are rare primary malignant tumors. It requires a clinical suspicion for timely diagnosis and intervention, which could result in a good prognosis.>.

Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 activity, genetics and calcific aortic valve stenosis in humans.  ;BACKGROUND: Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) activity has been shown to predict calcific aortic valve stenosis (CAVS) outcomes. Our objective was to test the association between plasma Lp-PLA2 activity and genetically elevated Lp-PLA2 mass/activity with CAVS in humans. METHODS AND RESULTS: Lp-PLA2 activity was measured in 890 patients undergoing cardiac surgery, including 476 patients undergoing aortic valve replacement for CAVS and 414 control patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. After multivariable adjustment, Lp-PLA2 activity was positively associated with the presence of CAVS (OR=1.21 (95% CI 1.04 to 1.41) per SD increment). We selected four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at the PLA2G7 locus associated with either Lp-PLA2 mass or activity (rs7756935, rs1421368, rs1805017 and rs4498351). Genetic association studies were performed in eight cohorts: Quebec-CAVS (1009 cases/1017 controls), UK Biobank (1350 cases/349 043 controls), European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition-Norfolk (504 cases/20 307 controls), Genetic Epidemiology Research on Aging (3469 cases/51 723 controls), Malmö Diet and Cancer Study (682 cases/5963 controls) and three French cohorts (3123 cases/6532 controls), totalling 10 137 CAVS cases and 434 585 controls. A fixed-effect meta-analysis using the inverse-variance weighted method revealed that none of the four SNPs was associated with CAVS (OR=0.99 (95% CI 0.96 to 1.02, p=0.55) for rs7756935, 0.97 (95% CI 0.93 to 1.01, p=0.11) for rs1421368, 1.00 (95% CI 1.00 to 1.01, p=0.29) for rs1805017, and 1.00 (95% CI 0.97 to 1.04, p=0.87) for rs4498351). CONCLUSIONS: Higher Lp-PLA2 activity is significantly associated with the presence of CAVS and might represent a biomarker of CAVS in patients with heart disease. Results of our genetic association study suggest that Lp-PLA2 is however unlikely to represent a causal risk factor or therapeutic target for CAVS.  
Patibandla S(1), Kyaw H(2).  ;Double-chambered right ventricle (DCRV) was first described in 1858 by TB Peacock, but it is now understood to be a form of congenital heart disease wherein there is a mid-cavitary obstruction that dived the right ventricle into a high-pressure proximal portion and a low-pressure distal portion. DCRV can classify into two main types based on the tissue responsible for the mid-cavitary obstruction. Patients with type 1 DCRV have an anomalous muscle bundle that crosses the right ventricle while type 2 DCRV has parietal and septal muscle hypertrophy that is responsible for the obstruction, and they often are more likely to present with a ventricular septal defect (VSD). Associated anomalies include VSD (most common and can be seen in up to 90% of DCRV patients), transposition of the great arteries, tetralogy of Fallot, ruptured sinus of Valsalva aneurysm, atrial septal defect, aortic valve regurgitation, persistent left superior vena cava, tricuspid valve regurgitation, Ebstein anomaly, and valvar pulmonary stenosis.  
Fetal Cardiac Intervention for Pulmonary Atresia with Intact Ventricular Septum: International Fetal Cardiac Intervention Registry.  ;INTRODUCTION: Invasive fetal cardiac intervention (FCI) for pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum (PAIVS) and critical pulmonary stenosis (PS) has been performed with small single-institution series reporting technical and physiological success. We present the first multicenter experience. OBJECTIVES: Describe fetal and maternal characteristics of those being evaluated for FCI, including pregnancy/neonatal outcome data using the International Fetal Cardiac Intervention Registry (IFCIR). METHODS: We queried the IFCIR for PAIVS/PS cases evaluated from January 2001 to April 2018 and reviewed maternal/fetal characteristics, procedural details, pregnancy and neonatal outcomes. Data were analyzed using standard descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Of the 84 maternal/fetal dyads in the registry, 58 underwent pulmonary valvuloplasty at a median gestational age of 26.1 (21.9-31.0) weeks. Characteristics of fetuses undergoing FCI varied in terms of tricuspid valve (TV) size, TV regurgitation, and pulmonary valve patency. There were fetal complications in 55% of cases, including 7 deaths and 2 delayed fetal losses. Among those who underwent successful FCI, the absolute measurement of the TV increased by 0.32 (±0.17) mm/week from intervention to birth. Among 60 liveborn with known outcome, there was a higher percentage having a biventricular circulation following successful FCI (87 vs. 43%). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest a possible benefit to fetal therapy for PAIVS/PS, though rates of technically unsuccessful procedures and procedure-related complications, including fetal loss were substantial. FCI criteria are extremely variable, making direct comparison to nonintervention patients challenging and potentially biased. More uniform FCI criteria for fetuses with PAIVS/PS are needed to avoid unnecessary procedures, expose only fetuses most likely to sustain a benefit, and to enable comparisons to be made with nonintervention patients.  
Patterns of cardiovascular risk and disease in HIV-positive adults on anti-retroviral therapy in Mozambique.  ;"INTRODUCTION: With improved access to anti-retroviral therapy (ART) the focus of HIV treatment is changing to reducing chronic co-morbidities and their effects, but guidelines for HIV care in many African countries do not include screening for cardiac disease. Our study aimed to determine the pattern of cardiac abnormalities in HIV-positive patients on ART. METHODS: We implemented a prospective, observational study for 24 months on a random sample of adult patients seen at a dedicated HIV clinic in Mozambique. Demographic, clinical and full cardiovascular evaluations were performed on all participants. RESULTS: We enrolled 264 HIVvpositive patients (mean age 39.3 years; 186 female, 70.5%). The mean time on ART was 46 (SD 36) months and most had low viral load (174, 65%). Obesity (45, 17%), overweight (65, 24.6%), hypertension (54, 20.5%) and severe anaemia (21, 8.3%) were frequent. Diabetes was present in four patients (1.5%). The most important conditions in 252 patients submitted to echocardiography (88, 34.9% had cardiac abnormalities) were: severe rheumatic heart valve disease (six), severe dilated cardiomyopathy (five), aortic degenerative disease and congenital heart disease (in three patients each). At 24-month follow up, six of the 252 patients had died; of the 196 reviewed on echocardiography 29 had progressed and two had improved ventricular systolic function. CONCLUSION: This young cohort of HIV-positive patients on ART showed lower occurrence of tuberculous pericarditis and dilated cardiomyopathy but high cardiovascular risk, as assessed by the presence of obesity, hypertension and anaemia. Cardiac abnormalities needing multidisciplinary care were also found. There is a need for tailored cardiovascular risk stratification and screening for cardiovascular disease in HIV-positive patients on ART in Africa.  "
Defining the left ventricular base in mitral valve prolapse: impact on systolic function and regurgitation.  ;"In bileaflet mitral valve prolapse (BMVP) systolic leaflet displacement creates a pocket of blood on the left ventricular (LV) side of the leaflets, but on the atrial side of the annulus. This blood is excluded from the LV end-systolic volume if the mitral valve annulus is used to determine the most basal extent of the LV. The purpose of this study is to describe the quantitative implications of defining the LV base on mitral regurgitant severity and LV systolic function in BMVP. In 30 consecutive patients (53% male, 58 ± 14 years) with BMVP, LV endocardial and epicardial borders were determined from SSFP images. The LV base at end-systole was defined by the ""Functional"" method (at the mitral valve annulus) or the ""Anatomic"" method (at the mitral valve leaflets). Regurgitant volume was the difference between the LV stroke volume and mean forward flow. LV myocardial strain measurements were determined from the short axis endocardial and epicardial borders. The ""Functional"" method resulted in higher regurgitant volumes (mean difference: 22 ml, range 0-40 ml) and higher ejection fractions (mean difference: 9%, range 0-21%). The correlation between LV end-diastolic volume and regurgitant volume was better with the ""Functional"" method (r = 0.79, p < 0.0001) than the ""Anatomic"" method (r = 0.67, p < 0.0001). The correlation between global myocardial radial strain and LV EF was better with the ""Functional"" method (r = 0.86, p < 0.0001) than the ""Anatomic"" method (r = 0.68, p < 0.0001). In BMVP, the base of the LV should be defined at the level of the mitral valve annulus so that regurgitant volume most accurately reflects the functional significance of the mitral valve disease and LVEF most accurately reflects global systolic LV function. Defining the basal extent of the LV at the mitral valve leaflets leads to substantially lower regurgitant volumes and lower ejection fractions that could have important clinical consequences.  "

Strategies for diagnosis of fetal right atrium dilation: based on fetal cardiac anatomy and hemodynamics.  ;BACKGROUND: Fetal right atrium (RA) dilation is frequently detected in routine screenings while it remains a challenge to clarify the reasons. This study aimed to analyze the cardiac anatomy and hemodynamics of fetal RA dilation and the changes of hemodynamic indexes. METHODS: In the retrospective study, 420 fetuses with RA dilation were included, which were classified into the physiological group (n = 202), volume overload group (n = 142), and the pressure overload group (n = 76). The ratio of right atrium to left atrium (RA/LA) were measured at four-chamber view. Peak velocity of tricuspid regurgitation (VTR) was recorded in each case, if existed. RESULTS: The RA/LA ratio in the volume overload group is significantly higher than both the pressure overload group and the physiological group (both P = 0.000) throughout the pregnancy while no difference presents between the pressure overload group and the physiological group (P = 0.694 for 19-31 GW, and P = 0.974 for 32-36 GW, respectively). The VTR in the pressure overload group (3.29 ± 0.58 m/s) is significantly higher than both the volume overload group (1.85 ± 0.45 m/s, P = 0.000) and the physiological group (0.88 ± 0.45 m/s, P = 0.000). The volume overload group shows a significantly higher VTR than the physiological group (P = 0.000). In the volume overload group, the ductal contraction/closure shows a significantly higher VTR than that in the pulmonary valve stenosis/atresia (3.98 ± 0.41 m/s vs. 3.03 ± 0.38 m/s, P = 0.000). CONCLUSIONS: A strategy proposed herein is useful to clarify the reasons for RA dilatation by systematically assessing fetal hemodynamics, which may facilitate the sonographers to make an accurate diagnosis of congenital heart disease.  
Patibandla S(1), Heaton J(2), Azzam JS(3).  ;Aortic regurgitation (AR), also known as aortic insufficiency, is a form of valvular heart disease in which the integrity of the aortic valve is compromised and leads to inadequate closure of the valve leaflets. A normal aortic valve is comprised of three semilunar cusps that attach to the aortic wall. Loss of function occurs when the valves themselves become diseased or if there is aortic root involvement. In AR, there is retrograde blood flow from the aorta into the left ventricle which occurs in diastole in the cardiac cycle. Chronic AR was initially described by Corrigan in 1832 in syphillitic patients who suffered from aortic root dilation. The clinical presentation of AR depends on it's acuity of onset.

Recent advances in nonoperating room anesthesia for cardiac procedures.  ;"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The number of complex procedures performed in the cardiac catheterization laboratory (CCL) is rapidly increasing. Because of their complexity, they frequently require the assistance of an anesthesiologist. The CCL is primarily designed to facilitate a percutaneous cardiac intervention; therefore, it might be a challenging workplace for an anesthesiologist. The aim of this review is to briefly present tasks and challenges of providing anesthesia in the CCL and to provide a concise description of common cardiac procedures performed there. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent literature indicates that many complicated cardiac procedures can be performed in CCL under monitored anesthesia care. At the same time several of them (e.g. transcatheter aortic valve replacement) are quickly becoming a viable alternative for surgical valve replacement. The most recent expansion of CCL procedures is related to rapidly growing population of grown-ups with congenital heart disease. All aforementioned developments present new challenges to an anesthesiologist. SUMMARY: New and fast development of percutaneous cardiac interventions has created a new working place for the anesthesiologist - the CCL. Our expertise in complex cardiac pathophysiology allows conduct of complicated procedures outside of the operating theater. For the same reasons, there is ongoing discussion whether anesthesia support in CCL should be provided by a general or cardiac anesthesiologist.  "
Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in cardiogenic shock: TAVI-shock registry results.  ;OBJECTIVES: Aim of this study is to evaluate safety, feasibility, and mid-term outcome of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in cardiogenic shock (CS). BACKGROUND: Balloon aortic valvuloplasty in patients with severe aortic valve stenosis (SAS) complicated by CS is indicated but associated with a grim prognosis. TAVI might be a more reasonable treatment option in this setting but data are scant. METHODS: From March 2008 to February 2019, 51 patients with severe aortic valvulopathy (native SAS or degenerated aortic bioprosthesis) and CS treated by TAVI in 11 European centers were included in this multicenter registry. Demographic, clinical, and procedural data were collected, as well as clinical and echocardiographic follow-up. RESULTS: The mean age of our study population was 75.8 ± 13, 49% were women, and mean Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) score was 19 ± 15%. Device success was achieved in 94.1%, with a 5% incidence of moderate/severe paravalvular leak. The 30-day events were mortality 11.8%, stroke 2.0%, vascular complications 5.9%, and acute kidney injury 34%. Valve Academic Research Consortium-2 early safety endpoint was reached in 35.3% of cases. At 1-year of follow-up, the mortality rate was 25.7% and the readmission for congestive heart failure was 8.6%. CONCLUSIONS: TAVI seems to be a therapeutic option for patients with CS and SAS or degenerated aortic bioprosthesis in terms of both safety and efficacy at early and long-term follow-up.  
Hemolytic Anemia: Sneaky Cause, Leaky Valve.  ;"Intravascular hemolysis is a known complication of prosthetic heart valves. Severe hemolysis is rare (<1%) with the use of newer generation prosthetic valves. This usually occurs due to paravalvular leaks (PVLs). We present a case of hyperbilirubinemia and hemolytic anemia occurring as a result of a PVL of a prosthetic mechanical mitral valve. The patient was a 49-year-old female with a past medical history of rheumatic heart disease status following two mitral valve replacements each with a mechanical prosthesis; she presented with a complaint of worsening fatigue, epigastric pain, nausea, and vomiting. On examination, she had scleral icterus. Heart auscultation revealed a crisp mechanical S1 click and a soft 2/6 systolic murmur in the left lower sternal border. Her abdomen was soft with mild epigastric and right upper quadrant tenderness, and no Murphy's sign. Her labs revealed a white blood cell count of 7.0 x 103/microliter, hemoglobin 10.5 g/dL, hematocrit 29.7%, total bilirubin 6.9 mg/dL, direct bilirubin 0.8 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 62 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 79 U/L, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 56 U/L. An ultrasound of the abdomen revealed cholelithiasis without pericholecystic fluid collection and no ultrasonographic Murphy's sign. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography ruled out acute cholecystitis or intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation. A transesophageal echocardiogram showed a well-seated mitral valve prosthesis with a significant PVL and likely moderate mitral regurgitation. The patient was evaluated for possible hemolysis. Lactate dehydrogenase was 1155 U/L, haptoglobin was <30 mg/dL, and reticulocyte count was 5.2%. She underwent a mitral valve re-replacement with a mechanical prosthesis. An echocardiogram after the surgery showed the mechanical prosthesis mitral valve with no residual PVL.  "

Characteristics and Prognostic Associations of Echocardiographic Pulmonary Hypertension With Normal Left Ventricular Systolic Function in Patients ≥90 Years of Age.  ;"The high prevalence of pulmonary hypertension (PH) in elderly patients is well known. However, much remains unknown about those population. We sought to find the clinical characteristics of echocardiographic PH and the prognostic factors in patients ≥90 years of age. We retrospectively reviewed 310 patients ≥90 years of age (median age 92 years, 64% women) diagnosed as echocardiographic PH (peak systolic pulmonary arterial pressure ≥40 mm Hg) with normal left ventricular systolic function. We defined left heart disease (LHD) as significant left-sided valve diseases, left ventricular hypertrophy and left ventricular diastolic dysfunction by using echocardiography. The endpoint was all-cause death at 2,000 days after diagnosis. LHD was found in 92% of patients. During the median follow-up of 367 days (interquartile range, 39-1,028 days), 151 all-cause deaths (49%) occurred. Multivariable Cox regression analysis demonstrated that right ventricular fraction area change <35% (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]: 2.31; p <0.001), pericardial effusion (adjusted HR: 2.28; p <0.001), serum albumin <3.5 g/dL (adjusted HR: 1.76; p = 0.001), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (adjusted HR: 1.93; p = 0.001) and New York Heart Association (NYHA) class ≥II (adjusted HR: 1.73; p = 0.004) were associated with mortality after adjusted for age. In conclusion, LHD was significantly associated with echocardiographic PH in most patients ≥90 years of age. Also, the co-morbid factors at diagnosis (right ventricular systolic dysfunction, pericardial effusion, hypoalbuminemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and NYHA class ≥II) were independently associated with mortality.

A teenager with CHD and coronavirus disease 2019.  ;A 16-year-old girl with history of treated congenital mitral valve disease and signs of respiratory infection was admitted to our paediatric cardiology department. She was tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Despite her severe pre-existing cardiac conditions with pulmonary hypertension, atrial arrhythmias and mitral valve stenosis, the infection did not lead to any cardiac or pulmonary deterioration. In adults, cardiac co-morbidities are known risk factors for a severe course of coronavirus disease 2019 infections. This case illustrates that in children even severe cardiac disease is not necessarily associated with a severe course of coronavirus disease 2019.  
Futility Risk Model for Predicting Outcome After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.  ;Risk-benefit assessment for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is still a matter of debate. We aimed to identify patients with a bad outcome within 1 year after TAVI, and to develop a Futile TAVI Simple score (FTS). Based on the administrative hospital-discharge database, all consecutive patients treated with percutaneous TAVI in France between 2010 and 2018 were included. A prediction model was derived and validated for 1-year all-cause death after TAVI (considered as futility) by using split-sample validation: 20,443 patients were included in the analysis (mean age 83 ± 7 years). 7,039 deaths were recorded (yearly incidence rate 15.5%), among which 3,702 (53%) occurred in first year after TAVI procedure. In the derivation cohort (n = 10,221), the final logistic regression model included male sex, history of hospital stay with heart failure, history of pulmonary oedema, atrial fibrillation, previous stroke, vascular disease, renal disease, liver disease, pulmonary disease, anaemia, history of cancer, metastasis, depression and denutrition. The area under the curve (AUC) for the FTS was 0.674 (95%CI 0.660 to 0.687) in the derivation cohort and 0.651 (95%CI 0.637 to 0.665) in the validation cohort (n = 10,222). The Hosmer-Lemeshow test had a p-value of 0.87 suggesting an accurate calibration. The FTS score outperformed EuroSCORE II, Charlson comorbidity index and frailty index for identifying futility. Based on FTS score, 7% of these patients were categorized at high risk with a 1-year mortality at 43%. In conclusion, the FTS score, established from a large nationwide cohort of patients treated with TAVI, may provide a relevant tool for optimizing healthcare decision.  
Transcatheter Interventions in Adult Congenital Heart Disease.  ;This article provides a detailed review of the current practices and future directions of transcatheter interventions in adults with congenital heart disease. This includes indications for intervention, risks, and potential complications, as well as a review of available devices and their performance.  
Tetralogy of Fallot.  ;Repaired tetralogy of Fallot is one of the most common conditions managed by adult congenital heart disease providers. Recent comprehensive review articles and book chapters are devoted to this topic. The purpose of this article is to address several common clinical questions encountered in the management of patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot. These answers are not intended to supplant Practice Guidelines.  
Aortopathy in Congenital Heart Disease.  ;Aortic dilatation is common in patients with congenital heart disease and is seen in patients with bicuspid aortic valve and those with conotruncal congenital heart defects. It is important to identify patients with bicuspid aortic valve at high risk for aortic dissection. High-risk patients include those with the aortic root phenotype and those with syndromic or familial aortopathies including Marfan syndrome, Loeys-Dietz syndrome, and Turner syndrome. Aortic dilatation is common in patients with conotruncal congenital heart defects and rarely results in aortic dissection.  
Impact of Aortic Annulus Enlargement on the Outcomes of Aortic Valve Replacement: A Meta-analysis.  ;"We sought to evaluate the impact of surgical aortic annulus enlargement (ARE) on the perioperative outcomes of surgical aortic valve replacement. Databases were searched for articles published by October 2019 in order to carry out a systematic review followed by meta-analysis. Thirteen studies with 40,447 patients (aortic valve replacement [AVR] with aortic annulus enlargement [AAE]: 4686 patients; AVR without AAE: 35,761 patients) were included. The total rate of AAE was 11.6%, ranging from 4.1%-28.1%. The overall unadjusted odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval [CI]) for operative mortality showed a statistically significant difference between the groups, with higher risk in the ""AVR with AAE"" group (OR 1.388; 95% CI 1.049-1.836, P < 0.001), but not for isolated AVR+AAE (OR 1.341; 95% CI 0.920-1.956, P = 0.127) and also not in matched populations (OR 1.003; 95% CI 0.773-1.300, P = 0.984). The ""AVR with AAE"" group showed an overall lower risk of significant patient-prosthesis mismatch (PPM) (OR 0.567; 95% CI 0.376-0.854, P = 0.007) and a higher overall difference in means of indexed effective orifice area (iEOA) (random effect model: 0.058 cm2/m2; 95% CI 0.024-0.092, P < 0.001). The overall ORs for myocardial infarction, stroke, complete heart block/permanent pacemaker implantation and reoperation for bleeding showed no statistically significant difference between the groups. AAE is a useful adjunct to AVR, but the benefit of reduced PPM must be balanced against a possibly higher risk of perioperative mortality.  "
Spontaneous thrombosis of a transcatheter aortic valve replacement-induced aortic root pseudoaneurysm.  ;"Aortic annulus rupture or aortic root perforation is a rare complication of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), requiring emergent cardiac surgery and carrying a high intraoperative mortality. Few cases can be managed conservatively, provided a strict clinical follow-up. This study describes the case of a 78-year-old patient with a degenerated bicuspid aortic valve stenosis who presented with a late aortic root perforation following TAVR, which was successfully managed applying a ""watchful waiting"" approach. Cardiac computed tomography imaging played a pivotal role in the diagnosis and subsequent decision on treatment and clinical follow-up.  "
Potential impact of dynamic automated CT aortic annular measurements on outcomes for transcatheter aortic valve replacement sizing.  ;To determine the potential impact of automated computed tomography (CT) software used for aortic annular sizing for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) on paravalvular leak (PVL) and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) as compared to standard CT manual measurement. In 60 TAVR patients (84 ± 7 years, 60% male), we evaluated the preprocedural CT scans. For the standard manual measurement, we measured the perimeter and area from a single cardiac phase deemed to be of maximum systolic opening. Valve type and size were determined by a multidisciplinary TAVR team per clinical routine. From the dynamic automated software, we determined the aortic annular perimeter and area as the maximum value from an entire cardiac cycle. Valve size was readjudicated by a blinded interventional cardiologist who was provided with valve type and automated values. Clinical endpoints were adjudicated for presence of at least mild PVL and MACE at 30 days. There were 16 (28%) patients with PVL and 4 (7%) with 30-day MACE. When reclassifying valve size using dynamic automated values, 12 (20%) patients were undersized and 3 (5%) patients were oversized. Undersized patients were more likely to have mild-to-moderate PVL at 30 days (27% vs 4%, p = 0.04) than those not undersized. Of the 5 (45%) undersized patients with at least mild PVL, all were balloon-expandable valves. Automated dynamic CT annular measurements have the potential to reclassify patients with PVL with larger TAVR valve size, particularly balloon-expandable valves.  
Mechanisms of heart valve development and disease.  ;The valves of the heart are crucial for ensuring that blood flows in one direction from the heart, through the lungs and back to the rest of the body. Heart valve development is regulated by complex interactions between different cardiac cell types and is subject to blood flow-driven forces. Recent work has begun to elucidate the important roles of developmental pathways, valve cell heterogeneity and hemodynamics in determining the structure and function of developing valves. Furthermore, this work has revealed that many key genetic pathways involved in cardiac valve development are also implicated in diseased valves. Here, we review recent discoveries that have furthered our understanding of the molecular, cellular and mechanosensitive mechanisms of valve development, and highlight new insights into congenital and acquired valve disease.  
Lipoprotein (a) and risk for calcification of the coronary arteries, mitral valve, and thoracic aorta: The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis.  ;BACKGROUND: Lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] is a risk factor for coronary heart disease and calcific aortic valve disease. We determined the relationships of Lp(a) with prevalence and progression of coronary artery calcification (CAC), mitral annular calcification (MAC), and thoracic aortic calcification (TAC) in a multi-ethnic cohort of middle to older-aged adults. METHODS: This analysis included 6705 Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis participants. Lp(a) was measured with a turbidimetric immunoassay. CAC, MAC, and TAC were assessed by cardiac computed tomography both at baseline and once during follow-up. RESULTS: In adjusted relative risk regression cross-sectional analysis, a Lp(a) level ≥50 mg/dL was associated with a 22% higher prevalence of MAC (relative risk (RR) = 1.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00, 1.49). No significant associations were observed for prevalent CAC or TAC. In adjusted prospective analyses, participants with Lp(a) ≥50 mg/dL were at significantly higher risk for rapid CAC progression (median follow-up = 8.9 years), defined as ≥100 units/year, compared to those with lower Lp(a) levels (RR = 1.67, 95% CI = 1.23, 2.27). The association between higher Lp(a) levels and incident CHD was no longer significant after adjusting for CAC progression. No significant associations were observed for MAC or TAC progression (median follow-up = 2.6 years). CONCLUSIONS: Higher Lp(a) levels are associated with more rapid CAC progression. Additional study is needed to better understand how this relationship can further improve the ability of Lp(a) to enhance cardiovascular disease risk prediction.

Off-pump ascending aorta or aortic arch to descending aorta bypass with a pericardial roll for the treatment of critically ill infants with interrupted aortic arch.  ;AIM: Standard surgical treatment of the interrupted aortic arch with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass is risky especially in critically ill babies. In this manuscript, we present the results of off-pump pericardial roll bypass for the treatment of aortic interruption. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The technique was applied in nine critically ill infants between July 2011 and December 2019. Data were reviewed retrospectively. There were four girls and five boys. The types of the interruption were type B in six cases and type A in three babies. Additional cardiovascular anomalies were ventricular septal defect in all, atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale in all, single-ventricle pathologies in two and bicuspid aortic valve in three cases. All the patients were in critical situations such as intubated, having symptoms of infection, congestive heart failure or ischaemia and malperfusion leading visceral organ dysfunction. RESULTS: All patients underwent off-pump ascending aorta or aortic arch to descending aorta bypass with a pericardial roll. Post-operative early mortality occurred in one patient with severe mitral regurgitation due to cardio-septic shock. One patient who had single-ventricle pathology underwent bidirectional Glenn and was lost on the post-operative 26th day due to sepsis 2 years after operation. Two patients presented with dilatation of the pericardial tube 18 and 24 months after the operations and one underwent reconstruction of the neo-arch. The remaining patients are asymptomatic, active and within normal limits of body and mental growth. CONCLUSION: Treatment of interrupted aortic arch with a bypass with an autologous pericardial roll treated with gluteraldehyde without cardiopulmonary bypass seems a safe and reliable technique especially for the treatment of critically ill infants.  
Dilated cardiomyopathy mutations in thin-filament regulatory proteins reduce contractility, suppress systolic Ca(2+), and activate NFAT and Akt signaling.  ;Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is clinically characterized by dilated ventricular cavities and reduced ejection fraction, leading to heart failure and increased thromboembolic risk. Mutations in thin-filament regulatory proteins can cause DCM and have been shown in vitro to reduce contractility and myofilament Ca2+-affinity. In this work we have studied the functional consequences of mutations in cardiac troponin T (R131W), cardiac troponin I (K36Q) and α-tropomyosin (E40K) using adenovirally transduced isolated guinea pig left ventricular cardiomyocytes. We find significantly reduced fractional shortening with reduced systolic Ca2+. Contraction and Ca2+ reuptake times were slowed, which contrast with some findings in murine models of myofilament Ca2+ desensitization. We also observe increased sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ load and smaller fractional SR Ca2+ release. This corresponds to a reduction in SR Ca2+-ATPase activity and increase in sodium-calcium exchanger activity. We also observe dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), with concordant RAC-α-serine/threonine protein kinase (Akt) phosphorylation but no change to extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation in chronically paced cardiomyocytes expressing DCM mutations. These changes in Ca2+ handling and signaling are common to all three mutations, indicating an analogous pathway of disease pathogenesis in thin-filament sarcomeric DCM. Previous work has shown that changes to myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity caused by DCM mutations are qualitatively opposite from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) mutations in the same genes. However, we find several common pathways such as increased relaxation times and NFAT activation that are also hallmarks of HCM. This suggests more complex intracellular signaling underpinning DCM, driven by the primary mutation.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a frequently occurring cardiac disorder with a degree of genetic inheritance. We have found that DCM mutations in proteins that regulate the contractile machinery cause alterations to contraction, calcium-handling, and some new signaling pathways that provide stimuli for disease development. We have used guinea pig cells that recapitulate human calcium-handling and introduced the mutations using adenovirus gene transduction to look at the initial triggers of disease before remodeling.  
Percutaneous closure of an aortopulmonary window in a young adult patient: a case report of transcatheter closure with an occluder device.  ;BACKGROUND: Aortopulmonary window is a congenital heart disease requiring a surgical approach to achieve a complete correction. CASE SUMMARY: We report on a case of a young female symptomatic adult patient with a significant aortopulmonary window. The patients refused surgical approach and since the defect was far enough from the pulmonary and aortic valve a percutaneous approach was proposed. The large aortopulmonary window was closed effectively with an Amplatzer Muscular Septal Occluder device (Abbott, Plymouth, MN, USA). At 1-year follow-up, the device was in a good position with no residual shunt. DISCUSSION: Transcatheter closure of an aortopulmonary window is an effective and safe procedure in specific anatomic defects.  
Case report of successful low-dose, ultra-slow infusion thrombolysis of prosthetic mitral valve thrombosis in a high risk patient after redo-mitral valve replacement.  ;BACKGROUND: An increase in transvalvular pressure gradient of prosthetic valve should always raise suspicion for obstructive valve thrombosis. A multimodality diagnostic approach including transthoracic echocardiography, transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE), cinefluoroscopy, or computed tomography (CT) is necessary for a prompt diagnosis. The management of mechanical prosthetic valve thrombosis (PVT) is high risk in any therapeutic option taken. Emergency valve replacement is recommended for critically ill patients. Fibrinolysis is an alternative for patients with contraindication to surgery or if surgery is not immediately available. CASE SUMMARY: A 52-year-old woman presented with symptoms and signs of cardiac congestion. On laboratory, brain natriuretic peptide was elevated and international normalized ratio (INR) was in subtherapeutic range. She underwent a mitral valve replacement with mechanical prosthesis 7 months before, because of a significant residual regurgitation after repair on the same year. TOE revealed severe stenosis of the prosthesis with immobile anterior disc but there was no mass present. CT revealed a minor lesion at the hinge points of the prosthesis without involvement of the ring, suggestive for thrombus. The initial fruitless management with intravenous (i.v) heparin in high therapeutic range was followed by a successful 'low-dose, ultra-slow' fibrinolysis. DISCUSSION: CT may help differentiate thrombus vs. pannus. The acute onset of symptoms, inadequate anticoagulation, and restricted leaflet motion increased the suspicion for PVT. The current European guidelines propose normal dose fibrinolysis. We performed 'low-dose, ultra-slow' fibrinolysis due to lower bleeding risk with successful results. Low dose should be considered as alternative to normal dose fibrinolysis or urgent surgery.  
Contemporary Outcomes of Pulmonary Valve Endocarditis: A 16-Year Single Centre Experience.  ;"BACKGROUND: Limited data exist regarding the clinical characteristics and contemporary outcomes of patients with pulmonary valve (PoV) infective endocarditis (IE). METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of patients with a confirmed diagnosis of IE affecting the PoV at our centre between January 2002 and October 2018. Electronic medical records were reviewed to gather the clinical and echocardiographic variables. The population was subdivided according to risk factor profiles: group 1: miscellaneous risk factors; group 2: patients with congenital heart disease (CHD); and group 3: patients who inject drugs (PWID). The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. RESULTS: Out of 2,124 cases of IE during the study period, 24 (1.1%) patients had PoV IE. The majority of cases of PoV IE occurred in patients with prosthetic valves (54.2%). Coagulase-negative Staphylococci species were the most common micro-organisms. Seventy-five per cent (75%) of the patients required surgical management. The median follow-up was 2.8 years (interquartile range: 0.2-5.3 years). Patients with miscellaneous risk factors were older (p<0.01), and had higher rates of hypertension (p=0.01) and hyperlipidaemia (p=0.04). There was a statistically significant difference in survival between the groups (p=0.03), mainly driven by better outcomes of patients with CHD, compared to those with miscellaneous risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: In a contemporary 16-year series, a high proportion of patients with PoV IE required surgical management. Patients with PoV IE and CHD had better survival, compared to patients with miscellaneous risk factors at a median follow-up of 2.8 years.  "
Duration of Pre-Operative Antibiotic Treatment and Culture Results in Patients With Infective Endocarditis.  ;"BACKGROUND: Bacterial growth in cultures of resected heart valves of patients with infective endocarditis (IE) is influenced by pre-operative antibiotic treatment (preop-AT). OBJECTIVES: This study sought to evaluate the time dependency of valve culture results (positive valve culture [PVC] vs. negative valve culture) on preop-AT. METHODS: A total of 352 IE episodes in 344 adult patients of our tertiary referral hospital were retrospectively investigated (2005 to 2016). The primary endpoint was PVC results. The study used a logistic additive model adjusted for bacterial species, the McCabe-Jackson classification, and the existence of foreign valve material as covariables. RESULTS: The 231 included IE cases (187 [81%] men, median age 62 years, 153 [66%] native valves) comprised 58 (25%) PVC results and 173 (75%) negative valve culture results. A multivariable analysis adjusted for bacterial species, McCabe-Jackson classification, and valve type resulted in odds ratios for PVC of 6.35 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.94 to 20.78; p = 0.002) and 3.93 (95% CI: 1.57 to 9.84; p = 0.003) for Enterococcus spp. and Staphylococcus spp., respectively. Model-based odds ratios for PVC risk reduction in 2-day intervals of preop-AT ranged from 0.64 (95% CI: 0.61 to 0.68) at day 7 to 0.74 (95% CI: 0.70 to 0.78) at day 13 and 0.98 (95% CI: 0.93 to 1.02) at day 21. CONCLUSIONS: In IE cases treated with valve surgery, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus spp. were associated with valve culture growth. After 7 days of antibiotic treatment, the additional effect of preop-AT on valve culture results per 2-day interval was minor. Antibiotic treatment beyond 21 days had no influence on culture results.  "
Subclinical Hypothyroidism Affects the Long-Term Outcomes of Patients Who Undergo Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting Surgery but Not Heart Valve Surgery.  ;"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to determine the associations between subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) and long-term cardiovascular outcomes after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or heart valve surgery (HVS). METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed and compared all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and cardiovascular events in 461 patients who underwent CABG and 104 patients who underwent HVS. RESULTS: During a mean±standard deviation follow-up duration of 7.6±3.8 years, there were 187 all-cause deaths, 97 cardiovascular deaths, 127 major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), 11 myocardial infarctions, one unstable angina, 70 strokes, 30 hospitalizations due to heart failure, 101 atrial fibrillation, and 33 coronary revascularizations. The incidence of all-cause mortality after CABG was significantly higher in patients with SCH (n=36, 55.4%) than in euthyroid patients (n=120, 30.3%), with a hazard ratio of 1.70 (95% confidence interval, 1.10 to 2.63; P=0.018) after adjustment for age, sex, current smoking status, body mass index, underlying diseases, left ventricular dysfunction, and emergency operation. Interestingly, low total triiodothyronine (T3) levels in euthyroid patients who underwent CABG were significantly associated with increased risks of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and MACE, but those associations were not observed in HVS patients. Both free thyroxine and thyroid-stimulating hormone levels in euthyroid patients were not related with any cardiovascular outcomes in either the CABG or HVS group. CONCLUSION: SCH or low total T3 might be associated with a poor prognosis after CABG, but not after HVS, implying that preoperative thyroid hormonal status may be important in ischemic heart disease patients.

A case of COVID-19 in a patient with a univentricular heart post total cavopulmonary connection (Fontan) surgery.  ;"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a global pandemic which has affected patients and healthcare systems around the world. Patients with underlying health conditions seem to be more severely affected. There are limited reports of patients with univentricular circulations and COVID 19; thus, we report a case of COVID-19 in a patient with a univentricular circulation.  "
Left Atrial Posterior Wall Thrombus After Posterior Wall Ablation.  ;Background: Posterior wall isolation for recurrent atrial arrhythmia is a commonly used technique to achieve long-term freedom from atrial fibrillation. Despite the widespread use of posterior wall isolation, its long-term effects on left atrial function are unknown. Specifically, the effect of isolated atrial walls on stasis and risk of thrombus has not been established. We present the case of a patient who developed a left atrial posterior wall thrombus after a posterior wall isolation attempt. Case Report: A 67-year-old female with a complex electrophysiologic history was found to have a left atrial posterior wall thrombus when she presented for a third ablation attempt for drug-refractory macroreentrant left atrial tachycardia 5 weeks after a posterior wall isolation attempt. The patient had a number of risk factors that could have been associated with the unusually located thrombus: hypertension, low ejection fraction, mitral valve disease, and recurrence and sustained duration of symptomatic atrial fibrillation. After the patient had 3 weeks of anticoagulation treatment, transesophageal echocardiography showed no left atrial thrombus, and she underwent successful reisolation of the posterior wall. The third ablation was successful, and the patient developed no complications of stroke, transient ischemic attack, or systemic embolization throughout her treatment course. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this case is the second report of a left atrial posterior wall thrombus in this setting. The patient's complex and specific set of risk factors likely led to this rare finding. Although left atrial posterior wall thrombus after ablation is rare, in patients with specific risks or a combination of factors that could lead to such a clot, visualizing the left atrium in these patients may be beneficial to minimize the risk of systemic embolization.  
Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement for Aortic Stenosis in Dialysis Patients　- Analysis of Japan Cardiovascular Surgery Database.  ;BACKGROUND: Perioperative risk during surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) is reportedly high in dialysis patients. We aimed to determine the postoperative mortality and morbidity and identify the perioperative risk factors of mortality during SAVR in dialysis-dependent patients.Methods and Results:From the Japan Adult Cardiovascular Surgery Database, we compared 2,875 dialysis-dependent patients with 18,839 non-dialysis patients who all underwent SAVR between January 2013 and December 2016. The operative mortality was 8.7% vs. 2.0% in the dialysis and non-dialysis groups, respectively. Multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis for operative mortality revealed 8 independent risk factors including age (odds ratio [OR]=1.2), concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting (OR=1.5), peripheral arterial disease (OR=1.9), atrial fibrillation (OR=2.5), New York Heart Association class IV (OR=2.5), liver dysfunction (OR=5.8), reduced left ventricular function (OR=1.4), and history of previous cardiac surgery (OR=2.1). In addition, 8 postoperative predictors of operative mortality were identified including bleeding deep sternal infection (OR=3.4), prolonged ventilation (OR=5.4) and gastrointestinal complications (OR=10.3). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with non-dialysis patients, SAVR in dialysis patients was associated with high rates of mortality and morbidity. An appropriate surgical strategy and careful perioperative assessment and management for prevention of infection, and respiratory and gastrointestinal complications might contribute to improved clinical outcomes after SAVR in these patients.  
Atrial functional mitral regurgitation: mechanisms and surgical implications.  ;The term atrial functional mitral regurgitation refers to a newly recognized disease entity in which mitral regurgitation occurs secondary to left atrial disease, without left ventricular dilatation and intrinsic mitral valve disease, typically in the setting of long-standing atrial fibrillation. Recent evidence suggests that atrial functional mitral regurgitation is associated with increased risk of death and heart failure re-hospitalization. The etiology, pathophysiology, and mechanism of atrial functional mitral regurgitation is not completely understood but they should not be regarded as the same as for the conventional type of functional mitral regurgitation secondary to left ventricular dilatation and dysfunction. Mitral annular dilatation, atriogenic leaflet distortion, insufficient leaflet remodeling, and subtle left ventricular dysfunction may play a role in the pathogenesis of atrial functional mitral regurgitation. The therapeutic and surgical considerations of atrial functional mitral regurgitation are different from those of ventricular functional mitral regurgitation. In this review, we assess current evidence regarding this new disease entity and propose a new surgical approach based on up-to-date understanding and experience of this condition.  
Reversible Cardiovocal (Ortner's) Syndrome in Dilated Cardiomyopathy - A Rare Presentation of a Common Disease.  ;Ortners syndrome is a rare cause of recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy due to cardiac causes. After the description of this syndrome by Ortner in patients with mitral stenosis, it was described by many authors in multiple other cardiac conditions. Here we present a case of Ortner's syndrome in Dilated cardiomyopathy,which reverted completely after medical management of DCMP.  
Bioprosthetic Valve Fracture for Early Severe Prosthesis Mismatch After SAVR.  ;"BACKGROUND: Patient prosthesis mismatch (PPM) is an iatrogenic complication that occurs in patients who undergo surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). PPM occurs when the implanted surgical valve has an effective orifice area (EOA) that is too small for the patient, resulting in a gradient across the valve despite an otherwise normally functioning prosthesis. PPM has been associated with mid- and long-term increased morbidity and mortality. When this occurs, repeat SAVR with root enlargement and implantation of a larger prosthesis is traditionally employed; however, this approach involves the risks of morbidity and mortality of redo surgery, which may be prohibitive in critically ill or medically complex patients. Bioprosthetic valve fracture (BVF), where high-pressure balloon inflation is employed to fracture the surgical valve sewing ring to increase the EOA, has been used as an adjunct for valve-in-valve (transcatheter aortic valve in surgical aortic valve [TAV in SAV]) procedures for degenerated surgical valves to increase EOA, but has not yet been reported as standalone therapy for early PPM after SAVR. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case of a 41-year-old male (body surface area, 2.3 m²) who presented 4 months after SAVR with a 21 mm surgical valve (Magna Ease, true inner diameter, 19 mm) with severe PPM (mean gradient, 43 mm Hg) despite normal functioning valvular prosthetic leaflets, associated with debilitating symptoms. This patient was deemed high risk by the heart team, and was successfully treated with TAV in SAV (26 mm Evolut R) and concomitant high-pressure bioprosthetic valve fracture (BVF) with a 22 mm high-pressure balloon. The patient tolerated the procedure well; mean gradient was 5 mm Hg post BVF and prompt resolution of symptoms was seen. His postprocedure recovery was uneventful and his symptoms resolved, allowing him to return to work within a week of his hospital discharge. BVF associated with TAV in SAV appears to be a feasible approach for treatment of severe symptomatic PPM even in the early postoperative period with otherwise normally functioning prosthesis.  "
Outcomes and predictors of cardiac events in medically treated patients with atrial functional mitral regurgitation.  ;BACKGROUND: Little is known about the outcomes and predictors of adverse cardiac events in medically treated patients with atrial functional mitral regurgitation (FMR). METHODS: We screened 1405 consecutive patients with grade ≥ 3+ mitral regurgitation (MR) detected by echocardiography. After excluding patients with previous or early (within 3 months from diagnosis) mitral valve surgery, congenital heart disease, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, severe aortic valve disease, or unknown etiology, the study population consisted of 319 patients with primary MR, 395 patients with FMR with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, and 184 patients with atrial FMR. Atrial FMR was defined as FMR in patients without LV wall motion abnormality or dilatation. RESULTS: The cumulative incidence of the composite of cardiac death and heart failure hospitalization at 3 years was 10.5% in primary MR, 37.5% in FMR with LV dysfunction, and 14.0% in atrial FMR (p < .001). In atrial FMR patients, LV end-diastolic volume index (hazard ratio [HR] 1.06, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-1.10), severe MR (grade 4+) (HR 2.73, 95% CI 1.21-6.12), being symptomatic (NYHA ≥ 2) (HR 2.82, 95% CI 1.15-6.92), and having ≥1 comorbidities (HR 3.96, 95% CI 1.74-9.00) were independently associated with an increased risk for adverse cardiac events by a multivariable Cox regression analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Outcomes of medically treated patients with atrial FMR were better than those of FMR with LV dysfunction, but worse than those of primary MR. In atrial FMR patients, LV dilatation, severe MR, being symptomatic, and the presence of comorbidities were independently associated with an increased risk for adverse cardiac events.

Feasibility and safety of a fully percutaneous transcatheter aortic valve replacement program.  ;"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the feasibility and safety of conducting an entire transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) program by using percutaneous techniques only. BACKGROUND: Surgically assisted transthoracic TAVR has been reported to be associated with more complications and longer hospital stays. METHODS: During 2019, all TAVR at a single center were performed by standard transfemoral (TF), intravascular lithotripsy-assisted TF, transaxillary (TAx), or transcaval approach using percutaneous techniques only. No patients were denied TAVR because of access. Procedural and clinical endpoints were categorized using Valve Academic Research Consortium-2 criteria. RESULTS: In total, 306 consecutive TAVR patients were enrolled (mean age 78.9 ± 7.2 years). Most patients were treated by TF approach (94.8%)-of these, nine (2.9%) were pre-treated with intravascular lithotripsy. A percutaneous TAx and transcaval approach were used in 12 (3.9%) and four patients (1.3%), respectively. There were no procedural deaths and one peri-procedural stroke. Valve performance was satisfying in 298 patients (97.4%); six patients had a moderate aortic regurgitation and two patients had a mean gradient ≥20 mmHg following valve-in-valve procedure. The 30-day major vascular complication and major bleeding rate was 2.3% and 3.9%, respectively. A new permanent pacemaker was implanted in 41 patients (13.4%). Of all patients, 81% were discharged within two days post-TAVR, including 11 out of 12 TAx patients and all transcaval cases. CONCLUSIONS: A fully percutaneous TAVR program is feasible and safe with favorable immediate and early clinical outcomes and allowing a short hospital stay.  "

Cardiac Mast Cells: Underappreciated Immune Cells in Cardiovascular Homeostasis and Disease.  ;Mast cells are multifarious immune cells with complex roles in tissue homeostasis and disease. They produce a plethora of mediators that play roles in inflammation, angiogenesis, lymphangiogenesis, and tissue remodeling. Recent insights into the heterogeneity of cardiac mast cell (CMC) subpopulations have renewed interest in their functional diversity in homeostasis and disease. They are located within the human heart in the myocardium, in atherosclerotic plaques, in the aortic valve, and in close proximity to nerves. Their plasticity enables different and even opposite functions in response to changing tissue contexts. These characteristics render CMCs intriguing, with a dichotomous role in protecting against, or accelerating, cardiovascular diseases. Future work should aim to identify CMC subsets, which could reveal novel therapeutic opportunities for cardiovascular disorders.  
Pocket-sized echocardiography for screening structural heart disease: diagnostic accuracy and cost-effectiveness for population-based studies.  ;BACKGROUND: The standard transthoracic echocardiography has some limitations in emergent and community-based situations. The emergence of pocket-sized ultrasound has led to influential advancements. METHODS: In this prospective study, in the hospital-based phase, children with suspected structural heart diseases were enrolled. In the school-based phase, healthy children were randomly selected from six schools. All individuals were examined by experienced operators using both the standard and the pocket-sized echocardiography. RESULTS: A total of 73 individuals with a mean age of 9.9 ± 3.2 years in the hospital-based cohort and 143 individuals with a mean age of 12.8 ± 2.9 years in the school-based cohort were examined. The agreements between the standard and the pocket-sized echocardiography were good or excellent for major CHDs in both cohorts (κ statistics > 0.61). Among valvular pathologies, agreements for tricuspid and pulmonary valves' regurgitation were moderate among school-based cohorts (0.56 [95% confidence interval 0.12-1] and 0.6 [95% confidence interval 0.28-0.91], respectively). The agreements for tricuspid and pulmonary valves' regurgitation were excellent (>0.9) among hospital-based population. Other values for valvular findings were good or excellent. The overall sensitivity and specificity were 87.5% (95% confidence interval 47.3-99.7) and 93.8% (95% confidence interval 85-98.3) among the hospital-based individuals, respectively, and those were 88% (95% confidence interval 77.8-94.7) and 68.4% (95% confidence interval 56.7-78.6) among the school-based individuals, respectively. The cost of examination was reduced by approximately 70% for an individual using the pocket-sized device. CONCLUSIONS: When interpreted by experienced operators, the pocket-sized echocardiography can be used as screening tool among school-aged population.  
Substantially Altered Expression Profile of Diabetes/Cardiovascular/Cerebrovascular Disease Associated microRNAs in Children Descending from Pregnancy Complicated by Gestational Diabetes Mellitus-One of Several Possible Reasons for an Increased Cardiovascular Risk.  ;Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), one of the major pregnancy-related complications, characterized as a transitory form of diabetes induced by insulin resistance accompanied by a low/absent pancreatic beta-cell compensatory adaptation to the increased insulin demand, causes the acute, long-term, and transgenerational health complications. The aim of the study was to assess if alterations in gene expression of microRNAs associated with diabetes/cardiovascular/cerebrovascular diseases are present in whole peripheral blood of children aged 3-11 years descending from GDM complicated pregnancies. A substantially altered microRNA expression profile was found in children descending from GDM complicated pregnancies. Almost all microRNAs with the exception of miR-92a-3p, miR-155-5p, and miR-210-3p were upregulated. The microRNA expression profile also differed between children after normal and GDM complicated pregnancies in relation to the presence of overweight/obesity, prehypertension/hypertension, and/or valve problems and heart defects. Always, screening based on the combination of microRNAs was superior over using individual microRNAs, since at 10.0% false positive rate it was able to identify a large proportion of children with an aberrant microRNA expression profile (88.14% regardless of clinical findings, 75.41% with normal clinical findings, and 96.49% with abnormal clinical findings). In addition, the higher incidence of valve problems and heart defects was found in children with a prior exposure to GDM. The extensive file of predicted targets of all microRNAs aberrantly expressed in children descending from GDM complicated pregnancies indicates that a large group of these genes is involved in ontologies of diabetes/cardiovascular/cerebrovascular diseases. In general, children with a prior exposure to GDM are at higher risk of later development of diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular/cerebrovascular diseases, and would benefit from dispensarisation as well as implementation of primary prevention strategies.  
The Congenital Bicuspid Aortic Valve Condition in 2020.  ;DOI: 10.1016/j.pcad.2020.06.010 PMID: 32603754 [Indexed for MEDLINE]  
Histologic Abnormalities of the Ascending Aorta: Effects on Aortic Remodeling after Intracardiac Repair of Tetralogy of Fallot.  ;"We evaluated aortic tissue specimens from patients undergoing tetralogy of Fallot repair, to determine whether histologic abnormalities affect postsurgical aortic remodeling and other patient-related variables. Using light microscopy, we studied full-thickness aortic wall tissue operatively excised from 118 consecutive patients undergoing intracardiac repair of tetralogy of Fallot. We performed multiple linear regression analysis to identify independent predictors of change in aortic root dimensions, which we measured with echocardiography after repair and every 3 months thereafter. Thirty histologically normal specimens were used as controls. Elastic fiber fragmentation was found in 74.6% of the abnormal specimens, mucoid extracellular matrix accumulation in 49.2%, smooth muscle cell nuclei loss in 39%, smooth muscle cell disorganization in 28.8%, and medial fibrosis in 52.5%. At a mean follow-up time of 83.55 ± 42.08 months, mean aortic sinotubular diameter decreased from 28.79 ± 9.15 to 27.16 ± 8.52 mm/m2 (r =-0.43; P <0.001). Aortic sinotubular diameter decreased by 0.6 mm/m2 among females (β =0.6, SE=0.31; P =0.05) and by 0.88 mm/m2 in patients who had elastic fiber fragmentation or loss (β =0.88, SE=0.38; P =0.02). In bivariate and multiple linear regression analysis, duration of follow-up emerged as an independent predictor of aortic remodeling. The aortic histopathologic changes in our patients had an independent negative impact on the degree of aortic remodeling after surgery. We observed the most improved aortic sinotubular diameter in patients who had either histologically normal aortas or aortas with elastic fragmentation.  "
Single-access during Impella hemodynamic support utilizing the Railway system.  ;A single-access technique during mechanical circulatory support (MCS) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has been described for those patients where an additional arterial access site is not available or desired. This technique utilizes the Impella (Abiomed, Danvers, MA) 14 French (F) sheath as a single-access point, with a 7 F sheath through the 14 F sheath hemostatic valve next to the Impella catheter (Abiomed). However, this technique is limited to a 7 F sheath or smaller and can be difficult requiring multiple attempts and limit guide catheter manipulation. We describe a single-access technique utilizing the Impella (Abiomed) 14 F sheath and a standard 7 F guide catheter placed sheathless through the 14 F sheath hemostatic valve utilizing the Railway Sheathless Access System (Cortis, Santa Clara, CA).  
Assessment of left ventricular systolic function in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients with myocardial injury: a study based on layer-specific speckle tracking echocardiaography.  ;We conducted this study to investigate left ventricle (LV) systolic function in endocardial, mid-myocardial, and epicardial layers by two-dimensional (2D) speckle tracking echocardiography (STE) in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) patients with myocardial injury indexed by elevated serum cardiac troponin I (cTnI). Twenty-nine HCM patients with myocardial injury, thirty-five HCM patients without myocardial injury, and ninty-one healthy controls were enrolled in this study. Serum cTnI > 0.026 ng/mL was defined as myocardial injury. LV longitudinal and circumferential strain (LS and CS) were assessed in endocardial, mid-myocardial and epicardial layers. Layer-specific LS and CS differed significantly (all P < 0.001) among all three groups in all three layers, in a descending order from healthy controls to HCM patients without myocardial injury to HCM patients with myocardial injury. Layer-specific LS and CS were decreased the most in HCM patients with myocardial injury indexed by elevated seum cTnI (all P < 0.05). In HCM patients with myocardial injury, layer-specific LS and CS were significantly lower in the segments with greater hypertrophy (segmental thickness ≥ 15 mm) (all P < 0.001) except for endocardial CS (P > 0.05). Layer-specific evaluation of LV strain may improve understanding of impaired LV systolic function in HCM patients with myocardial injury, thus preventing further damage.  
Mitral valve regurgitation: a disease with a wide spectrum of therapeutic options.  ;Over the past two decades interest in mitral valve regurgitation has increased as a result of the development of new technologies that have expanded the number of patients who can potentially benefit from mitral regurgitation treatments. To develop new devices for the treatment of mitral regurgitation, the focus has been placed on the functional anatomy and pathophysiology of the mitral valve, with the use of the most advanced methods of cardiac imaging that allow the best visualization of the mitral valve and a perfect understanding of the complexity of a specific disease. Mitral regurgitation is still underdiagnosed and undertreated in a substantial number of patients who have poor survival. Therefore, the priority should be to identify and treat these patients to increase their survival and quality of life. To achieve this goal, general physicians and cardiologists must be aware of all the treatment options that are currently available in dedicated centres of excellence. Patients referred to these centres can benefit from a tailored heart team-based approach. The aim of this Review is to analyse the basic principles of mitral regurgitation, discussing new concepts on the pathophysiology of the mitral valve that have been developed to facilitate the selection of patients for transcatheter procedures. We also describe the indications and timing of treatment, contemporary surgical and transcatheter techniques and the heart team approach, and highlight the need for centres of excellence.  
Validation of four-dimensional flow cardiovascular magnetic resonance for aortic stenosis assessment.  ;The management of patients with aortic stenosis (AS) crucially depends on accurate diagnosis. The main aim of this study were to validate the four-dimensional flow (4D flow) cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) methods for AS assessment. Eighteen patients with clinically severe AS were recruited. All patients had pre-valve intervention 6MWT, echocardiography and CMR with 4D flow. Of these, ten patients had a surgical valve replacement, and eight patients had successful transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). TAVI patients had invasive pressure gradient assessments. A repeat assessment was performed at 3-4 months to assess the remodelling response. The peak pressure gradient by 4D flow was comparable to an invasive pressure gradient (54 ± 26 mmHG vs 50 ± 34 mmHg, P = 0.67). However, Doppler yielded significantly higher pressure gradient compared to invasive assessment (61 ± 32 mmHG vs 50 ± 34 mmHg, P = 0.0002). 6MWT was associated with 4D flow CMR derived pressure gradient (r = -0.45, P = 0.01) and EOA (r = 0.54, P < 0.01) but only with Doppler EOA (r = 0.45, P = 0.01). Left ventricular mass regression was better associated with 4D flow derived pressure gradient change (r = 0.64, P = 0.04). 4D flow CMR offers an alternative method for non-invasive assessment of AS. In addition, 4D flow derived valve metrics have a superior association to prognostically relevant 6MWT and LV mass regression than echocardiography.  
Prediction of adverse cardiac events in pregnant women with valvular rheumatic heart disease.  ;"OBJECTIVE: To assess the incidence of adverse cardiac events in pregnant women with rheumatic valvular heart disease (RHD) and to derive a clinical risk scoring for predicting it. METHODS: This is an observational study involving pregnant women with RHD, attending a tertiary centre in south India. Data regarding obstetric history, medical history, maternal complications and perinatal outcome till discharge were collected. Eight-hundred and twenty pregnancies among 681 women were included in the analysis. Primary outcome was composite adverse cardiac event defined as occurrence of one or more of complications such as death, cardiac arrest, heart failure, cerebrovascular accident from thromboembolism and new-onset arrhythmias. RESULTS: Of the 681 women with RHD, 180 (26.3%) were diagnosed during pregnancy. Composite adverse cardiac outcome during pregnancy/post partum occurred in 122 (14.9%) pregnancies, with 12 of them succumbed to the disease. In multivariate analysis, prior adverse cardiac events (OR=8.35, 95% CI 3.54 to 19.71), cardiac medications at booking (OR=0.53, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.86), mitral stenosis (mild OR=2.48, 95% CI 1.08 to 5.69; moderate OR=2.23, 95% CI 1.19 to 4.18; severe OR=7.72,95% 4.05 to 12.89), valve replacement (OR=2.53, 95% CI 1.28 to 5.02) and pulmonary hypertension (OR=6.90, 3.81 to 12.46) were predictive of composite adverse cardiac events with a good discrimination (area under the curve=0.803) and acceptable calibration. A predictive score combining these factors is proposed for clinical utility. CONCLUSION: Heart failure remains the most common adverse cardiac event during pregnancy or puerperium. Combining the lesion-specific characteristics and clinical information into a predictive score, which is simple and effective, could be used in routine clinical practice.  "
Munich Comparative Study: Prospective Long-Term Outcome of the Transcatheter Melody Valve Versus Surgical Pulmonary Bioprosthesis With Up to 12 Years of Follow-Up.  ;"BACKGROUND: Percutaneous pulmonary valve implantation (PPVI) has become an important treatment of right ventricular outflow tract dysfunction. Studies directly comparing the long-term outcome of PPVI with the Melody valve to surgical pulmonary valve replacement (SPVR) are lacking. METHODS: All patients treated with PPVI with the Melody valve and SPVR between January 2006 and December 2018 in our center were enrolled into a database and investigated with a standard follow-up protocol. The current study compares the outcomes in means of survival, reinterventions, infectious endocarditis, and performance of the valves. RESULTS: The study included 452 patients, of whom 241 were treated with PPVI with the Melody valve and 211 patients with SPVR with different types of valves. Median follow-up time was 5.4 years (3 months to 12.5 years), and the total observation was 2449 patient-years. Estimated survival after 10 years was 94% in the Melody group and 92% in the SPVR group (P=0.47). There was no difference in the estimated survival free of surgery on the implanted valve at 10 years (Melody, 87%, versus SPVR, 87%; P=0.54) or in the survival with the originally implanted pulmonary valve (Melody group, 80%; SPVR group, 73%; P=0.46) between both groups. The annualized incidence of infective endocarditis was 1.6% in the Melody group and 0.5% in the SPVR group, and the estimated survival free of endocarditis did not differ significantly between groups (Melody group, 82%; SPVR group, 86%; P=0.082). Survival free of valve replacement because of infective endocarditis was comparable between both groups (Melody, 88%; SPVR, 88%; P=0.35). CONCLUSIONS: PPVI with the Melody valve and SPVR provides similar survival, freedom of reinterventions, and infective endocarditis with or without the need of replacement of the pulmonary valve. Being less invasive, PPVI should be considered a method for treatment for patients with dysfunctional right ventricular outflow tracts.  "
Determinants and Impact of Heart Failure Readmission Following Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.  ;BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) readmission is common post-transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Nonetheless, limited data are available regarding its predictors and clinical impact. This study evaluated the incidence, predictors, and impact of HF readmission within 1-year post-TAVR, and assessed the effects of the prescription of HF therapies at discharge on the risk of HF readmission and death. METHODS: Patients included in the TAVR registry of a single expert center from 2009 to 2017 were analyzed. Competing-risk and Cox regressions were performed to identify predictors of HF readmission and death. RESULTS: Among 750 patients, 102 (13.6%) were readmitted for HF within 1-year post-TAVR. Overall, 53 patients (7.1%) experienced late readmissions (>30 days post-TAVR), and 17 (2.3%) had multiple readmissions. In ≈30% of readmissions, no trigger could be identified. Predominant causes of readmissions were changes in medication/nonadherence and supraventricular arrhythmia. Independent predictors of HF readmission included diabetes mellitus, chronic lung disease, previous acute HF, grade III or IV aortic regurgitation, and pulmonary hypertension both at discharge from the index hospitalization but not HF therapies. Overall, HF readmission did not significantly impact all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.36 [95% CI, 0.99-1.85]). However, late (HR, 1.90 [95% CI, 1.30-2.78]) and multiple HF readmissions (HR, 2.10 [95% CI,1.17-3.76]) were significantly associated with all-cause mortality. Prescription of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors at discharge was associated with a lower rate of all-cause mortality, especially among patients receiving doses of 25% to <50% (HR, 0.67 [95% CI, 0.48-0.94]) and 75% to 100% (HR, 0.61 [95% CI, 0.37-0.98]) of the optimal daily dose. CONCLUSIONS: HF readmission is common within 1-year of TAVR. Late and multiple HF readmissions associate with an increased risk of long-term all-cause mortality. Baseline comorbidities (diabetes, chronic lung disease, previous acute HF) and echocardiographic findings at discharge (grade III or IV aortic regurgitation, pulmonary hypertension) identified patients at high risk of HF readmission.  
Rheumatic mitral valve repair: the Score procedure.  ;We have defined a standard surgical procedure for rheumatic mitral valve repair (the Score procedure) including four steps: shaving, checking, commissurotomy, and relaxing. Here, we summarize the clinical pathological classification for making a decision on repair or replacement. Given the large number of patients in China, we consider it the responsibility of Chinese cardiac surgeons to adopt a therapeutic schedule for rheumatic mitral valve disease, which includes a simple operation with reliable effects and easy to promote. This schedule would ensure that millions of patients get the best treatment to extend survival and improve their quality of life.  
The science of BAV aortopathy.  ;The aortopathy associated with bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is an epidemiologically relevant source of chronic and acute aortic disease (aneurysm and dissection). However, its pathogenesis is still the object of scientific uncertainties and debates. Indeed, the mechanisms determining the diseases of the ascending aorta in BAV patients are most likely complex and multifactorial, i.e. resulting from variable modes of interplay between genetic and hemodynamic factors. Although few scientific studies have so far taken into adequate account this complexity, leaving the precise sequence of pathogenetic events still undiscovered, the accumulated evidence from previous research approaches have at least brought about important insights. While genetic studies have so far identified variants relevant to either valve malformation or aortic complications (including those in the genes NOTCH1, TGFBR2, ACTA2, GATA5, NKX2.5, SMAD6, ROBO4), however each explaining not more than 5% of the study population, other investigations have thoroughly described both the flow features, with consequent forces acting on the arterial wall (including skewed flow jet direction, rotational flow, wall shear stress), and the main changes in the molecular and cellular wall structure (including extracellular matrix degradation, smooth muscle cell changes, oxidative stress, unbalance of TGF-β signaling, aberrant endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition). All of this evidence, together with the recognition of the diverse phenotypes that the aortopathy can assume in BAV patients, holding possible prognostic significance, is reviewed in this chapter. The complex and multifaceted body of knowledge resulting from clinical and basic science studies on BAV aortopathy has the potential to importantly influence modes of clinical management of this disease in the near future.  
Speaking a common language: Introduction to a standard terminology for the bicuspid aortic valve and its aortopathy.  ;There is a growing need to develop a common language when referring to a frequent and heterogeneous condition such as the congenital bicuspid aortic valve and its aortopathy. The following short manuscript serves as an introduction to a standard terminology for the bicuspid aortic valve and its aortopathy.  
Genetics in bicuspid aortic valve disease: Where are we?  ;Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is the most common congenital heart defect, found in up to 2% of the population and associated with a 30% lifetime risk of complications. BAV is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait with incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity due to a complex genetic architecture that involves many interacting genes. In this review, we highlight the current state of knowledge about BAV genetics, principles and methods for BAV gene discovery, clinical applications of BAV genetics, and important future directions.  
Sex differences in bicuspid aortic valve disease.  ;Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV), the most frequent congenital heart disease, is characterized by an uneven distribution between sexes. BAV is three to four times more frequent in men than in women which could be associated with a reduced dosage of X chromosome genes. In addition, BAV has a multifactorial inheritance, low penetrance and variable phenotypes that may lead to different form of valve degeneration and dysfunction over time as well as different incidence of aortic valve and vascular complications between men and women. Definition of the phenotype is the first step in the evaluation of patients with BAV. Among the various phenotypes, BAV with a fusion raphe between the left and the right coronary cusp is the most frequent phenotype observed in men and women. It has been hypothesized that the valve and vascular related complications vary according to the BAV phenotype and this could explain differences in the clinical outcomes of men versus women. However, the evidence on the distribution of the various BAV phenotypes between sexes in not consistent and while some series have described differences between male and female, others have not confirmed those findings. In terms of valvular complications, women present more frequently with aortic stenosis while aortic regurgitation is more frequently diagnosed in men. Furthermore, endocarditis is more frequently reported in men as compared to women. In terms of vascular complications, men show larger diameters of the various parts of the aortic root and ascending aorta and more frequently present complications in terms of aortic aneurysm and dissection as compared to women. Although there are no survival differences between men and women with BAV, compared to the general population some large series have shown that women have worse prognosis. The present review article summarizes the differences between men and women in terms of BAV phenotype, type and incidence of aortic valve and vascular complications that will determine the differences in clinical outcomes.  
[Delayed coronary obstruction of the left main artery after transcatheter aortic valve replacement].  ;Coronary arteries obstruction associated with transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) may occur either during the procedure or after it. In the latter coronary obstruction can be further divided into early (7 days after procedure) or delayed one (7 days). Delayed coronary obstruction (DCO) is referred as a rare but devastating complication after TAVI and is associated with the extremely high mortality. This case demonstrates the objective difficulties of timely diagnostics of DCO. Since the results of non-invasive methods are indetermined in most cases, the authors conclude that even low-specific clinical symptoms must be interpreted as the definite rationale for the implementation of invasive diagnostic and treatment strategy.  
[Characterisation of circulating microRNA-21 levels in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy].  ;"AIM: To study the levels of circulating microRNA-21 in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) of different ages. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 49 patients with HCM. The proportion of females was 55.1%, males 44.9%. The average age was 50 [32; 65] (from 19 to 86 years). The control group for microRNA-21 included 44 healthy individuals, respectively, matched by the age and sex with the studied patients. Patients was made in accordance with the recommendations of the European society of cardiology. Plasma microRNA expression was determined by PCR with reverse transcription and real-time detection of results. The relative level of gene expression was calculated in accordance with the standard procedure 2-Ct. RESULTS: Septal wall thickness at end diastole has a significant negative correlation with age in patients with HCM (r=-0.56; р0.001). PWTd (posterior wall thickness at end diastole) has a significant positive correlation with age in patients with HCM (r=0.67, р0.001). The level of circulating microRNA-21 in plasma is higher in patients with HCM compared to healthy individuals (5.28 [2.64; 13.96] and 0.84 [0.55; 1.23], respectively; p0.001). Significantly higher levels of microRNA-21 were found in young patients aged from 19 to 45 years with the symptomatic course of HCM (36.76 [5.66; 42.22]) compared to patients with asymptomatic course 45 years of age (2.81 [1.45; 5.28]; p0.002) and symptomatic patients 45 years (3.88 [2.16; 8.63]; p0.002).) The calculated risk of SCD was significantly higher in young symptomatic patients with HCM (6.01 [3.64; 9.67]) compared to patients with asymptomatic course 45 years (2.41 [1.21; 3.89]; p0.001) and symptomatic patients 45 years (2.56 [1.67; 4.41]; p0.001). CONCLUSION: The level of circulating microRNA-21 is significantly in patients with HCM compared to control group. The maximum level of circulating microRNA-21 was detected in patients with symptomatic course of HCM at the age of 45 years.  "
Optimizing outcomes in infective endocarditis: A comprehensive literature review.  ;"BACKGROUND: Despite being rare, infective endocarditis (IE) is a life-threatening disease with poor prognosis. New diagnostic and therapeutic strategies are emerging; however, predisposing factors and microbiology of the disease are also changing with time. Because of this, there has been a lack of reduction in the disease's incidence and new challenges for clinicians have arisen such as an increasingly aging population and growing antimicrobial resistance. AIMS: In this paper, we aim to provide an overview of the changing trends in IE, current diagnosis, and management strategies, as well as the emerging role of the infective endocarditis teams in the care of patients with this disease. MATERIALS & METHODS: A comprehensive electronic search was done utilizing PubMed, Ovid, SCOPUS, Embase and google scholar. The search terms included 'Endocarditis', 'IE', 'Infection', 'Vegetation', 'Duke criteria', 'native valve infection', 'prosthetic valve', 'valve infection', 'endocarditis outcome' and 'endocarditis bacteriology'. The references of the identified articles were then searched for any potential articles that can be included. The inclusion criteria were any article that discussed the evidence behind incidence and management of IE including the role of endocarditis team. The exclusion criteria were case reports, expert opinion, and editorials. RESULTS: All the relevant findings are summarized in specified tables and within appropriate sections. DISCUSSION: It is vital to determine the current trends in the epidemiology and microbiology of the condition so that the diagnostic threshold can be adapted, to identify new at-risk groups and achieve an accelerated evaluation strategy that allows for earlier diagnosis and treatment. CONCLUSION: Management of IE can benefit from the input of different specialties, such as cardiology, cardiothoracic surgery, infectious disease, and microbiology. Therefore, adopting a multidisciplinary approach towards treatment is crucial to reduce morbidity and mortality from preventable complications of this pathology.  "
The use of an autologous right atrial free wall as a patch for closure of atrial septal defects.  ;"BACKGROUND: Various patch materials to close large atrial septal defects (ASDs) are autologous pericardium or a large of prosthetic patches which may be associated with infrequent but definite problems. We describe our experience with the use of the right atrial free wall patch over the last two decades. METHODS AND RESULTS: Between July 1998 and December 2017, 157 patients (mean age 14.7 ± 13.9 years), underwent ASD closure using the right atrial free wall patch. Associated lesions were severe mitral regurgitation (n = 24), partial anomalous pulmonary venous drainage (n = 15), ASD closure occurring after myxoma excision (n = 12) total anomalous pulmonary venous drainage (n = 2) and tricuspid regurgitation (n = 2). Surgery was uneventful in all patients. All patients underwent serial electrocardiography and echocardiography. Follow-up in 140 of 155 survivors was 103.6 ± 0.6 months. One hundred forty of one hundred fifty-five survivors are in sinus rhythm and three have persistent atrial fibrillation. Twenty-four hours of Holter monitoring (n = 19) revealed normal sinus rhythm in all but three patients, with occasional atrial ectopics in one patient; four were lost to follow-op. Electrophysiological studies in seven consenting patients, 9 to 16 months following ASD closure showed normal atrial potentials from the site of the patch. CONCLUSIONS: The autologous right atrial free wall is a safe patch material for ASD closure. Its advantages are that it is autologous, endothelialized, probably viable, and carries a low risk of thromboembolism. Studies with a larger number of patients with longer follow are needed to further confirm these findings.  "
Midterm results after St Jude Medical Epic porcine xenograft for aortic, mitral, and double valve replacement.  ;"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the results after stented porcine xenograft implantation (Epic, SJM, St Paul, MN) with Linx anticalcification treatment in elderly patients at our high-volume tertiary care center. METHODS: A total of 3825 patients undergoing aortic (AVR = 2441), mitral (MVR = 892), or double valve (DVR = 492) replacement between 11/2001 and 12/2017 with Epic xenografts were evaluated. Outcomes were assessed by reviewing the prospectively acquired hospital database results, and regular annual follow-up information was acquired from questionnaires or telephone interviews. RESULTS: For patients undergoing AVR, MVR, DVR, age at surgery were 76.4 ± 6, 71.2 ± 9, 72.9 ± 8 years; active endocarditis was an indication for valve surgery in 4.5%, 20.7%, 19.7%; and the predicted median (interquartile range [IQR]) mortality risk (EuroSCORE II) was 5.2% (3.1%-9.4%), 7.5% (3.9%-16.2%), 9.9% (6.0%-19.6%), respectively. Median follow-up was 3.04 (IQR: 0.18-5.21). Thirty-day survival was 91.2% ± 0.6%, 87.6% ± 0.1.1%, 84.7% ± 1.6%; and 10-year survival was 56.7% ± 1.0%, 59.4% ± 2.5%, 50.45% ± 3.1%, respectively. Patients who underwent MVR versus AVR were at significant increased risk for reoperation for endocarditis (adjusted odds ratio; 2.2, 95% confidence interval; 1.29-3.7; P = .003). There was no significant difference in all-cause mortality at midterm in AVR vs MVR in the matched cohort (P = .85). CONCLUSIONS: Implantation of the Epic stented porcine xenograft is associated with acceptable survival and freedom from valve-related complications or reoperation due to structural valve disease at midterm follow-up.

Infective endocarditis profile, prognostic factors and in-hospital mortality: 6-year trends from a tertiary university center in South America.  ;"BACKGROUND: Infective endocarditis (IE) remains an expressive health problem with high morbimortality rates. Despite its importance, epidemiological and microbiological data remain scarce, especially in developing countries. AIM: This study aims to describe IE epidemiological, clinical, and microbiological profile in a tertiary university center in South America, and to identify in-hospital mortality rate and predictors. METHODS: An observational, retrospective study of 167 patients, who fulfilled modified Duke's criteria during a six-year enrollment period, from January 2010 to December 2015. The primary outcome was defined as in-hospital mortality analyzed according to treatment received (clinical vs surgical). Multivariate analysis identified mortality predictors. RESULTS: The median age was 60 years (Q1 -Q3 50-71), and 66% were male. Echocardiogram demonstrated vegetations in 90.4%. An infective agent was identified in 76.6%, being Staphylococcus aureus (19%), Enterococcus (12%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (10%), and Streptococcus viridans (9.6%) the most prevalent. Overall in-hospital mortality was 41.9%, varying from 49.4% to 34.1%, in clinical and surgical patients, respectively (P = .047). On multivariate analysis, diabetes mellitus (odds ratio [OR], 2.5), previous structural heart disease (OR, 3.1), and mitral valve infection (OR, 2.1) were all-cause death predictors. Surgical treatment was the only variable related to a better outcomes (OR, 0.45; 95% Confidence Interval, 0.2-0.9). CONCLUSION: This study presents IE profile and all-cause mortality in a large patient's cohort, comprising a 6-years' time window, a rare initiative in developing countries. Elderly and male patients predominated, while S. aureus was the main microbiological agent. Patients conservatively treated presented higher mortality than surgically managed ones. Epidemiological studies from developing countries are essential to increase IE understanding.  "
Multiple mycotic arterial aneurysms involving the left anterior descending coronary artery following mitral and aortic valve endocarditis: A case report.  ;We present a 57-year-old man with recent Streptococcus viridans endocarditis on mitral and aortic valves who had a mycotic aneurysm of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery and associated superior mesenteric and cerebral artery aneurysms. The patient had preoperative renal failure and the infection was controlled with ceftriaxone. Mitral and aortic valve replacement were performed using tissue valves and the LAD aortic aneurysm was ligated and the patient had saphenous venous graft to the LAD. The postoperative course was complicated by pleural effusion and the patient had antibiotic therapy for 6 weeks postoperatively.  
Systematic use of intentional leaflet laceration to prevent TAVI-induced coronary obstruction: feasibility and early clinical outcomes of the BASILICA technique.  ;AIMS: The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility, efficacy and safety of the bioprosthetic or native aortic scallop intentional laceration to prevent iatrogenic coronary artery obstruction (BASILICA) technique during transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in an initial cohort at a single European centre. METHODS AND RESULTS: Between August 2018 and March 2020, BASILICA was attempted in 23 leaflets in 21 consecutive patients undergoing TAVI (age 78±6 years, 52% female). The index procedure was performed for 21 degenerated bioprosthetic leaflets (90%, 9.2±2.6 years after implantation) and two native leaflets (10%). BASILICA was performed for a single leaflet in 19 (90%) patients and for both leaflets in two (10%) patients. The median total procedure time was 82 (interquartile range [IQR] 70-131) minutes, and BASILICA time (sheath-in to laceration) was 45 (IQR 35-67) minutes. A cerebral embolic protection device was used in 20 (95%) patients. BASILICA was feasible in all but one patient (95%) and resulted in effective prevention of coronary obstruction in 19 patients (90%). One patient developed a non-flow-limiting ostial lesion after BASILICA and TAVI, and was treated by additional coronary stenting. No mortality or stroke was observed up to 30 days. CONCLUSIONS: The feasibility, efficacy and safety of BASILICA in this early single-centre experience were consistent with the initial proof-of-concept reports. Further validation by ongoing multicentre registries remains warranted. Visual summary. The Leipzig BASILICA experience.  
Diagnosis and Management of 1:1 Atrial Flutter in the Setting of Aortic Valve Endocarditis and Embolic Stroke.  ;Atrial flutter is a rapid, regular atrial tachyarrhythmia that occurs most commonly in patients with underlying structural heart disease. Spontaneous 1:1 conduction of atrial flutter is indeed rare, but its diagnosis and management is of critical importance. We describe a case of a 65-year-old man with hypertension, preserved ejection fraction heart failure, end-stage renal disease, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's dementia, in whom atrial flutter was associated with 1:1 atrioventricular conduction. Our patient was hemodynamically unstable with aortic valve endocarditis and recent septic embolic stroke. This case report emphasizes the importance of recognition and management to avoid hemodynamic compromise.  
Echocardiographic Characteristics of Subjects With COVID-19: A Case Series.  ;Although coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) manifests in most cases with respiratory symptoms, other presentations can occur. Direct damage to the cardiovascular system has been reported and recently, acute myocardial injury has been identified as a risk factor for mortality. Transthoracic echocardiography is a non-invasive tool that allows the detection of myocardial damage with validated markers (left ventricular ejection fraction and global longitudinal strain). Herein, we present the echocardiographic findings in four patients with COVID-19. All cases had acute respiratory distress syndrome (100%). Three out of four had elevated levels of creatine kinase and creatine kinase myocardial band. One case had ventricular concentric remodeling (25%). All cases (100%) had altered ventricular function: two had a reduced ejection fraction (50%) and, of those available for global longitudinal strain analysis, all had abnormal global longitudinal strain (100%). One case was found to have a tricuspid vegetation of 12 × 10 mm with no other manifestation of endocarditis. All of our cases had left ventricular dysfunction as assessed by echocardiography. One of our patients had a vegetation in the tricuspid valve. Two of our cases had a reduced ejection fraction. The importance of acute cardiac injury in COVID-19 has recently been established. A recent study found it to be an independent risk factor for mortality in patients with this disease. Information regarding echocardiographic characteristics of this population is scarce. Further research to elucidate the impact of these characteristics on morbidity and mortality is urgently needed.  
Causes, Diagnosis, Risk Stratification and Treatment of Bicuspid Aortic Valve Disease: An Updated Review.  ;The most common congenital heart disease is the bicuspid aortic valve. Understanding the pathophysiology and the altered hemodynamics is a key component for the diagnosis, risk stratification and treatment. Among others, aortic valve stenosis is the most common complication. Treatment strategies vary depending on the severity of the disease, particularly the dilation of the aorta playing a major role. Together with valve replacement, transcatheter aortic valve implantation is now considered as an alternative option with good results. With this review we would like to discuss the causes, diagnostic methods, risk stratification and treatment strategies of the bicuspid aortic valve.

Percutaneous mitral commissurotomy in women with asymptomatic severe mitral stenosis before pregnancy.  ;Objectives: Performing percutaneous mitral commissurotomy (PMC) in the women with asymptomatic severe mitral stenosis (MS) who plan a pregnancy is recommended. However the data regarding this recommendation is limited in the literature. We aimed to investigate maternal and fetal outcomes of women with asymptomatic severe MS who underwent PMC before a planned pregnancy.Methods: We retrospectively analysed the procedural, pregnancy related, and fetal outcomes of 33 consecutive women with severe asymptomatic MS, age 27.97 ± 2.86 years, who underwent PMC before a planned pregnancy between 2014 and 2019. The control group comprised of 66 pregnant women, age 29.09 ± 3.00 years, without a cardiac disease.Results: The PMC procedure was successful in all patients and no major complication occurred. There were no deaths, pulmonary oedema, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and thromboembolism during pregnancy. Maternal arrhythmia (p < .001), deterioration in NYHA class (p = .08), and use of cardiovascular medication (p < .001) was significantly higher in the study group. Maternal hospitalisation (p = .435), preeclampsia (p = 1), abortus (p = 1), fetal death (p = 1), and preterm delivery (p = .746) was similar between groups. Birth weight was significantly lower in the PMC group 2890 g (229) vs 3120 g (255) <0.001, however small for gestational age newborns were similar between groups (p = .12).Conclusions: PMC is safe in asymptomatic women with severe MS planning a future pregnancy. In selected patients with favourable valve anatomy PMC may improve maternal and fetal outcomes.  
Echocardiographic diagnosis and follow-up for ALCAPA syndrome treated with the Takeuchi procedure.  ;We present the case of an 18-year-old man with aborted sudden cardiac death. His initial echocardiogram suggested an anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery. Diagnosis was confirmed with coronary angiography. He underwent Takeuchi procedure and fully recovered. A two-year follow-up echocardiogram showed a moderate supravalvular pulmonary stenosis related to the transpulmonary baffle. The presence of extensive collateral circulation should raise suspicion of ALCAPA. Postoperative surveillance in this group of patients needs to be oriented in finding complications such as supravalvular pulmonary stenosis, aortic and pulmonary valve insufficiency, and baffle obstruction and leaks.  
Physiologic effects and functional outcome after treatment of dysfunctional right ventricular outflow tract in congenital heart disease using a two-stage intervention.  ;"BACKGROUND: Pathophysiological differences in relief of pulmonary stenosis (PS) as opposed to pulmonary regurgitation (PR) by percutaneous pulmonary valve implantation (PPVI) remain elusive, but might impact current assessment of procedural success and ultimately indications. METHODS: Invasive pressure measurements, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and cardiopulmonary exercise testing were performed before pre-stenting (BMS), after BMS and after PPVI in patients with either PS or PR. RESULTS: In PS (n = 14), BMS reduced the right ventricular (RV) to systemic pressure ratio (0.8 ± 0.2 vs. 0.4 ± 0.1%; p < .01), improved RF EF (53 ± 14 vs. 59 ± 12%; p = .01) but introduced free PR (PR fraction post 39 ± 12%; p < .01) with no changes in effective RV stroke volume (SV). PPVI eliminated PR (PR fraction 5 ± 3%; p < .01) and improved effective RV SV (p < .01) with no changes in RV EF (p = .47). Peak VO2 improved significantly after BMS, with no changes following PPVI (26 ± 9 vs. 30 ± 11 vs. 31 ± 10 ml/kg*min). In PR (n = 14), BMS exaggerated PR (PR fraction post 47 ± 10) with reduction in effective RV SV (pre 43 ± 9 vs. post 38 ± 8 ml/m2; p = .01), which improved after PPVI (post PPVI 49 ± 9 ml/m2; p < .01), secondary to elimination of PR (PR fraction 5 ± 4%; p < .01). RV EF (pre 53 ± 11 vs. post 53 ± 9 vs. post PPVI 50 ± 9%) and Peak VO2 (pre 22 ± 7 vs. post 21 ± 7 vs. post PPVI 23 ± 7 ml/kg*min) remained unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: Exercise capacity in patients with right ventricular outflow tract dysfunction is primarily afterload-dependent.  "
Single ventricle systolic function and cardiopulmonary exercise performance in adult patients with Fontan circulation.  ;"OBJECTIVE: We employed echocardiographic tissue characterization for the assessment of single ventricle systolic function and examined its relationship with cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) performance in the Fontan circulation. METHODS: 40 consecutive adult Fontan patients (16 female, 24 male; mean age 26.3 ± 5.9) were enrolled in our prospective cross-sectional study. All patients underwent echocardiographic assessment including tissue characterization and CPET within 3 days from each other. RESULTS: LAPSE (lateral annular plane systolic excursion) was higher in patients with a dominant left ventricle compared to a dominant right ventricle (12.3 + -2.6 vs 9.8 + -1.1 mm, p = .008) and in patients with AP (right atrium-pulmonary artery) connection than with lateral tunnel or extracardiac conduits (13.9 ± 1.7 vs 11.3 ± 2.6 and 10.9 ± 2.2 mm, p = .014 and p = .014, respectively). Maximal oxygen pulse (O2 pulse max) was significantly higher in patients with a dominant left or common ventricle compared to patients with a dominant right ventricle (10.3 and 12.0 vs 6.6 ml/beat, p = .002 and p = .032, respectively). There was a positive correlation between O2 pulse max and LAPSE (r = 0.442, p = .009), atrioventricular valve annulus systolic velocity (S') (r = 0.606, p < .0001), lateral wall basal segment systolic velocity (bas vel s) (r = 0.469, p = .009) and lateral wall mid segment systolic velocity (mid vel s) (r = 0.452, p = .012). In the multivariable regression model, S' (r = 0.606, p < .0001) remained predictive of O2 pulse max. CONCLUSIONS: LAPSE and S' are suitable parameters for the assessment of systolic function in Fontan patients. Subclinical systolic dysfunction of longitudinal fibers is associated with worse CPET performance. O2 pulse max seems to be the best parameter reflecting Fontan patients' physical performance.  "
Axillary access TAVR: Entrapment of a transcatheter aortic valve in the innominate artery with aortic dissection.  ;"Non-femoral transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is indicated when peripheral vascular disease is diagnosed. We describe the ""double-stick"" technique via the axillary artery. During the procedure, the pigtail coiled around the TAVR system. While retracting the TAVR sheath, the seam along system split dislodging the valve from the balloon. The valve was entrapped in the innominate artery, and an aortic dissection required surgery. With the double-stick technique, friction and resistance between the pigtail and delivery system must be avoided. Pre-procedural planning and early identification is paramount. Smaller and more seamless delivery systems may reduce risk for dissection and entrapment.  "

Ojha N(1), Dhamoon AS(2).  ;"Endocarditis is the inflammation of the endocardium, the innermost lining of the heart. Endocarditis may be due to infective or non-infective etiologies. Fungal endocarditis is an infrequent but debilitating condition with a poor prognosis. The disease can present as native valve endocarditis, prosthetic valve endocarditis, inflammation of the endocardial surface, and cardiac device-related infective endocarditis. Diagnosing fungal endocarditis is challenging; therefore, a high index of suspicion is required to arrive at a diagnosis.

Cardiac Surgery 2019 Reviewed.  ;"For the year 2019, almost 25,000 published references can be found in PubMed when entering the search term ""cardiac surgery."" We used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses approach for article selection and reviewed the main fields of adult cardiac surgery (i.e., coronary, valve, aortic, and heart failure surgery). The past decade has experienced an enormous development of interventional techniques that compete more and more with classic surgery. This contest was broadly visible in 2019. It peaked over the interpretation of the EXCEL trial data, where percutaneous coronary intervention and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) for left main disease were compared. A novel pathomechanism for CABG was proposed, potentially answering open questions in the field. In aortic valve surgery, two low-risk trials comparing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) to classic aortic valve replacement (surgical aortic valve replacement) received attention for showing equal or superior short-term outcomes for TAVI. Longer follow-up information from recent trials became available presenting results emphasizing the need for joint decision making. While publications addressing surgery on the aorta and the mitral and tricuspid valves were less abundant, there was substantial activity regarding left ventricular assist device support and heart transplantation. This article attempts to summarize the most pertinent publications. It does not expect to be complete and cannot be free of individual interpretation. We aimed to provide a condensed summary of 2019s publications with a stimulus for in-depth reading and a basis supporting patient information.  "
Classification of heart sound signals using a novel deep WaveNet model.  ;BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The high mortality rate and increasing prevalence of heart valve diseases globally warrant the need for rapid and accurate diagnosis of such diseases. Phonocardiogram (PCG) signals are used in this study due to the low cost of obtaining the signals. This study classifies five types of heart sounds, namely normal, aortic stenosis, mitral valve prolapse, mitral stenosis, and mitral regurgitation. METHODS: We have proposed a novel in-house developed deep WaveNet model for automated classification of five types of heart sounds. The model is developed using a total of 1000 PCG recordings belonging to five classes with 200 recordings in each class. RESULTS: We have achieved a training accuracy of 97% for the classification of heart sounds into five classes. The highest classification accuracy of 98.20% was achieved for the normal class. The developed model was validated with a 10-fold cross-validation, thus affirming its robustness. CONCLUSION: The study results clearly indicate that the developed model is able to classify five types of heart sounds accurately. The developed system can be used by cardiologists to aid in the detection of heart valve diseases in patients.  
Transcatheter aortic valve replacement in bicuspid aortic valve stenosis.  ;Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is the most common congenital cardiac abnormality in adults, and symptoms typically develops in adulthood. In the majority of cases, BAV disease progresses with age and surgical aortic valve replacement (AVR) is performed with excellent operative outcomes. Based on a series of randomized trials, transcatheter AVR (TAVR) has evolved from a novel technology to an established therapy for patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis (AS) regardless of risk profile. Despite exclusion of bicuspid anatomy from the randomized trials, an increasing number of patients with BAV-AS have been treated with TAVR. Recent observational studies showed the comparable outcomes of TAVR between bicuspid and tricuspid AS. However, worse outcomes in patients with unfavorable bicuspid anatomy such as calcified raphe plus excessive leaflet calcification have raised concerns for TAVR in younger and lower risk population. For the further expansion of TAVR toward BAV-AS population, we need randomized trials of TAVR in this population. Until then, previous registry data combined with computed tomographic-based anatomical assessment may guide the optimal therapy in patients with bicuspid anatomy.  
Embryonic development of bicuspid aortic valves.  ;Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is the most common congenital cardiac malformation, frequently associated with aortopathies and valvulopathies. The congenital origin of BAV is suspected to impact the development of the disease in the adult life. During the last decade, a number of studies dealing with the embryonic development of congenital heart disease have significantly improved our knowledge on BAV etiology. They describe the developmental defects, at the molecular, cellular and morphological levels, leading to congenital cardiac malformations, including BAV, in animal models. These models consist of a spontaneous hamster and several mouse models with different genetic manipulations in genes belonging to a variety of pathways. In this review paper, we aim to gather information on the developmental defects leading to BAV formation in these animal models, in order to tentatively explain the morphogenetic origin of the spectrum of valve morphologies that characterizes human BAV. BAV may be the only defect resulting from gene manipulation in mice, but usually it appears as the less severe defect of a spectrum of malformations, most frequently affecting the cardiac outflow tract. The genes whose alterations cause BAV belong to different genetic pathways, but many of them are direct or indirectly associated with the NOTCH pathway. These molecular alterations affect three basic cellular mechanisms during heart development, i.e., endocardial-to-mesenchymal transformation, cardiac neural crest (CNC) cell behavior and valve cushion mesenchymal cell differentiation. The defective cellular functions affect three possible morphogenetic mechanisms, i.e., outflow tract endocardial cushion formation, outflow tract septation and valve cushion excavation. While endocardial cushion abnormalities usually lead to latero-lateral BAVs and septation defects to antero-posterior BAVs, alterations in cushion excavation may give rise to both BAV types. The severity of the original defect most probably determines the specific aortic valve phenotype, which includes commissural fusions and raphes. Based on current knowledge on the developmental mechanisms of the cardiac outflow tract, we propose a unified hypothesis of BAV formation, based on the inductive role of CNC cells in the three mechanisms of BAV development. Alterations of CNC cell behavior in three possible alternative key valvulogenic processes may lead to the whole spectrum of BAV.  
Extracorporeal life support system during cardiovascular procedures: Insights from the German Lifebridge registry.  ;The frequency of mechanical circulatory support (MCS) device application has increased in recent years. Besides implantation in the emergency setting, such as circulatory arrest, MCS is also increasingly used electively to ensure hemodynamic stability in high-risk patients, for example, during percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI), valve interventions or off-pump coronary bypass surgery. Lifebridge (Zoll Medical GmbH, Germany) is a compact percutaneous MCS device widely used in daily clinical routine. The present study aimed to investigate the indications, feasibility, and outcomes after use of Lifebridge in cardiac interventions, evaluating a large-scale multicenter database. A total of 60 tertiary cardiovascular centers were questioned regarding application and short-term outcomes after the use of the Lifebridge system (n = 160 patients). Out of these 60 centers, eight consented to participate in the study (n = 39 patients), where detailed data were collected using standardized questionnaires. Demographic and clinical characteristics of the patient population, procedural as well as follow-up data were recorded and analyzed. In 60 interrogated centers, Lifebridge was used in 74% of emergency cases and 26% in the setting of planned interventions. The subcohort interrogated in detail displayed the same distribution of application scenarios, while the main cardiovascular procedure was high-risk PCI (82%). All patients were successfully weaned from the device and 92% (n = 36) of the patients studied in detail survived after 30 days. As assessed 30 days after insertion of the device, bleeding requiring red blood cell (RBC) transfusion constituted the main complication, occurring in 49% of cases. In our analysis of clinical data, the use of Lifebridge in cardiac intervention was shown to be feasible. Further prospective studies are warranted to identify patients who benefit from hemodynamic MCS support despite the increased rate of RBC transfusion due to challenges in access sites during cardiovascular procedures.  
Long-term outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve implantation in failed bioprosthetic valves.  ;"AIMS: Due to bioprosthetic valve degeneration, aortic valve-in-valve (ViV) procedures are increasingly performed. There are no data on long-term outcomes after aortic ViV. Our aim was to perform a large-scale assessment of long-term survival and reintervention after aortic ViV. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 1006 aortic ViV procedures performed more than 5 years ago [mean age 77.7 ± 9.7 years; 58.8% male; median STS-PROM score 7.3% (4.2-12.0)] were included in the analysis. Patients were treated with Medtronic self-expandable valves (CoreValve/Evolut, Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA) (n = 523, 52.0%), Edwards balloon-expandable valves (EBEV, SAPIEN/SAPIEN XT/SAPIEN 3, Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA, USA) (n = 435, 43.2%), and other devices (n = 48, 4.8%). Survival was lower at 8 years in patients with small-failed bioprostheses [internal diameter (ID) ≤ 20 mm] compared with those with large-failed bioprostheses (ID > 20 mm) (33.2% vs. 40.5%, P = 0.01). Independent correlates for mortality included smaller-failed bioprosthetic valves [hazard ratio (HR) 1.07 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02-1.13)], age [HR 1.21 (95% CI 1.01-1.45)], and non-transfemoral access [HR 1.43 (95% CI 1.11-1.84)]. There were 40 reinterventions after ViV. Independent correlates for all-cause reintervention included pre-existing severe prosthesis-patient mismatch [subhazard ratio (SHR) 4.34 (95% CI 1.31-14.39)], device malposition [SHR 3.75 (95% CI 1.36-10.35)], EBEV [SHR 3.34 (95% CI 1.26-8.85)], and age [SHR 0.59 (95% CI 0.44-0.78)]. CONCLUSIONS: The size of the original failed valve may influence long-term mortality, and the type of the transcatheter valve may influence the need for reintervention after aortic ViV.  "
Risk factors for permanent pacemaker implantation in patients receiving a balloon-expandable transcatheter aortic valve prosthesis.  ;"Permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI) is a widely recognized complication associated with TAVI (incidence up to 20%). Smaller registries have identified several variables associated with PPI. The objective was to validate patient- and transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI)-related procedural variables associated with PPI. We performed a retrospective analysis of patients from six European centers undergoing TAVI with the Edwards SAPIEN 3 prosthesis. Baseline variables and pre-procedural ECG characteristics and CT-scans were taken into account. Data for 1745 patients were collected; 191 (10.9%) required PPI after TAVI. The baseline variables pulmonary hypertension (OR 1.64; 95% CI 1.01-2.59), QRS duration > 117 ms (OR 2.58; 95% CI 1.73-3.84), right bundle branch block (RBBB; OR 5.14; 95% CI 3.39-7.72), left anterior hemi block (OR 1.92; 95% CI 1.19-3.02) and first-degree atrioventricular block (AVB, OR 1.63; 95%CI 1.05-2.46) were significantly associated with PPI. RBBB (OR 8.11; 95% CI 3.19-21.86) and first-degree AVB (OR 2.39; 95% CI 1.18-4.66) remained significantly associated in a multivariate analysis. Procedure-related variables included access site (TF; OR 1.97; 95% CI 1.07-4.05), implanted valve size (29 mm; OR 1.88; 95% CI 1.35-2.59), mean TAVI valve implantation depth below the annulus > 30% (OR 3.75; 95% CI 2.01-6.98). Patients receiving PPI had longer ICU stays and later discharges. Acute kidney injury stage 2/3 was more common in patients with PPI until discharge (15.2 vs. 3.1%; p = 0.007), but was not statistically significant thereafter. Further differences in outcomes at 30 days did not reach significance. The data will aid pre- and post-procedural patient management and prevent adverse long-term outcomes.Clinical Trial: NCT03497611.  "
The Rapid Transformation of Cardiac Surgery Practice in the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic: Insights and Clinical Strategies From a Center at the Epicenter.  ;BACKGROUND: The onset of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has forced our cardiac surgery program and hospital to enact drastic measures that has forced us to change how we care for cardiac surgery patients, assist with COVID-19 care, and enable support for the hospital in terms of physical resources, providers, and resident training. METHODS: In this review, we review the cardiovascular manifestations of COVID-19 and describe our system-wide adaptations to the pandemic, including the use of telemedicine, how a severe reduction in operative volume affected our program, the process of redeployment of staff, repurposing of residents into specific task teams, the creation of operation room intensive care units, and the challenges that we faced in this process. RESULTS: We offer a revised set of definitions of surgical priority during this pandemic and how this was applied to our system, followed by specific considerations in coronary/valve, aortic, heart failure and transplant surgery. Finally, we outline a path forward for cardiac surgery for the near future. CONCLUSIONS: We recognize that individual programs around the world will eventually face COVID-19 with varying levels of infection burden and different resources, and we hope this document can assist programs to plan for the future.  
Prevalence, predictors, and prognosis of tricuspid regurgitation following permanent pacemaker implantation.  ;This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and clinical significance of lead-related tricuspid regurgitation (TR) in patients with permanent pacemaker (PM). A total of 2,533 patients who underwent permanent PM implantation between January 2008 and December 2017 in a single center were retrospectively reviewed. Among them, 429 patients who underwent transthoracic echocardiography within 90 days before implantation and were followed up at least 3 months after PM implantation were included. Patients who had pre-existing grade 3 or 4 TR, had a single atrial lead, or had undergone tricuspid valve surgery before PM implantation were excluded. Occurrence of PM-related TR (PMTR) was defined as worsening of TR by at least 2 grades on follow-up echocardiography. Cardiovascular outcomes were defined as the composite of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure. During the median follow-up of 855 days, 42 (9.8%) patients had PMTR and 86 (20.0%) presented with cardiovascular outcomes. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, the presence of atrial fibrillation (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.07, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.27-4.09, p = 0.037]) and history of open-heart surgery (HR: 3.34, 95% CI: 1.68-6.68, p<0.001) were independently associated with PMTR. Patients with PMTR showed significantly higher cardiovascular events than those without (45.2 vs. 17.3%, log-rank p<0.001). Furthermore, PMTR was independently associated with the primary outcome (HR: 2.45, 95% CI: 1.43-4.22, p = 0.001). In conclusion, the occurrence of TR in patients with permanent PM is not uncommon. PMTR is associated with atrial fibrillation, the history of open-heart surgery, and poorer cardiovascular outcomes.  
Impact of the Iranian Registry of Infective Endocarditis (IRIE) and multidisciplinary team approach on patient management.  ;Backgrounds: The last 30 years have witnessed major improvements in understanding of all aspects of infective endocarditis (IE). The Iranian Registry of Infective Endocarditis (IRIE) was formed to address epidemiological aspects of IE vis-à-vis its main pathogens and underlying heart diseases over a 12-year period. Indeed, a multidisciplinary team (MDT) for IE was developed alongside.Methods: In a longitudinal observational study, data of adult patients with definite or possible IE based on modified Duke criteria were collected from 2007 to 2016 in our tertiary centre, Iran. From 2016 until 2019, we run a prospective observational study using formation of an IE MDT to provide better patient management and compared data before and after this.Results: Totally, 645 patients with mean age of 48 ± 17 years were enrolled. Data of 445 and 200 patients were compared before and after IRIE and MDT formation, respectively. We found significantly reduced type and number of applied antibiotics (p = 0.04) and higher rate of positive blood culture (p = 0.001). Hospital length of stay increased significantly after formation of the IRIE and IE MDT (p = 0.02). The rate of heart failure, new abscess formation and cerebral emboli were significantly decreased after IRIE and IE MDT (p < 0.001) and consequently in-hospital mortality reduced significantly (p = 0.05).Conclusion: Developing national registries and MDTs has potential to enhance patient management and reduce IE burden. Our results demonstrated that establishment of the Iranian IRIE and IE MDT conferred better diagnoses, standardised treatments and significantly reduced cardiac and extra cardiac morbidity.  
Minimally invasive access type related to outcomes of sutureless and rapid deployment valves.  ;"OBJECTIVES: Minimally invasive surgical techniques with optimal outcomes are of paramount importance. Sutureless and rapid deployment aortic valves are increasingly implanted via minimally invasive approaches. We aimed to analyse the procedural outcomes of a full sternotomy (FS) compared with those of minimally invasive cardiac surgery (MICS) and further assess MICS, namely ministernotomy (MS) and anterior right thoracotomy (ART). METHODS: We selected all isolated aortic valve replacements in the Sutureless and Rapid Deployment Aortic Valve Replacement International Registry (SURD-IR, n = 2257) and performed propensity score matching to compare aortic valve replacement through FS or MICS (n = 508/group) as well as through MS and ART accesses (n = 569/group). RESULTS: Postoperative mortality was 1.6% in FS and MICS patients who had a mean logistic EuroSCORE of 11%. Cross-clamp and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) times were shorter in the FS group than in the MICS group (mean difference 3.2 and 9.2 min; P < 0.001). Patients undergoing FS had a higher rate of acute kidney injury (5.6% vs 2.8%; P = 0.012). Direct comparison of MS and ART revealed longer mean cross-clamp and CPB times (12 and 16.7 min) in the ART group (P < 0.001). The postoperative outcome revealed a higher stroke rate (3.2% vs 1.2%; P = 0.043) as well as a longer postoperative intensive care unit [2 (1-3) vs 1 (1-3) days; P = 0.009] and hospital stay [11 (8-16) vs 8 (7-12) days; P < 0.001] in the MS group than in the ART group. CONCLUSIONS: According to this non-randomized international registry, FS resulted in a higher rate of acute kidney injury. The ART access showed a lower stroke rate than MS and a shorter hospital stay than all other accesses. All these findings may be related to underlying patient risk factors.  "
Analysis of Red Blood Cell Parameters in Dogs with Various Stages of Degenerative Mitral Valve Disease.  ;INTRODUCTION: Although peripheral blood analysis has become increasingly automated, microscopy is the only available method for the diagnosis of anisocytosis and poikilocytosis. The aims of the study were to compare RBC volume data obtained with two different analysers and by manual assessment of smears and to compare this data between dogs in various stages of heart failure secondary to degenerative mitral valvular (DMV) disease. The impact of diuretic administration on RBC morphology was also assessed. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixty-eight dogs, 56 in different stages of DMV disease and 12 as healthy controls, were studied. Impedance and flow cytometry haematological analyses were performed for each animal. Additionally, two smears were prepared for manual analysis. RBC structure, staining, and size differences were recorded. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the blood morphological parameters assessed using haematological analysers nor between dogs receiving diuretic treatment and those not treated. Based on the manual smear, significantly higher erythrocyte anisocytosis was observed in the dogs with symptomatic DMV disease than in the control group. CONCLUSION: Haematological analysers based on impedance and flow cytometry provide reliable and comparable morphological results in dogs with heart failure. However, microscopic assessment of blood smears is a more reliable tool to detect erythrocyte anisocytosis.  
Coronary and Structural Heart Disease Interventions During COVID-19 Pandemic: A Road Map for Clinicians and Health Care Delivery Systems.  ;"BACKGROUND: Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, cath labs have had to modify their workflow for elective and urgent patients. METHODS: We surveyed 16 physicians across 3 hospitals in our healthcare system to address COVID-19 related concerns in the management of interventional and structural heart disease patients, and to formulate system wide criteria for deferring cases till after the pandemic. RESULTS: Our survey yielded common concerns centered on the need to protect patients, cath lab staff and physicians from unnecessary exposure to COVID-19; for COVID-19 testing prior to arrival to the cath lab; for clear communication between the referring physician and the interventionalist; but there was initial uncertainty among physicians regarding the optimal management of ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI; percutaneous coronary intervention versus thrombolytics). Patients with stable angina and hemodynamically stable acute coronary syndromes were deemed suitable for initial medical management, except when they had large ischemic burden. Most transcatheter aortic valve implantations (TAVI) were felt appropriate for postponement except in symptomatic patients with aortic valve area <0.5 cm2 or recent hospitalization for heart failure (HF). Most percutaneous mitral valve repair (pMVR) procedures were felt appropriate for postponement except in patients with HF. All left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) and patent foramen ovale (PFO)/atrial septal defect (ASD) closure procedures were felt appropriate for postponement. CONCLUSION: Our survey of an experienced team of clinicians yielded concise guidelines to direct the management of CAD and structural heart disease patients during the initial phases of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Cardiovascular Risk Factors in Patients With Congenital Heart Disease.  ;Survival of infants born with congenital heart disease (CHD) is improving tremendously and although most of them have mild lesions, others might be considered as only being palliated and undergo many medical or surgical interventions. Patients with CHD will be exposed to the same problematic of the modern lifestyle such as increased prevalence of obesity, decreased physical activities, and exposure to smoking, which leads to acquired cardiovascular disease. We specifically investigated specific cardiovascular risk factors such as: malnutrition, smoking exposure, hypertension, integrity of the coronary and systemic arteries, thromboembolism, ventricular dysfunction, inflammation, and arrhythmias. Patients with CHD are often submitted to extremes of nutrition: as infants, they often do not meet their metabolic requirements, and as they grow older, they tend to exceed them, as seen in the general population. Some heart lesions are more prone to systemic hypertension throughout life, such as coarctation of the aorta, but surprisingly other lesions are also prone to hypertension such as Ebstein anomaly, pulmonary valve stenosis, or regurgitation. Early coronary artery atherosclerosis is also a concern in these patients. Lesions typically at risk are localized in zones of increased turbulence or high pressure or having had previous surgical manipulations. Thromboembolism is also frequent and mostly associated with arrhythmias, heart failure, multiple catheterizations, and specific surgical repairs. Finally, the complexity of heart lesions or abnormal hemodynamics lead to inflammation, heart failure, or arrhythmias. These complex interactions of risk factors ultimately lead to a decreased life expectancy.  
Safety and outcomes of combined liver transplantation and cardiac surgery in cirrhosis.  ;BACKGROUND: Decompensation of the liver function after cardiac surgery in patients with cirrhosis has resulted high morbidity and mortality. A treatment strategy, of which there is a scarcity of data in the literature, encompasses combined liver transplant (LT) and cardiac surgery. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data on 15 patients who underwent combined LT and cardiac surgery between 2005 to 2017 at our institution. RESULTS: Between 2005 and 2017, 15 patients with cirrhosis and coronary artery disease (CAD) and/or valve disease were identified who underwent combined LT and cardiac surgery. The cardiac disease was considered severe enough to preclude liver transplant alone. Likewise, the advanced cirrhosis precluded cardiac surgery alone. 80% of the patients were male and average age was 60. Six patients had CAD, two patients had severe aortic stenosis and CAD, one patient had severe mitral regurgitation and CAD, two patients had severe aortic stenosis, one patient had mitral valve prolapse, and three patients had severe aortic insufficiency. The mean model for end-stage liver disease score was 24. Four subjects were Child-Pugh class B and 11 were class C. One year survival was 73.3%. CONCLUSIONS: combined liver transplant and cardiac surgery is feasible in this selected, otherwise inoperable, patient population with an acceptable early and mid-term survival in high volume centers with a cohesive multidisciplinary team.  
Development of Persistent Opioid Use After Cardiac Surgery.  ;"Comment in Nat Rev Cardiol. 2020 Nov;17(11):683-684.  "
Mapping interventional cardiology in Europe: the European Association of Percutaneous Cardiovascular Interventions (EAPCI) Atlas Project.  ;AIMS: The European Association of Percutaneous Cardiovascular Interventions (EAPCI) Atlas of Interventional Cardiology has been developed to map interventional practice across European Society of Cardiology (ESC) member countries. Here we present the main findings of a 16-country survey in which we examine the national availability of interventional infrastructure, human resource, and procedure volumes. METHODS AND RESULTS: Sixteen ESC member countries participated in the EAPCI Atlas survey. Interventional data were collected by the National Cardiac Society of each participating country. An annual median of 5131 [interquartile range (IQR) 4013-5801] diagnostic heart procedures per million people were reported, ranging from <2500 in Egypt and Romania to >7000 in Turkey and Germany. Procedure rates showed significant correlation (r = 0.67, P = 0.013) with gross national income (GNI) per capita. An annual median of 2478 (IQR 1690-2633) percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs) per million people were reported, ranging from <1000 in Egypt and Romania to >3000 in Switzerland, Poland, and Germany. Procedure rates showed significant correlation with GNI per capita (r = 0.62, P = 0.014). An annual median of 48.2 (IQR 29.1-105.2) transcatheter aortic valve implantation procedures per million people were performed, varying from <25 per million people in Egypt, Romania, Turkey, and Poland to >100 per million people in Denmark, France, Switzerland, and Germany. Procedure rates showed significant correlation with national GNI per capita (r = 0.92, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The first report from the EAPCI Atlas has shown considerable international heterogeneity in interventional cardiology procedure volumes. The heterogeneity showed association with national economic resource, a reflection no doubt of the technological costs of developing an interventional cardiology service.  
[DIFFERENT ANESTHESIA APPROACHES IN THE TRANSCATHETER AORTIC VALVE IMPLANTATION (TAVI) PROCEDURE AND THEIR POSSIBLE EFFECT ON MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY].  ;BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is used in patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) who are at high surgical risk. Pre- and post-operative management is challenging as these patients are older, have significant comorbidities and a very high expected mortality rate in conventional surgery. There is no consensus in the literature about the preferred form of anesthesia, however, currently most centers perform the procedure using local anesthesia with sedation (LA-S). OBJECTIVES: To compare general anesthesia (GA) and LA-S in patients undergoing TAVI. METHODS: A retrospective review of the first 100 patients who underwent TAVI (11/2008-6/2011) at the Rabin Medical Center, due to severe and symptomatic AS and a counter-indication for conventional valve replacement surgery. RESULTS: A total of 46 patients underwent the procedure with GA and 54 with LA-S. In 63 patients, the transfemoral approach was used, transapical in 23, and transaxillary in 11. There were no significant differences in short- and long-term mortality, but average hospitalization was longer in the GA group. A larger proportion of patients needed norepinephrine and blood transfusions during the procedure in the GA group. In the LA-S group, more conduction, vascular complications and postoperative fever were observed. In comparisons between anesthesia methods with the transfemoral approach, most of the differences lost their significance. Therefore, these differences are most likely attributed to the surgical approach and not to the anesthesia method. CONCLUSIONS: There is no clear preference for GA in TAVI. LA-S appears to be an effective and safe option for eligible patients.  
Impact of Chronic Kidney Disease on Outcomes in Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.  ;"INTRODUCTION: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a significant comorbidity in aortic stenosis (AS) patients. We examined the impact of baseline CKD, postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) and CKD progression on clinical outcomes in patients who underwent transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Consecutive patients with severe AS who underwent TAVI were classified into CKD stages 1-2 (≥60 mL/min/1.72m2), 3 (30-59 mL/min/1.73m2) and 4-5 (<30 mL/min/1.73m2 or dialysis) based on estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Primary outcome was mortality and secondary outcomes included 1-year echocardiographic data on aortic valve area (AVA), mean pressure gradient (MPG) and aortic regurgitation (AR). RESULTS: A total of 216 patients were included. Higher eGFR was associated with lower overall mortality (adjusted hazards ratio [AHR] 0.981, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.968-0.993, P = 0.002). CKD 4-5 were associated with significantly higher mortality from non-cardiovascular causes (P <0.05). Patients with CKD 3-5 had higher incidence of moderate AR than those with CKD 1-2 (P = 0.010); no difference in AVA and MPG was seen. AKI patients had higher mortality (P = 0.008), but the effect was attenuated on multivariate analysis (AHR 1.823, 95% CI 0.977-3.403, P = 0.059). Patients with CKD progression also had significantly higher mortality (AHR 2.969, 95% CI 1.373-6.420, P = 0.006). CONCLUSION: CKD in severe AS patients undergoing TAVI portends significantly higher mortality and morbidity. Renal disease progression impacts negatively on outcomes and identifies a challenging subgroup of patients for optimal management.  "
Tricuspid valvuloplasty for isolated tricuspid regurgitation in children.  ;BACKGROUND: Isolated congenital tricuspid regurgitation other than Ebstein's anomaly was rare especially for children. The objective of this study was to investigate the clinical characteristics and to assess the results of tricuspid valvuloplasty for children with isolated tricuspid regurgitation. METHODS: From January 2010 to June 2019, 10 consecutive patients with isolated tricuspid regurgitation who were unresponsive to drug therapy underwent tricuspid valvuloplasty in our hospital. Patients' clinical data were analysed retrospectively. RESULTS: Mean age at operation was 48.5 ± 31.0 (range: 9-106) months and mean weight at operation was 16.1 ± 6.9 (range: 8.6-33.0) kg. All patients presented severe isolated tricuspid regurgitation. According to pathological lesions, the main causes accounted for chordae tendinea rupture (3/10), leaflet cleft (2/10), mal-connected chordal tendinea to leaflets (2/10), elongated chordae (1/10) and chordae absent (1/10), and severe anterior leaflet dysplasia (1/10). Individualised tricuspid valvuloplasty was adapted to all of them successfully. Post-operative echocardiography showed no tricuspid regurgitation in two patients and mild regurgitation in eight patients. The cardiothoracic ratios on their chest roentgenograms decreased from 0.59 ± 0.05 to 0.54 ± 0.05. At the latest follow-up (50.4 ± 47.2 months), echocardiography showed that mild to moderate tricuspid regurgitation in seven patients, moderate tricuspid regurgitation in three patients, and no patient with severe tricuspid regurgitation. All patients were in NYHA functional class I. CONCLUSIONS: For patients with isolated tricuspid regurgitation who were not well responsive to drug therapy, individualised tricuspid valve repair can achieve an excellent result.  
Coronary Access and Percutaneous Coronary Intervention Up to 3 Years After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation With a Balloon-Expandable Valve.  ;BACKGROUND: Coronary artery disease and aortic stenosis often coexist. Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has emerged as a valid therapeutic option for younger, lower-risk patients who may eventually require coronary artery disease treatment. Thus, post-TAVI coronary access (CA) and percutaneous coronary intervention are expected to increase. The purpose of this study was to retrospectively evaluate patients who were enrolled in the SOURCE 3 (SAPIEN 3 Aortic Bioprosthesis European Outcome) European registry for treatment with the balloon-expandable SAPIEN 3 transcatheter heart valve and underwent CA with or without percutaneous coronary intervention after TAVI. METHODS: Baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes of patients with or without CA up to 3 years after TAVI were compared. A Kaplan-Meier estimate with a univariate model determined the impact of CA on cardiac mortality. RESULTS: Of 1936 TAVI patients (mean age 81.6 years, 52% male), 68 (3.5%) had CA within 3 years (mean 441±332 days) after TAVI. At baseline, the logistic EuroSCORE was similar (20.2% versus 18.3%, P=0.2, CA and non-CA groups, respectively). Higher rates of coronary artery disease (76.5% versus 50.6%, P<0.001), myocardial infarction (20.6% versus 11.5%, P=0.03) and previous coronary artery bypass graft (22.1% versus 11.0%, P=0.01) were present in the CA group. In 100% of patients, CA was successfully achieved. The clinical success of percutaneous coronary intervention was 97.9%. Cardiovascular mortality was numerically higher in patients with CA than in those without CA. CONCLUSIONS: In the large SOURCE 3 European registry, CA was needed at 3-year follow-up after TAVI with a balloon-expandable valve in 3.5% of patients and was successful in all patients. The clinical success of percutaneous coronary intervention was 97.9%. Registration: URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov. Unique identifier: NCT02698956.  
Prevalence of Infective Endocarditis in Streptococcal Bloodstream Infections Is Dependent on Streptococcal Species.  ;BACKGROUND: Streptococci frequently cause infective endocarditis (IE), yet the prevalence of IE in patients with bloodstream infections (BSIs) caused by different streptococcal species is unknown. We aimed to investigate the prevalence of IE at species level in patients with streptococcal BSIs. METHODS: We investigated all patients with streptococcal BSIs, from 2008 to 2017, in the Capital Region of Denmark. Data were crosslinked with Danish nationwide registries for identification of concomitant hospitalization with IE. In a multivariable logistic regression analysis, we investigated the risk of IE according to streptococcal species adjusted for age, sex, ≥3 positive blood culture bottles, native valve disease, prosthetic valve, previous IE, and cardiac device. RESULTS: Among 6506 cases with streptococcal BSIs (mean age 68.1 years [SD 16.2], 52.8% men) the IE prevalence was 7.1% (95% CI, 6.5-7.8). The lowest IE prevalence was found with Streptococcus pneumoniae (S pneumoniae) 1.2% (0.8-1.6) and Spyogenes 1.9% (0.9-3.3). An intermediary IE prevalence was found with Sanginosus 4.8% (3.0-7.3), Ssalivarius 5.8% (2.9-10.1), and Sagalactiae 9.1% (6.6-12.1). The highest IE prevalence was found with Smitis/oralis 19.4% (15.6-23.5), Sgallolyticus (formerly Sbovis) 30.2% (24.3-36.7), Ssanguinis 34.6% (26.6-43.3), Sgordonii 44.2% (34.0-54.8), and Smutans 47.9% (33.3-62.8). In multivariable analysis using S pneumoniae as reference, all species except S pyogenes were associated with significantly higher IE risk, with the highest risk found with S gallolyticus odds ratio (OR) 31.0 (18.8-51.1), S mitis/oralis OR 31.6 (19.8-50.5), S sanguinis OR 59.1 (32.6-107), S gordonii OR 80.8 (43.9-149), and S mutans OR 81.3 (37.6-176). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of IE in streptococcal BSIs is species dependent with S mutans, S gordonii, S sanguinis, S gallolyticus, and S mitis/oralis having the highest IE prevalence and the highest associated IE risk after adjusting for IE risk factors.  
Familial Clustering of Aortic Size, Aneurysms, and Dissections in the Community.  ;BACKGROUND: Ruptured aortic aneurysm and aortic dissections are potentially preventable disorders associated with high mortality. Screening of individuals at risk may translate into elective surgical interventions and lowered mortality. It is uncertain if the risk of aortic dilation of varying degrees aggregates within families. METHODS: We investigated the risk of having thoracic and abdominal aortic sizes in the highest quartile (measured by computed tomography scans and indexed for body size) if at least 1 parent did so in the Framingham Heart Study cohorts, and estimated the incidence rates and hazard ratios of developing aortic aneurysm or dissection among first-degree relatives of those with aortic aneurysm or dissection, in comparison with age- and sex-matched controls (1:10 for aortic aneurysm and 1:100 for aortic dissection) using the Danish nationwide administrative registries. RESULTS: In the Framingham Heart Study, offspring (n=235) whose parent(s) had a sex- and age-standardized aortic size in the upper quartile had a multivariable-adjusted ≈3-fold increased odds ratio of belonging to the upper quartile themselves. In Denmark, a total of 68 939 individuals (mean age, 42 years) had a first-degree relative with aortic aneurysm and 7209 persons (mean age, 39 years) had a first-degree relative with aortic dissection. During an average follow-up of 7 years, first-degree relatives of patients with aortic aneurysm and dissection had a hazard ratio of 6.70 (95% CI, 5.96-7.52) for developing aortic aneurysm and a hazard ratio of 9.24 (95% CI, 5.53-15.44) for dissection in comparison with matched controls. These estimates remained unchanged on adjusting for several comorbidities, including prevalent hypertension, bicuspid aortic valve, and the Marfan syndrome. For both aortic aneurysm and dissections, the absolute event rates approached 1 per 1000 person-years for first-degree relatives versus 11 to 13 (aortic aneurysm) and 2 to 3 (aortic dissections) per 100 000 person-years among controls. CONCLUSIONS: Increased aortic size, a precursor of aortic aneurysm and a risk factor for dissection, clusters in families. The incidence rates of aortic aneurysm and dissections approach the incidence rates of other common cardiovascular conditions in first-degree relatives, supporting the use of systematic screening for these conditions.  
Thromboembolic and bleeding outcomes in patients with atrial fibrillation and valvular heart disease: A descriptive nationwide cohort study.  ;AIMS: The risks of thromboembolism and bleeding in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and valvular heart disease (VHD) are sparsely described. We described the risk of events in non-anticoagulated and anticoagulated patients with AF and VHD according to the evaluated heart valves, rheumatic or artificial valve classification (EHRA classification), EHRA Type 1 and Type 2 VHD, and within subgroups of EHRA Type 1 and Type 2 VHD. METHODS AND RESULTS: Cohort study of AF patients with coexisting VHD, identified in nationwide Danish registries from 2000 to 2018. Risk of thromboembolism and bleeding after 1 year of follow-up were calculated in each group. We identified 28 770 incident AF patients with VHD. Not surprisingly, we observed the highest risks of thromboembolism in the non-anticoagulated AF patients with EHRA Type 1 and Type 2 VHD (4.9% vs 2.6% and 3.2% vs 1.9%) and the highest risks of bleeding in the anticoagulated AF patients with EHRA Type 1 and Type 2 VHD (6.6% vs 4.3% and 6.1% vs 4.9%). However, within the subgroups of AF patients with EHRA Type 1 and Type 2 VHD, we observed a large proportion of non-anticoagulated patients (32.9%-49.2%), despite a CHA2 DS2 -VASc score of 2≤ in the majority of these patients (81.9%-95.6%). CONCLUSIONS: When using data reflecting contemporary clinical practice, we observed markedly different risks of thromboembolism and bleeding in EHRA Type 1 and Type 2 VHD. Additionally, we observed a potential underuse of oral anticoagulation within the subgroups of AF patients with EHRA Type 1 and Type 2 VHD, underlining need for further attention on this patient group.  
The rapid transformation of cardiac surgery practice in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic: insights and clinical strategies from a centre at the epicentre.  ;OBJECTIVES: The onset of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has forced our cardiac surgery programme and hospital to enact drastic measures that has forced us to change how we care for cardiac surgery patients, assist with COVID-19 care and enable support for the hospital in terms of physical resources, providers and resident training. METHODS: In this review, we review the cardiovascular manifestations of COVID-19 and describe our system-wide adaptations to the pandemic, including the use of telemedicine, how a severe reduction in operative volume affected our programme, the process of redeployment of staff, repurposing of residents into specific task teams, the creation of operation room intensive care units, and the challenges that we faced in this process. RESULTS: We offer a revised set of definitions of surgical priority during this pandemic and how this was applied to our system, followed by specific considerations in coronary/valve, aortic, heart failure and transplant surgery. Finally, we outline a path forward for cardiac surgery for the near future. CONCLUSIONS: We recognize that individual programmes around the world will eventually face COVID-19 with varying levels of infection burden and different resources, and we hope this document can assist programmes to plan for the future.  
Positron emission tomography imaging in cardiovascular disease.  ;Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging is useful in cardiovascular disease across several areas, from assessment of myocardial perfusion and viability, to highlighting atherosclerotic plaque activity and measuring the extent of cardiac innervation in heart failure. Other important roles of PET have emerged in prosthetic valve endocarditis, implanted device infection, infiltrative cardiomyopathies, aortic stenosis and cardio-oncology. Advances in scanner technology, including hybrid PET/MRI and total body PET imaging, as well as the development of novel PET tracers and cardiac-specific postprocessing techniques using artificial intelligence will undoubtedly continue to progress the field.  
Very early changes in quality of life after transcatheter aortic valve replacement: Results from the 3M TAVR trial.  ;"BACKGROUND: Patients with severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis derive substantial 30-day quality of life (QOL) benefit from transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Whether the QOL benefit of TAVR emerges earlier is unknown. We used data from the Multimodality, Multidisciplinary but Minimalist (3M) TAVR study to assess early changes in QOL after transfemoral (TF) TAVR. METHODS: Health status was assessed at baseline, 2-weeks, 30-days, and 1-year after TAVR using the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) and Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form 12 (SF-12). The KCCQ overall summary (KCCQ-OS) score (range 0-100; higher scores = better health) was the primary health status outcome. Linear mixed effects models were used to describe trajectories of QOL scores over time. A good outcome was defined as being ""alive and well"", with a KCCQ-OS score ≥ 60 points with no decrease from baseline ≥10 points. RESULTS: A total of 358 patients (87.1%) completed the baseline and at least one follow-up survey. Between baseline and 2-weeks, the KCCQ-OS increased by 21.3 points (95% confidence interval [CI]: 19.3-23.2). This improvement was sustained over time with only slight further improvement between 2-weeks and 1-month (3.4 points; 95% CI: 1.4 to 5.5) and no significant change between 1-month and 1-year (1.9 points; 95% CI: -0.2 to 4.1). Scores for the KCCQ subscales and SF-12 physical and mental component summary scales showed a similar pattern. Most patients (74.4%) were ""alive and well"" at 2 weeks with similar rates at 1-month and 1-year (79.5% and 77.3%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients undergoing TF-TAVR, both disease-specific and generic health status improved substantially within the first 2 weeks, with only minimal further improvement thereafter.  "
Cardiac amyloidosis in patient undergoing TAVR, why we need to think about it.  ;Systemic amyloidosis encompasses a variety of diseases characterized by extracellular deposition of protein-derived fibrils in different tissues and organs. Immunoglobulin light-chain (AL) and transthyretin (ATTR) amyloid are the two types that more commonly affect the heart and in both subtypes cardiac involvement is the main determinant of prognosis. Recently, several studies have suggested that Cardiac Amyloidosis (CA) and Aortic Stenosis (AS) can coexist more frequently than previously suspected with prevalence ranging from 5,6% to 16% in different cohorts. The unexpected high prevalence of CA in AS and the availability of potentially effective treatment in CA should push us to carefully investigate elderly patients with aortic valve stenosis in order to identify those with coexistent amyloidosis. While the motivation to exclude amyloidosis was in the past their exclusion from active treatment of the valve disease, judged as futile because of their poor unavoidable prognosis, the improved therapeutic options available challenges this conservative approach. Aim of this review is to identify the triggers to investigate AS patients at risk of having concomitant ATTR-CA, to propose a diagnostic path to reach diagnosis and to discuss the changes in the therapeutic strategy caused by this discovery in the era of TAVR and active pharmacological treatments to slow down disease progression.  
Cardiac hypertrophic risk markers of left ventricle and left atrium in chronic heart failure due to aortic and mitral valve disease.  ;"BACKGROUND: Chronic valvular heart disease leads to systolic dysfunction and left atrial enlargement that ultimately results in heart failure. PURPOSE: To investigate prognostic importance of Echocardiography and plasma natriuretic peptide levels that increase as a compensatory response and can be used as predictive markers for cardiac hypertrophy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The patients were divided into three groups: 51 with left ventricle hypertrophy due to aortic valve disease; 126 with left atrial enlargement due to mitral valve dysfunction; and 76 with both conditions. Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) plasma levels were measured in all three respective groups showing dilated cardiomyopathy. RESULTS: The mean left ventricular end-diastolic dimension at 64.3 ± 1.6 mm (P < 0.00) and left atrial dimension at 58.3 ± 3.7 mm (P < 0.00) were significantly high. However, patients with both conditions showed significantly high values for left ventricular end-diastolic dimension (63.3 ± 3 mm, P < 0.00) and left atrial dimension (54.9 ± 4 mm, P < 0.00) when compared with controls. A significant positive correlation was found between plasma natriuretic peptides levels and dilated cardiomyopathy. The mean values of ANP were 173 ± 46.6 pg/mL (P < 0.00), 140.4 ± 42.4 pg/mL (P < 0.00), and 295.1 ± 67.5 pg/mL (P < 0.00), significantly high in all three respective disease groups. The levels of BNP were also significantly high at 189 ± 44.5 pg/mL (P < 0.00), 166.6 ± 36.6 pg/mL (P < 0.00), and 323 ± 69.1 pg/mL (P < 0.00) in the disease groups with left ventricular hypertrophy, left atrial enlargement, and the disease group showing both characteristics, respectively. CONCLUSION: Significant positive associations were found between left ventricle hypertrophy and left atrial enlargement with ANP and BNP.  "
Distinguishing Septal Heart Defects from the Valvular Regurgitation Using Intelligent Phonocardiography.  ;This paper presents an original machine learning method for extracting diagnostic medical information from heart sound recordings. The method is proposed to be integrated with an intelligent phonocardiography in order to enhance diagnostic value of this technology. The method is tailored to diagnose children with heart septal defects, the pathological condition which can bring irreversible and sometimes fatal consequences to the children. The study includes 115 children referrals to an university hospital, consisting of 6 groups of the individuals: atrial septal defects (10), healthy children with innocent murmur (25), healthy children without any murmur (25), mitral regurgitation (15), tricuspid regurgitation (15), and ventricular septal defect (25). The method is trained to detect the atrial or ventricular septal defects versus the rest of the groups. Accuracy/sensitivity and the structural risk of the method is estimated to be 91.6%/88.4% and 9.89%, using the repeated random sub sampling and the A-Test method, respectively.  
Progression of left ventricular diastolic function in the neonate and early childhood from transmitral color M-mode filling analysis.  ;BACKGROUND: We implemented sophisticated color M-mode analysis to assess age-dependent progression of left ventricular (LV) diastolic function. METHODS: Normal infants were prospectively enrolled for serial echocardiograms at 1 week, 1 month, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years. From color M-mode scans, propagation velocity (VP), strength of filling (VS), and intraventricular pressure difference (IVPD) in 3 segments along apex-to-mitral valve scan line were measured. RESULTS: Age-wise comparisons of diastolic filling from 121 echocardiograms in 31 infants showed VP (cm/s), VS (cm2/s), and E-wave IVPD (mmHg) at 1 week to be 66.2 ± 11.9, 75.3 ± 19.9, and 1.5 ± 0.4, respectively, while VP, VS, and E-wave IVPD at 1 month were 80.3 ± 14.4, 101.2 ± 28.3, and 2.42 ± 1.1, respectively. There were significant differences in VP and segmental IVPD between first week and first month (p < 0.005) and IVPD between the age groups (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Comprehensive analysis of transmitral color M-mode data is feasible in infants, enabling calculation of pressure drop between the LV base and apex and strength of propagation from two distinct slopes. Profound changes very early followed by relatively constant filling mechanics in later infancy indicate significant LV maturation occurring during the first month of life. IMPACT: We implemented sophisticated analytic methods for color M-mode echocardiography in infants to assess age- and dimension-dependent changes in left ventricular diastolic function.Comprehensive characterization of transmitral color M-mode flow was feasible, enabling calculation of pressure drop between left ventricular base and apex and strength of propagation.Left ventricular diastolic filling function has predictable maturational progression, with significant differences in the intraventricular pressure between infants from birth to 2 years.This study forms the basis for future studies to examine alteration of early diastolic filling in congenital heart disease.  
Prospective Validation of PREDICT and its Impact on the Transesophageal Echocardiography Use in Management of Staphylococcus aureus Bacteremia.  ;"BACKGROUND: Infective endocarditis (IE) is the most feared complication of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB). Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) is generally recommended for all patients with SAB, however, supporting data for this are limited. We previously developed a scoring system, ""PREDICT"", that quantifies the risk of IE and identifies patients who would benefit the most from undergoing TEE. The current prospective investigation aims to validate this score. METHODS: We prospectively screened all consecutive adults (≥18 years) hospitalized with SAB at three Mayo Clinic sites between January 2015 and March 2017. RESULTS: Of 220 patients screened, 199 with SAB met study criteria and were included in the investigation. Of them, 23 (11.6%) patients were diagnosed with definite IE within 12 weeks of initial presentation based on modified Duke's criteria. Using the previously derived PREDICT model, the day 1 score of ≥4 had a sensitivity of 30.4% and a specificity of 93.8%, whereas day 5 score of ≤2 had a sensitivity and negative predictive value of 100%. Additional factors including surgery or invasive procedure in the past 30 days, prosthetic heart valve, and higher number of positive blood culture bottles in the first set of cultures were associated with increased risk of IE independent of the day 5 risk score. CONCLUSION: We validated the previously developed PREDICT scoring tools for stratifying risk of IE, and the need for undergoing a TEE, among cases of SAB. We also identified other factors with predictive potential, although larger prospective studies are needed to further evaluate possible enhancements to the current scoring system.

Artificial intelligence and automation in valvular heart diseases.  ;Artificial intelligence (AI) is gradually changing every aspect of social life, and healthcare is no exception. The clinical procedures that were supposed to, and could previously only be handled by human experts can now be carried out by machines in a more accurate and efficient way. The coming era of big data and the advent of supercomputers provides great opportunities to the development of AI technology for the enhancement of diagnosis and clinical decision-making. This review provides an introduction to AI and highlights its applications in the clinical flow of diagnosing and treating valvular heart diseases (VHDs). More specifically, this review first introduces some key concepts and subareas in AI. Secondly, it discusses the application of AI in heart sound auscultation and medical image analysis for assistance in diagnosing VHDs. Thirdly, it introduces using AI algorithms to identify risk factors and predict mortality of cardiac surgery. This review also describes the state-of-the-art autonomous surgical robots and their roles in cardiac surgery and intervention.  
Valvular Damage.  ;Valvular heart diseases (VHD) may be observed in patients with cancer for several reasons, including preexisting valve lesions, radiotherapy, infective endocarditis, and secondary to the left ventricle dysfunction. The incidence of VHD is especially in younger survivors treated with thoracic radiation therapy for certain malignancies, such as Hodgkin's lymphoma and breast cancer. The mechanism of radiation-induced damage to heart valves is not clear and includes diffuse fibrocalcific thickening of the valve. VHD is commonly diagnosed after a long latent period, in the context of clinical symptoms, or suspected on the basis of a new murmur. The evaluation includes identification of anatomical valve abnormalities, valve dysfunction, and assessing the functional consequences of valve dysfunction on the ventricles. Echocardiography is the optimal imaging technique for diagnostic and therapeutic management. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance and computed tomography (CT) may be used to assess the severity of VHD, but cardiac CT is mainly useful for detecting extensive calcifications of the ascending aorta. Patients exposed to mediastinal radiotherapy and minimal valve dysfunction require follow-up of 2-3 years, with moderate valve disease yearly, with severe, should be assessed for valve surgery.  
Intermittent mitral regurgitation in Cavalier King Charles spaniels: Short-term progression and influence of stress tests.  ;"In young Cavalier King Charles spaniels (CKCS), intermittent mitral regurgitation (iMR; defined as moderate to severe mitral regurgitation [MR] in a small proportion of heartbeats), has been associated with an increased risk of cardiac death due to myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD). It is associated with increased R-R interval variability. Little is known about response to physiological factors and whether iMR is a precursor for developing significant MR. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of stress testing on the presence of iMR and heart rate, and short-term (1-2 year) progression of MR in CKCS with and without iMR. In total, 52 CKCS were included. Substudy 1 enrolled six dogs with iMR and 11 dogs without iMR. Substudy 2 enrolled 14 dogs with iMR and 28 dogs without iMR. Substudy 1 prospectively assessed the influence of stress testing on the presence of iMR and heart rate. Substudy 2 retrospectively evaluated short-term progression of iMR. During stress testing, iMR disappeared in 50% of CKCS and no iMR was recorded at mean heart rates >150 beats/min. Heart rate response did not differ between CKCS with or without iMR. CKCS with iMR did not have a higher odds (odds ratio = 5.2; 95% confidence interval, 0.7-38.2) of MR progression compared to controls (P = 0.1). In conclusion, physical stress influenced the occurrence of iMR in CKCS, but heart rate response was not different from CKCS without iMR. Intermittent mitral regurgitation did not significantly predict short-term MR progression. In stressed CKCS with early disease, iMR may be overlooked.  "
Real-time cardiovascular magnetic resonance T1 and extracellular volume fraction mapping for tissue characterisation in aortic stenosis.  ;"BACKGROUND: Myocardial fibrosis is a major determinant of outcome in aortic stenosis (AS). Novel fast real-time (RT) cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) mapping techniques allow comprehensive quantification of fibrosis but have not yet been compared against standard techniques and histology. METHODS: Patients with severe AS underwent CMR before (n = 110) and left ventricular (LV) endomyocardial biopsy (n = 46) at transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Midventricular short axis (SAX) native, post-contrast T1 and extracellular volume fraction (ECV) maps were generated using commercially available modified Look-Locker Inversion recovery (MOLLI) (native: 5(3)3, post-contrast: 4(1)3(1)2) and RT single-shot inversion recovery Fast Low-Angle Shot (FLASH) with radial undersampling. Focal late gadolinium enhancement was excluded from T1 and ECV regions of interest. ECV and LV mass were used to calculate LV matrix volumes. Variability and agreements were assessed between RT, MOLLI and histology using intraclass correlation coefficients, coefficients of variation and Bland Altman analyses. RESULTS: RT and MOLLI derived ECV were similar for midventricular SAX slice coverage (26.2 vs. 26.5, p = 0.073) and septal region of interest (26.2 vs. 26.5, p = 0.216). MOLLI native T1 time was in median 20 ms longer compared to RT (p < 0.001). Agreement between RT and MOLLI was best for ECV (ICC > 0.91), excellent for post-contrast T1 times (ICC > 0.81) and good for native T1 times (ICC > 0.62). Diffuse collagen volume fraction by biopsies was in median 7.8%. ECV (RT r = 0.345, p = 0.039; MOLLI r = 0.40, p = 0.010) and LV matrix volumes (RT r = 0.45, p = 0.005; MOLLI r = 0.43, p = 0.007) were the only parameters associated with histology. CONCLUSIONS: RT mapping offers fast and sufficient ECV and LV matrix volume calculation in AS patients. ECV and LV matrix volume represent robust and universally comparable parameters with associations to histologically assessed fibrosis and may emerge as potential targets for clinical decision making.

Rao SS(1), Agasthi P(2).  ;Cardiac catheterization is required for many procedures such as angiography, angioplasty, valve replacement, valvuloplasty, ablation, or congenital heart repair. This process is required to assess and manage many patients presenting with myocardial infarction, heart disease, valvular disease, or congenital heart disease. Needless to say, catheterization is a heavily performed procedure in the field of interventional cardiology. A common site of entry for catheterization is the femoral artery. After catheterization procedures, appropriate mechanisms are necessary to close the port of entry of the catheter into the femoral artery. As a result, the need for devices to assist in the closure of the femoral artery is continually evolving. Initially, the only mechanism to assist in hemostasis from the catheter insertion site would be mechanical femoral artery compression. Although mechanical compression is sufficient in patients without certain comorbidities, it can be challenging in patients who are obese and on anticoagulation therapy. In addition, patients who were managed through femoral access require a longer hospital stay, as compared to those who received radial access. Manual compression would take a longer period of time to reach hemostasis, thus increasing strain on the healthcare system. Certain procedures such as the insertion of left ventricular assist devices and mitral/aortic valve replacement procedures require relatively larger femoral vascular access sites, making mechanical compression cumbersome, or a less effective method to achieve hemostasis. Femoral vascular closure devices can be divided into two broad categories. They can be either passive or active. Passive closure devices help with mechanical compression or by increasing thrombosis for effective hemostasis. However, passive devices do not hasten the actual time it takes to reach hemostasis. Active closure devices include suture devices, collagen plugs, and clips.  
Short- and Long-term Outcomes in Dialysis Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.  ;"BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has become the main treatment for symptomatic severe aortic stenosis, but patients on dialysis have been excluded from major randomized controlled trials. Our aim was to compare mortality and procedure-related complications after TAVI in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis vs those without. METHODS: EMBASE and MEDLINE were searched through November 2019 to investigate the comparative outcomes between patients with ESRD on dialysis and those without who underwent TAVI. The main outcomes were short-term (30-day/in-hospital) mortality and procedural complications, and long-term (>6 months) all-cause mortality. RESULTS: Our search identified 10 observational studies enrolling 128,094 (5399 on dialysis) patients who underwent TAVI. Dialysis patients had a significantly higher rate of short-term and long-term mortality than nondialysis patients (odds ratio [95% confidential interval]: 2.18 [1.64-2.89], P < 0.001, I2 = 60%; 1.91 [1.46-2.50], P < 0.001, I2 = 80%, respectively). In addition, dialysis patients had significantly higher rates of short-term life-threatening and/or major bleeding, permanent pacemaker implantation, and device failure compared with nondialysis patients (odds ratio [95% confidential interval]: 1.90 [1.24-2.90], P < 0.001, I2 = 67%; 1.33 [1.15-1.53], P < 0.001, I2 = 0%; 2.08 [1.05-4.10], P = 0.03, respectively), but did not have significantly higher rates of vascular complications and stroke. CONCLUSION: Dialysis patients had significantly higher rates of short- and long-term mortality, short-term life-threatening and/or major bleeding, permanent pacemaker implantation, and device failure compared with nondialysis patients. Careful selection of patients who would benefit from TAVI among patients with ESRD requiring dialysis is necessary to prevent high rates of postprocedural complications.  "
Aortic insufficiency associated with Impella that required surgical intervention upon implantation of the durable left ventricular assist device.  ;The Impella is an axial-flow percutaneous ventricular assist device for cardiogenic shock. In this report, we describe two patients who developed aortic insufficiency (AI) associated with Impella and required surgical intervention upon implantation of the durable left ventricular assist device (LVAD). Both patients presented with cardiogenic shock and underwent insertion of Impella 5.0 as a bridge to decision. The cardiac function in these patients did not improve and obtaining approval for heart transplantation required time. They were managed with Impella for 91 and 98 days, respectively. In both cases, moderate AI that was not present before Impella insertion was observed when the Impella was removed. Therefore, we performed aortic valve closure to control the AI during durable LVAD implantation. In patients with durable LVAD implantation, AI may occur and progress after the operation in several cases. Aortic valve surgery is often performed to prevent deterioration of AI, especially in patients with AI before the surgery. Hence, AI is an important complication following Impella device implantation as a bridge to decision. Careful observation of AI is essential when the Impella is removed as the evaluation of AI by echocardiogram during Impella management is cumbersome because of device-generated artifacts.

A Meta-analysis and Systematic Review of Valvular Heart Disease in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus and Its Association With Antiphospholipid Antibodies.  ;"BACKGROUND: Valvular heart disease (VHD) is a known cardiac manifestation of systematic lupus erythematosus (SLE). This systematic review aims to pool data from studies to estimate the frequency of valvular lesions in SLE patients. It also aims to demonstrate the association between VHD in SLE and antiphospholipid antibodies positivity. METHODS: We included 27 studies after identifying relevant abstracts from PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar from the time of inception of database to 2019. Inclusion criteria consisted of English-language case-control and cohort studies. Three reviewers independently performed study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for assessing risk for bias. RESULTS: For VHD in SLE patients, the most commonly involved valve was the mitral valve, with 19.7% lesions being mitral regurgitation. In terms of morphological lesions, valve thickening (11.06%) and vegetations (11.76%) were among the most prevalent. Other commonly encountered lesions were mitral valve prolapse and tricuspid regurgitation in 9.25% and 10.86% of patients, respectively. A meta-analysis of 21 studies with 2163 SLE patients, of which 23.3% had valvular lesions, showed a significant association of anticardiolipin antibodies positivity with VHD (relative risk, 1.55; confidence interval, 1.10-2.18). CONCLUSIONS: Systemic lupus erythematosus is associated with VHD, and it should be considered a clinical manifestation of SLE in the absence of other valvular pathologies. There is a clear association between VHD in SLE and immunoglobulin G anticardiolipin antibodies positivity. This association suggests that this subgroup of SLE patients might benefit from a screening echocardiogram.  "
Atypical cardiac defects in patients with RASopathies: Updated data on CARNET study.  ;BACKGROUND: RASopathies are a set of relatively common autosomal dominant clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorders. Cardiac outcomes in terms of mortality and morbidity for common heart defects (such as pulmonary valve stenosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy) have been reported. Nevertheless, also Atypical Cardiac Defects (ACDs) are described. The aim of the present study was to report both prevalence and cardiac outcome of ACDs in patients with RASopathies. METHODS: A retrospective, multicentric observational study (CArdiac Rasopathy NETwork-CARNET study) was carried out. Clinical, surgical, and genetic data of the patients who were followed until December 2019 were collected. RESULTS: Forty-five patients out of 440 followed in CARNET centers had ACDs. Noonan Syndrome (NS), NS Multiple Lentigines (NSML) and CardioFacioCutaneous Syndrome (CFCS) were present in 36, 5 and 4 patients, respectively. Median age at last follow-up was 20.1 years (range 6.9-47 years). Different ACDs were reported, including mitral and aortic valve dysfunction, ascending and descending aortic arch anomalies, coronary arteries dilation, enlargement of left atrial appendage and isolated pulmonary branches diseases. Five patients (11%) underwent cardiac surgery and one of them underwent a second intervention for mitral valve replacement and severe pericardial effusion. No patients died in our cohort until December 2019. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with RASopathies present a distinct CHD spectrum. Present data suggest that also ACDs must be carefully investigated for their possible impact on the clinical outcome. A careful longitudinal follow up until the individuals reach an adult age is recommended.  
Fungal endocarditis in transplant recipients: A systematic review.  ;BACKGROUND: Invasive fungal infections remain a major cause of morbidity and mortality in transplant recipients. Moreover, Fungal Infective Endocarditis (FIE) is a rare infection that carries a higher mortality than bacterial IE in normal host, while in transplant recipients may be even higher. The purpose of this study was to systemically review all published cases of FIE in solid organ and allogeneic bone marrow transplant recipients, describe the epidemiology, microbiology, clinical characteristics, treatment and outcomes of these infections, and to identify risk factors for mortality by FIE. METHODS: A systematic review of PubMed, Scopus and Cochrane Library (through 20 May 2020) for studies providing epidemiological, clinical, microbiological and treatment data and outcomes of FIE in transplant recipients was performed. RESULTS: A total of 60 studies, containing data of 72 patients, were included. The most common transplants were those of the kidney and the liver, while the commonest causative pathogen was Aspergillus. Mitral valve was the commonest infected intracardiac site, followed by mural endocardium. Diagnosis was made with transthoracic echocardiography in 44.3%, while the diagnosis was made at autopsy in 37.3%. Embolic phenomena were the commonest clinical presentation, followed by fever, heart failure and endophthalmitis. Amphotericin B, voriconazole and caspofungin were the commonest antifungals used for treatment of FIE. Clinical cure was noted in 26.9%, while overall mortality was 78.6%. Amphotericin B or caspofungin use was negatively associated with overall mortality. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review thoroughly describes IE in transplant recipients and provides information on epidemiology, clinical presentation, treatment and outcomes.  
Automated mitral valve vortex ring extraction from 4D-flow MRI.  ;PURPOSE: To present and validate a method for automated extraction and analysis of the temporal evolution of the mitral valve (MV) vortex ring from MR 4D-flow data. METHODS: The proposed algorithm uses the divergence-free part of the velocity vector field for Q criterion-based identification and tracking of MV vortex ring core and region within the left ventricle (LV). The 4D-flow data of 20 subjects (10 healthy controls, 10 patients with ischemic heart disease) were used to validate the algorithm against visual analysis as well as to assess the method's sensitivity to manual LV segmentation. Quantitative MV vortex ring parameters were analyzed with respect to both their differences between healthy subjects and patients and their correlation with transmitral peak velocities. RESULTS: The algorithm successfully extracted MV vortex rings throughout the entire cardiac cycle, which agreed substantially with visual analysis (Cohen's kappa = 0.77). Furthermore, vortex cores and regions were robustly detected even if a static end-diastolic LV segmentation mask was applied to all frames (Dice coefficients 0.82 ± 0.08 and 0.94 ± 0.02 for core and region, respectively). Early diastolic MV vortex ring vorticity, kinetic energy and circularity index differed significantly between healthy controls and patients. In contrast to vortex shape parameters, vorticity and kinetic energy correlated strongly with transmitral peak velocities. CONCLUSION: An automated method for temporal MV vortex ring extraction demonstrating robustness with respect to LV segmentation strategies is introduced. Quantitative vortex parameter analysis indicates importance of the MV vortex ring for LV diastolic (dys)function.  
A rare association of divided left atrium with mitral valve prolapse.  ;We hereby present a case of divided left atrium with mitral valve prolapse and discuss the hemodynamic consequences that ensue. This case demonstrates the utility of computed tomography angiography in identifying such associations.  
Epicardial ultrasound in a case of myocardial bridge and apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  ;A 59-year-old male with a history of unstable angina was diagnosed with a myocardial bridge of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and apical variant hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (AHCM). He underwent unroofing of the myocardial bridge and a left ventricular apical myectomy. Intraoperatively, epicardial ultrasound was used to identify the myocardial bridge with systolic compression of the LAD and confirm resolution of this compression postoperatively. Furthermore, epicardial ultrasound was used for guiding the degree of apical resection of the decompressed heart. This novel use of intraoperative epicardial ultrasound can help guide surgeons preoperatively and confirm results immediately after an operation.  
Simultaneous aortic valve endocarditis and mycotic pseudoaneurysm of aortic coarctation.  ;OBJECTIVE: This study highlights the management strategy in simultaneous bicuspid aortic valve infective endocarditis and mycotic pseudoaneurysm of an aortic coarctation. METHODS: A staged repair of mycotic pseudoaneurysm of aortic coarctation and infective bicuspid aortic valve endocarditis. RESULTS: We present a 19-year old gentleman who was admitted with aching pain in his bilateral lower extremities with associated purpuric rash and fevers. Work-up was significant for severe aortic valve regurgitation and a pseudoaneurysm in the distal aortic arch. He underwent operative repair through a left posterior-lateral thoracotomy with femoral-femoral partial cardiopulmonary bypass. Intraoperative findings were significant for a juxta-ductal coarctation and pseudoaneurysm. The mycotic pseudoaneurysm and remnant ligamentum arteriosum were completely resected and were replaced with a 18 mm Gelweave graft (Terumo Cardiovascular Group, Ann Arbor, MI) from the distal arch to the descending thoracic aorta. The patient underwent a planned secondary washout and omental flap for biologic coverage of the graft. Subsequently, a staged aortic valve replacement was completed 1 week later. The patient's postoperative course was uncomplicated, and he was discharged with intact motor and sensory function. CONCLUSIONS: A staged approach is a prudent strategy to manage a patient with simultaneous endocarditis and aortic mycotic pseudoaneurysm, with precedence toward the most critical lesion.  
Echocardiographic L-wave as a prognostic indicator in transcatheter aortic valve replacement.  ;This study applies L-wave measurements of mid-diastolic trans-mitral flow. Although considered to be a marker of elevated filling pressure or delayed myocardial relaxation, its clinical and prognostic value is yet to be completely elucidated. It has been shown that transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) induces reverse remodeling and improves diastolic function and prognosis in patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS). Our purpose was to evaluate the prognostic value of L-wave following TAVR. We examined clinical and echocardiographic data of patients undergoing TAVR. L-Wave presence and velocity were recorded at baseline and at 1 month and 6 months following TAVR. The effect of the procedure on L-wave measurements and its impact on mortality and other clinical outcomes were analyzed. A total of 502 patients (mean age 82.58 ± 5.9) undergoing TAVR were included. Patients with baseline L-wave (n = 68, 12%) had a smaller stroke volume index by 5.7 ± 2.3 ml/m2 (p = 0.01) as compared to patients without L-wave at baseline. L-waves disappeared In 35% and 70% of patients at 1 month and at 6 months respectively. Baseline L-wave velocity was 34.8 ± 11.5 (cm/s) and decreased significantly at follow-up examinations. Patients with persistent L-wave following TAVR had higher 3-year adjusted mortality rates (HR 5.7, 95% CI 3.7-8.9, p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis of survival was also statistically significant (p < 0.001). TAVR induces L-wave disappearance and a decrease in L-wave velocity in patients with severe AS. L-wave persistence following TAVR is an independent risk factor for mortality.  
Serum untargeted metabolomic changes in response to diet intervention in dogs with preclinical myxomatous mitral valve disease.  ;"Myocardial energy deprivation plays a causal role in the development of heart failure. A cardiac protection blend (CPB) of nutrients including medium chain triglycerides, fish oil and other key nutrients was developed to slow the progression of canine myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD). A six-month dietary intervention demonstrated efficacy of CPB in slowing MMVD progression. Untargeted metabolomic analysis of serum from these dogs identified 102 differential metabolites (adjusted P < 0.05). The ratios of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acid (FA) changed from 2.41 and 1.46 in control and CPB groups at baseline to 4.30 and 0.46 at 6 months respectively. A 2.7-fold increase of α-aminobutyrate, a myocardial modulator of glutathione homeostasis, was found in CPB dogs compared to 1.3-fold increase in control dogs. Arginine and citrulline, precursors of nitric oxide biosynthesis, were both increased 2-fold; caprate, a medium chain FA, was increased 3-fold; and deoxycarnitine, precursor of carnitine biosynthesis, was increased 2.5-fold in CPB dogs. Margarate and methylpalmitate decreased in response to CPB, a potential benefit in MMVD dogs as positive correlations were found between changes in both these FAs and left atrial diameter (r = 0.69, r = 0.87 respectively, adjusted P < 0.05). Sphingomyelins with very long chain saturated FAs associated with decreased risk of heart failure in humans were increased in MMVD dogs fed the CPB diet. Our data supports the hypothesis that CPB improves FA utilization and energetics, reduces oxidative stress and inflammation in MMVD dogs. More studies are needed to understand the roles of specific metabolites in MMVD.  "
Infective Endocarditis After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.  ;"BACKGROUND: Infective endocarditis may affect patients after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to provide detailed information on incidence rates, types of microorganisms, and outcomes of infective endocarditis after TAVR. METHODS: Between February 2011 and July 2018, consecutive patients from the SwissTAVI Registry were eligible. Infective endocarditis was classified into early (peri-procedural [<100 days] and delayed-early [100 days to 1 year]) and late (>1 year) endocarditis. Clinical events were adjudicated according to the Valve Academic Research Consortium-2 endpoint definitions. RESULTS: During the observational period, 7,203 patients underwent TAVR at 15 hospitals in Switzerland. During follow-up of 14,832 patient-years, endocarditis occurred in 149 patients. The incidence for peri-procedural, delayed-early, and late endocarditis after TAVR was 2.59, 0.71, and 0.40 events per 100 person-years, respectively. Among patients with early endocarditis, Enterococcus species were the most frequently isolated microorganisms (30.1%). Among those with peri-procedural endocarditis, 47.9% of patients had a pathogen that was not susceptible to the peri-procedural antibiotic prophylaxis. Younger age (subhazard ratio [SHR]: 0.969; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.944 to 0.994), male sex (SHR: 1.989; 95% CI: 1.403 to 2.818), lack of pre-dilatation (SHR: 1.485; 95% CI: 1.065 to 2.069), and treatment in a catheterization laboratory as opposed to hybrid operating room (SHR: 1.648; 95% CI: 1.187 to 2.287) were independently associated with endocarditis. In a case-control matched analysis, patients with endocarditis were at increased risk of mortality (hazard ratio: 6.55; 95% CI: 4.44 to 9.67) and stroke (hazard ratio: 4.03; 95% CI: 1.54 to 10.52). CONCLUSIONS: Infective endocarditis after TAVR most frequently occurs during the early period, is commonly caused by Enterococcus species, and results in considerable risks of mortality and stroke.

Simplified, minimally invasive, beating-heart technique for redo isolated tricuspid valve surgery.  ;"BACKGROUND: Redo isolated tricuspid valve surgery is associated with a high morbidity and mortality, and its optimal timing remains controversial. Hence, here we reviewed the early and midterm results of simplified, minimally invasive, beating-heart technique for redo isolated tricuspid valve surgery in patients at high risk. METHODS: A total of 32 consecutive patients underwent a redo isolated tricuspid valve surgery using minimally invasive, beating-heart technique through a right lateral thoracotomy in our center between June 2016 and April 2020. The mean age of patients was 57.4 ± 8.3 years, and 18 patients (56.3%) were women. The mean preoperative EuroSCORE was 7.8 ± 1.4 (range: 6-11). Follow-up was 87.1% complete, with a mean duration of 26.3 ± 12.3 months. RESULTS: Both in-hospital and 30-day mortalities were 3.1%. Tricuspid valve replacement with bioprosthesis was performed in 30 patients (93.8%), and the remaining two patients (6.2%) underwent tricuspid repair (annuloplasty and leaflet reconstruction). The mean cardiopulmonary bypass time was 81.5 ± 29.0 min. The overall in-hospital duration and intensive care unit (ICU) times were 13.6 ± 7.6 days and 4.1 ± 2.8 days, respectively. Postoperative complications included prolonged ventilation in six patients (18.8%), acute kidney injury in three patients (9.4%), and neurologic event, wound infection, or permanent third-degree atrioventricular block, in one patient (3.1%) each. A total of 96.9% patients were discharged uneventfully. Four patients were lost to follow-up; there were no midterm deaths in patients who were followed up. CONCLUSIONS: Simplified, minimally invasive, beating-heart technique for redo tricuspid valve surgery is both feasible and safe, and the early and midterm results are excellent.  "
Accumulation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) is associated with the severity of aortic stenosis in patients with concomitant type 2 diabetes.  ;"BACKGROUND: Accumulation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) leads to chronic glycation of proteins and tissue damage, particularly in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). We aimed to evaluate whether increased accumulation of AGEs in patients with aortic stenosis (AS) and concomitant type 2 diabetes (DM) is associated with AS severity. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 76 patients with severe AS (47.1% males; nonDM), aged 68 [66-72] years, and 50 age-matched DM patients with a median blood glucose level of 7.5 [5.9-9.1] mM and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) of 6.8 [6.3-7.8]%, scheduled for aortic valve replacement. Valvular expression of AGEs, AGEs receptor (RAGE), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) induction were evaluated ex vivo by immunostaining and calculated as the extent of positive immunoreactive areas/total sample area. Plasma levels of AGEs and soluble RAGE (sRAGE) were assessed by ELISAs. RESULTS: Subjects with DM had increased valvular expression of both AGEs (6.6-fold higher, 15.53 [9.96-23.28]%) and RAGE (1.8-fold higher, 6.8 [4.9-8.45]%) compared to nonDM patients (2.05 [1.21-2.58]% and 2.4 [1.56-3.02]%, respectively; both p < 0.001). Plasma levels of AGEs (12-fold higher) and sRAGE (1.3-fold higher) were elevated in DM patients, compared to nonDM (both p < 0.0001). The percentage of valvular ROS-positive (2.28 [1.6-3.09] vs. 1.15 [0.94-1.4]%, p < 0.0001) but not IL-6-positive areas was higher within DM, compared to nonDM valves. In DM patients, the percentage of valvular AGEs- and RAGE-positive areas correlated with HbA1c (r = 0.77, p < 0.0001 and r = 0.30, p = 0.034). Similarly, plasma AGEs and sRAGE levels were associated with HbA1c in the DM group (r = 0.32, p = 0.024 and r = 0.33, p = 0.014, respectively). In all DM patients, we found an association between the amount of valvular AGEs and the disease severity measured as aortic valve area (AVA; r = 0.68, p < 0.0001). Additionally, in DM patients with HbA1c > 7% (n = 24, 48%) we found that valvular expression of AGEs correlated with mean transvalvular pressure gradient (PGmean; r = 0.45, p = 0.027). Plasma AGEs levels in the whole DM group correlated with AVA (r = - 0.32, p = 0.02), PGmean (r = 0.31, p = 0.023), and PGmax (r = 0.30, p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that poorly-controlled diabetes leads to increased AGEs and RAGE valvular accumulation, which at least partially, might result in AS progression in DM patients.  "
Vascular Complications in the Era of Transcatheter Treatment of Adult Structural Heart Disease: A Single-Center Early Experience.  ;Transcatheter treatment is becoming the mainstay treatment for structural heart diseases (SHD) in prohibitive surgical risk patients. Recently with the encouraging results, it is being offered to regular risk patients. Peripheral vascular complications (VCs) are still inherent to these procedures due to the nature of this atherosclerotic high-risk group and the profile of the devices. This is a single-center early first year experience with such events occurring after initiating a SHD program treating severe aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation, mitral valve prolapse and regurgitation, as well as paravalvular leaks. Out of 33 patients in this time period, 5 developed PV complications which are detailed in this article with their associated risk factors and management. These include access-related complications, closure device issues, arterial rupture post device embolization, and vessel dissection. Vascular complications of those procedures take special interest since they are associated with a worse long-term prognosis. Thus, prevention with proper planning remains of essence along with multidisciplinary management.  
Pathological Role of Receptor for Advanced Glycation End Products in Calcified Aortic Valve Stenosis.  ;Background Aortic stenosis (AS) is highly prevalent in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and the receptor for AGEs (RAGE) play a pivotal role for vascular calcification in atherosclerosis. We hypothesize that the AGEs-RAGE axis could also be involved in the pathophysiological mechanism of calcified AS. Methods and Results A total of 54 patients with calcified AS who underwent aortic valve replacement were prospectively enrolled from 2014 to 2016 (mean age 75.3±7.7 years). Aortic valve specimens were obtained from 47 patients and 16 deceased control subjects without aortic valve disease (mean age 63.2±14.5 years). The valvular expression of RAGE was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Serum levels of AGEs and soluble RAGE were measured in 50 patients with calcified AS and 70 age-matched and sex-matched control subjects without heart disease. The valvular RAGE expression in patients with calcified AS was higher than controls (P=0.004) and was significantly associated with a decreased ankle-brachial pressure index (P=0.007) and an increased intima-media thickness (P=0.026). RAGE and α-smooth muscle actin were coexpressed and were partially costained with osteocalcin and alkaline phosphatase. The serum levels of AGEs and soluble RAGE were significantly higher in the patients with calcified AS than in the controls (P=0.013 and P<0.001, respectively). Soluble RAGE (inversely) and use of aspirin were independently correlated with changes in left ventricular systolic function after aortic valve replacement (P=0.012 and P=0.002, respectively). Conclusions Our present study suggests that RAGE may play a role in the pathogenesis of calcified AS, which is a prognostic marker in patients with AS after aortic valve replacement.  
3D-printing in preoperative planning in neonates with complex congenital heart defects.  ;The application of the 3D printing approach in medicine is currently becoming increasingly popular. The management of fetuses and newborns with congenital heart defects is often difficult, primarily due to the complexity of the anatomy. Here we report a newborn with a complex congenital malformation (absent pulmonary valve syndrome associated with tetralogy of Fallot), which could be clinically interpreted in different ways. 3D printing allowed to elucidate the exact anatomy more precisely and direct the cardiosurgeon to a definitive treatment.  
Safety and Efficacy of Ahmed Valve on Intractable Glaucoma in Saudi Population.  ;PURPOSE: The study aims to assess the efficacy and safety of Ahmed glaucoma valve implant in eyes with intractable glaucoma and to evaluate the risk factors for failure. METHODS: A retrospective evaluation of 83 patients (117 eyes) with intractable glaucoma who underwent silicone Ahmed glaucoma valve implant was done in a tertiary care center in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, between January 2014 and December 2016. Complete success was defined as intraocular pressure (IOP) ≤21 mmHg without medication after a minimum follow-up of 6 months. RESULTS: Eighty-three patients (117 eyes) with intractable glaucoma were evaluated. After a mean follow-up duration of 20.8 ± 3.1 (12-24) months, the overall success rate was achieved in 104 eyes (88.9%). Thirty-six eyes (30.8%) had a complete success rate, whereas 68 eyes (58.1%) had a qualified success rate. Thirteen eyes (11.1%) failed to achieve controlled IOP. The postoperative probability to fail was found to be increasing with time from 0.9% (0.9) in the 1st month to 11.1% (9.9) after 1 year. Complications included a hypertensive phase in 25 eyes (21.4%), encapsulation in 10 eyes (8.5%), hyphema in 7 eyes (6%), hypotony in 2 eyes (1.7%), and blood clots in the implanted tube in 2 eyes (1.7%). The presence of hyphema, scleral patch, and coronary heart diseases was found to increase the risk of failure after Ahmed valve implantation (P = 0.006, 0.040, and 0.014, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Ahmed glaucoma valve implant was safe and effective in treating cases of intractable glaucoma.  
Adult Congenital Heart Disease Outpatient Clinic. Descriptive Analysis of A 12-Year Experience in Brazil.  ;OBJECTIVE: Description of adult congenital heart disease (CHD) outpatient characteristics has not been reported and several aspects regarding these patients require attention. We describe the 12-year experience of a Brazilian unit. METHODS: The main characteristics of 1168 patients were reviewed annotating for each patient age, gender, city of residence, main diagnosis, functional class at last examination, defect complexity and in-hospital referral pattern. RESULTS: Increasing workload was documented. Among the CHD patients, 663 (57%) were between 14 and 30 years old and 920 (79%) lived in the referral region. Referrals were made by hospital cardiologists for 611 (52%) patients, while 519 (45%) were referred by pediatric cardiologists. Regarding CHD severity, 637 (55%) had a defect of mild complexity. Of the patients analyzed, 616 (53%) had undergone an intervention, mainly atrial septal defect (ASD) closure, correction of tetralogy of Fallot, ventricular septal defect (VSD) closure and relief of coarctation of the aorta (CoAo). The main diagnosis of the 552 (47%) patients not submitted to an intervention were ASD, VSD, aortic stenosis, complex CHD and pulmonary stenosis. Regarding functional class, 1016 (87%) were in class I and 280 (24%) were lost to follow-up. Seventy-three patients had died, mainly due to cardiac death. CONCLUSION: In a unit were complex pediatric congenital heart surgery started twenty years ago, an increasing adult CHD workload was documented. Referral came predominantly from cities around the unit, most patients had low complexity defects and were in functional class I, a significant loss of follow-up was documented, and the death of patients was mainly due to the heart defect.  
Bioprosthetic valve infective endocarditis: why is it important?  ;DOI: 10.1136/heartjnl-2020-317141 PMID: 32546509  
Early results of the ongoing Polish Registry of Valve Thrombosis after Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (ZAK‑POLTAVI).  ;BACKGROUND: Conflicting data exist regarding the risk factors for transcatheter heart valve thrombosis (THVT). In addition, no optimal pharmacological strategy to treat THVT has been established so far Aims: The aim of this study was to assess the incidence, risk factors, diagnostic workup, and treatment of THVT in Poland. METHODS: Data were collected retrospectively in themulticenter registry of patients with THVT (ZAK‑POLTAVI) between November 2008 and November 2018. Transcatheter heart valve thrombosis was defined as an increased mean transvalvular gradient accompanied by a decreased effective orifice area or severe aortic regurgitation, reversible after treatment. Baseline characteristics and procedural data were compared between patients with THVT and those without THVT (matched by age, sex, and diabetic status). RESULTS: In a group of 2307 patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), 26 patients with THVT were identified (incidence, 1.14%). In half of the patients, THVT was diagnosed within 6 months after TAVI. As compared with the control group, patients with THVT more frequently had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (P = 0.035), a smaller aortic valve area (P = 0.007), a higher mean postprocedural transvalvular gradient (P = 0.037), and a lower platelet count (P = 0.029) at the time of the diagnosis. A total of 24 patients (84.6%) received anticoagulation therapy for THVT, and complete resolution of THVT was noted in 12 individuals (46.1%). We observed thromboembolic complications in 2 patients (7.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Transcatheter heart valve thrombosis is a rare complication of TAVI. However, a higher risk of THVT may be expected in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a smaller aortic valve area, a higher mean postprocedural transvalvular gradient, and a lower platelet count. Anticoagulation alone or combined with antiplatelet therapy seems to be the optimal pharmacological treatment in this population.  
Sex-Specific Outcomes in Cardiovascular Device Evaluations.  ;Background: Females have historically been underrepresented in cardiovascular device trials. As a result, differences in outcomes for males and females are not possible to be determined in subanalyses. Materials and Methods: Against a backdrop of troubling trends in cardiovascular outcomes for females, we provide a narrative review on the differences in outcomes observed in females undergoing device evaluations in multiple fields of cardiovascular medicine, including coronary revascularization, structural heart disease, and heart failure. We also review predictors of cardiovascular trial nonparticipation as it may provide avenues by which female enrollment in cardiovascular device trials can be improved. Results: Advances have been made in structural heart therapy, where female representation in transcatheter aortic valve replacement studies was nearly 50%. For other indications, coronary revascularization and heart failure, there was clearly a disparity in female recruitment. On average, female representation was 25% in major clinical trials evaluating drug eluting stents, implantable cardioverter defibrillators, cardiac resynchronization defibrillators, and ventricular assist devices. As a result, the best treatment recommendations for females in these fields are currently guided by outcomes evaluated primarily in males. Conclusions: Female enrollment in device clinical trials for coronary revascularization and heart failure has lagged, leaving uncertainty in making benefit/risk assessments of device therapy. The predictors of female nonparticipation in clinical trials can inform a comprehensive strategy to facilitate and enrich the enrollment of females in cardiovascular device trials. This is critical to ensure that sex differences can be considered in treatment selection, so that patients can receive the best available care.  
Identification by mass spectrometry and immunoblotting of xenogeneic antigens in the N- and O-glycomes of porcine, bovine and equine heart tissues.  ;Animal bioprosthetic heart valves (BHV) are used to replace defective valves in patients with valvular heart disease. Especially young BHV recipients may experience a structural valve deterioration caused by an immune reaction in which α-Gal and Neu5Gc are potential target antigens. The expression of these and other carbohydrate antigens in animal tissues used for production of BHV was explored. Protein lysates of porcine aortic and pulmonary valves, and porcine, bovine and equine pericardia were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-carbohydrate antibodies and lectins. N-glycans were released by PNGase F digestion and O-glycans by β-elimination. Released oligosaccharides were analyzed by liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry. In total, 102 N-glycans and 40 O-glycans were identified in animal heart tissue lysates. The N- and O-glycan patterns were different between species. α-Gal and Neu5Gc were identified on both N- and O-linked glycans, N,N´-diacetyllactosamine (LacdiNAc) on N-glycans only and sulfated O-glycans. The relative amounts of α-Gal-containing N-glycans were higher in bovine compared to equine and porcine pericardia. In contrast to the restricted number of proteins carrying α-Gal and LacdiNAc, the distribution of proteins carrying Neu5Gc-determinants varied between species and between different tissues of the same species. Porcine pericardium carried the highest level of Neu5Gc-sialylated O-glycans, and bovine pericardium the highest level of Neu5Gc-sialylated N-glycans. The identified N- and O-linked glycans, some of which may be immunogenic and remain in BHVs manufactured for clinical use, could direct future genetic engineering to prevent glycan expression rendering the donor tissues less immunogenic in humans.  
Incidence, predictors, and outcome of prosthesis-patient mismatch after transcatheter aortic valve replacement: A meta-analysis.  ;BACKGROUND: Prosthesis-patient mismatch (PPM) following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is common, but the incidence, predictors and outcome of PPM are still controversial. METHODS: A total of 18 articles incorporating 72,016 patients were identified form PubMed and Embase online database. RESULTS: The pooled incidences of overall, and severe PPM following TAVR were 32.0% and 10.0% separately. Comparing to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR), TAVR had lower incidence of overall (OR, 0.31, 95% CI, 0.20-0.50) and severe PPM (OR, 0.38, 95% CI, 0.28-0.52). PPM was associated with a larger body surface area (BSA), larger body mass index (BMI) and previous myocardial infarction in comparison with those patients without PPM. Although PPM was not rare after TAVR, no significant differences were observed both in short- and mid-term all-cause mortality (30 day: OR: 1.51, 95% CI, 0.79-2.87, 1 year: OR: 1.02, 95% CI, 0.96-1.08, and 2 years: OR: 0.99, 95% CI, 0.79-1.24) between patients with PPM and those without PPM. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the fact that the incidence of PPM was lower than that of SAVR, PPM was not seen to have an impact on short- and mid-term survival.

Clinical outcomes and hemodynamic performance of Dafodil™ aortic and mitral pericardial bioprosthesis: 1-year results from Dafodil-1 first-in-human trial.  ;"BACKGROUND: Bioprosthesis has been increasingly implanted for the treatment of transvalvular disease across the world. A new Dafodil™ pericardial bioprosthesis (Meril Life Sciences Pvt. Ltd., India) recently approved by Conformité Européenne (CE) is a tri-leaflet, stented, bovine valve. The purpose of Dafodil-1 first-in-human trial was to evaluate clinical safety and performance (including hemodynamic parameters) of the Dafodil pericardial bioprosthesis in patients who underwent aortic or mitral valve replacement. METHODS: This prospective, multicenter clinical trial enrolled 60 patients (Aortic: 30 patients; Mitral: 30 patients) from seven sites across India. Safety endpoints were early (≤30 days) and late (> 30 days) mortality and valve-related morbidity. The performance endpoints were hemodynamic performance, improvement in NYHA functional class, and change in the quality of life using SF-12v1 health survey. RESULTS: From July 2017 to July 2018, 60 patients underwent implantation of the Dafodil pericardial bioprosthesis. Post-operatively, NYHA functional class significantly improved in all the patients (Aortic: 90% NYHA class-I and 10% NYHA class-II; Mitral: 96.55% NYHA class-I and 3.45% NYHA class-II; P < 0.001). There was no death in aortic valve replacement patients till 12-month. In mitral valve replacement patients, early mortalities occurred in three patients, and late mortality occurred in one patient; none of these were valve-related. Freedom from all-cause mortality reported was 93.33% at 12-month. Mean aortic pressure gradient decreased from 52.71 ± 24.47 mmHg [with 0.89 ± 0.70 cm2 effective orifice area (EOA)] pre-operatively to 14.49 ± 6.58 mmHg (EOA: 1.85 ± 0.27 cm2) at 12-month. Overall, the mitral mean pressure gradient and EOA were 4.41 ± 1.69 mmHg and 2.67 ± 0.48 cm2, respectively, at 12-month. Significant improvement (P < 0.05) in the patients' quality of life was reported at all follow-ups. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical safety and performance of the Dafodil pericardial bioprosthesis were favourable at 12-month. Moreover, a study with a larger patient population and longer follow-up is warranted to further assess the device. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Dafodil-1 trial has been prospectively registered on 10/07/2017 under Clinical Trial Registry-India (http://www.ctri.nic.in). (Registration number: CTRI/2017/07/009008).  "

Janeway lesion and Infective Endocarditis.  ;Infective endocarditis (IE) is defined as infection of the endocardial surface of the heart which may involve heart valve, mural endocardium or septal defect. It's a disease with high morbidity and mortality without prompt treatment with antibiotics. Janeway lesions, Osler's node and splinter hemorrhages are the classical signs of infective endocarditis described previously. However, these signs are not commonly seen nowadays. In this present paper, we would like to illustrate a case of IE with typical Janeway lesions.

Clinicopathological Bird's-Eye View of Left Atrial Myocardial Fibrosis in 121 Patients With Persistent Atrial Fibrillation: Developing Architecture and Main Cellular Players.  ;"BACKGROUND: Scientific research on atrial fibrosis in atrial fibrillation (AF) has mainly focused on quantitative or molecular features. The purpose of this study was to perform a clinicoarchitectural/structural investigation of fibrosis to provide one key to understanding the electrophysiological/clinical aspects of AF. METHODS: We characterized the fibrosis (amount, architecture, cellular components, and ultrastructure) in left atrial biopsies from 121 patients with persistent/long-lasting persistent AF (group 1; 59 males; 60±11 years; 91 mitral disease-related AF, 30 nonmitral disease-related AF) and from 39 patients in sinus rhythm with mitral valve regurgitation (group 2; 32 males; 59±12 years). Ten autopsy hearts served as controls. RESULTS: Qualitatively, the fibrosis exhibited the same characteristics in all cases and displayed particular architectural scenarios (which we arbitrarily subdivided into 4 stages) ranging from isolated foci to confluent sclerotic areas. The percentage of fibrosis was larger and at a more advanced stage in group 1 versus group 2 and, within group 1, in patients with rheumatic disease versus nonrheumatic cases. In patients with AF with mitral disease and no rheumatic disease, the percentage of fibrosis and the fibrosis stages correlated with both left atrial volume index and AF duration. The fibrotic areas mainly consisted of type I collagen with only a minor cellular component (especially fibroblasts/myofibroblasts; average value range 69-150 cells/mm2, depending on the areas in AF biopsies). A few fibrocytes-circulating and bone marrow-derived mesenchymal cells-were also detectable. The fibrosis-entrapped cardiomyocytes showed sarcolemmal damage and connexin 43 redistribution/internalization. CONCLUSIONS: Atrial fibrosis is an evolving and inhomogeneous histological/architectural change that progresses through different stages ranging from isolated foci to confluent sclerotic zones which-seemingly-constrain impulse conduction across restricted regions of electrotonically coupled cardiomyocytes. The fibrotic areas mainly consist of type I collagen extracellular matrix and, only to a lesser extent, mesenchymal cells.  "
Peripheral arterial disease and transcatheter valve replacement outcomes.  ;Patients with PAD have worse outcomes after TAVR. The extent and distribution of PAD are important considerations in determining TAVR feasibility and choosing an access site. Further research is needed to establish the best approaches to treating patients with aortic and iliofemoral disease severe enough to limit device delivery.

Evaluation of aortic stenosis using cardiovascular magnetic resonance: a systematic review & meta-analysis.  ;BACKGROUND: As the average age of patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) who receive procedural intervention continue to age, the need for non-invasive modalities that provide accurate diagnosis and operative planning is increasingly important. Advances in cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) over the past two decades mean it is able to provide haemodynamic data at the aortic valve, along with high fidelity anatomical imaging. METHODS: Electronic databases were searched for studies comparing CMR to transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE) in the diagnosis of AS. Studies were included only if direct comparison was made on matched patients, and if diagnosis was primarily through measurement of aortic valve area (AVA). RESULTS: Twenty-three relevant, prospective articles were included in the meta-analysis, totalling 1040 individual patients. There was no significant difference in AVA measured as by CMR compared to TEE. CMR measurements of AVA size were larger compared to TTE by an average of 10.7% (absolute difference: + 0.14cm2, 95% CI 0.07-0.21, p < 0.001). Reliability was high for both inter- and intra-observer measurements (0.03cm2 +/- 0.04 and 0.02cm2 +/- 0.01, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis demonstrates the equivalence of AVA measurements using CMR compared to those obtained using TEE. CMR demonstrated a small but significantly larger AVA than TTE. However, this can be attributed to known errors in derivation of left ventricular outflow tract size as measured by TTE. By offering additional anatomical assessment, CMR is warranted as a primary tool in the assessment and workup of patients with severe AS who are candidates for surgical or transcatheter intervention.  
[Clinical analysis of intravenous-cardiac leiomyomatosis].  ;Objective: To summarize the clinical characteristics, treatment and prognosis of patients with right intravenous-cardiac leiomyomatosis, and provide references for clinical diagnosis and management. Methods: The clinical data of 22 patients who were admitted to Department of Cardiac Surgery in Beijing Anzhen Hospital from November 2009 to July 2019 were retrospectively reviewed. The long-term prognosis of the patients was also evaluated. Results: All patients were women, with an age of (48.1±6.3) years. The clinical manifestations of patients lacked specificity. Among them, 14 patients had a history of uterine leiomyoma, 12 had hysterectomy, and 5 had abortions. Twenty patients underwent tumor resection. One-stage operation was performed in 15 cases, while staging surgery was performed in 5 cases. Ten cases underwent tumor resection under cardiopulmonary bypass. One case underwent a tricuspid valve annuloplasty at the same time. There was no death early in postoperative period. Early complications included deep venous thrombosis (2 cases), type Ⅱ atrioventricular block (1 case), pleural effusion (1 case) and incision infection (1 case). In the long-term follow-up (3 years), one case died of tumor recurrence-associated circulatory failure. Among the rest of the patients, the quality of life was satisfying, and cardiac function was between grade Ⅰ and Ⅱ, with no recurrence or metastasis. Conclusions: Patients with intravenous-cardiac leiomyomatosis are lack of specific manifestations. Early diagnosis is crucial for the treatment of this disease. Tumor resection is an effective treatment, which can improve the quality of life and long-term survival of patients.  
Impact of inferior caval valve implantation on severity of tricuspid regurgitation and right heart function.  ;AIMS: Severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is a common finding in heart failure patients and associated with increased mortality. New interventional therapeutic options are needed as many heart failure patients are unfit for surgery. The TRICAVAL study compared valve implantation into the inferior vena cava (CAVI) with optimal medical therapy (OMT) in patients with severe TR. Here, we report details on the impact of CAVI on TR severity as well as right heart function and morphology. METHODS AND RESULTS: We randomized 28 patients with severe TR to CAVI (n = 14) with transfemoral implantation of an Edwards Sapien XT valve into the inferior vena cava or OMT (n = 14). Inclusion and exclusion criteria were based on anatomical and clinical parameters. Echocardiographic measurements were performed at baseline, at the first postoperative day and one, three, and twelve months after randomization. As proof of concept of an effective sealing of the inferior vena cava, we detected a significant decrease in systolic hepatic vein reflux volume (11.0 [6.2-21.9] mL vs 3.5 [0.6-8.5] mL, P = .016) and hepatic vein diameter (11.5 [10.0-14.8] mm vs 10.0 [9.3-11.8] mm, P = .034) at thirty-day follow-up. However, CAVI had no significant impact on TR, cardiac function, and morphology. CONCLUSIONS: Caval valve implantation significantly reduced systolic reflux into the hepatic veins but was not associated with an improvement in cardiac function, morphology, or TR severity.  
Stenotic double-orifice mitral valve after surgical repaired partial atrioventricular septal defect.  ;Double-orifice mitral valve (DOMV) is an uncommon congenital anomaly account for 1% of congenital heart disease. However, accurate diagnosis and evaluation of valve stenosis or regurgitation and other concomitant congenital anomalies due to DOMV are required to obtain suitable treatment. Two- and three-dimensional echocardiography can contribute valuable functional and anatomic information that can support to reach this goal. Here, we present a case of complete bridge-type DOMV that causes mitral stenosis after surgical repair of the partial atrioventricular septal defect in childhood.  
Diagnostic value of mitral regurgitant jet volume in the assessment of mitral regurgitation severity by general imaging three-dimensional quantification.  ;Accurate quantification of mitral regurgitation (MR) severity is critical for appropriate clinical decision making regarding surgical intervention. General imaging three-dimensional quantification (GI3DQ) method allows for direct measurement of mitral regurgitant jet volume (MRJvol) with the help of three-dimensional (3D) color flow Doppler imaging. The aim of this study was to evaluate diagnostic value of MRJvol by GI3DQ for MR grading severity, using the guideline recommended integrated approach as a reference. The study included ninety-seven patients with varying degree of MR, and all MR cases were divided into central MR group (n = 44) and eccentric MR group (n = 53). The MRJvol was measured by GI3DQ. The severity of MR was graded on the basis of recommended integrated approach as mild, moderate, or severe. As assessed by receiver operating characteristic analysis, MRJvol by GI3DQ at a cutoff value of 43.4 ml yielded 76.9% of sensitivity and 86.9% of specificity to differentiate moderate from severe MR in all cases, a cutoff value of 47.5 ml yielded 98.9% of sensitivity and 94.4% of specificity to differentiate moderate from severe MR in central MR, and a cutoff value of 40.7 ml yielded 80.0% of sensitivity and 78.6% of specificity to differentiate moderate from severe MR in eccentric MR. MRJvol measured by GI3DQ could assess MR severity, especially in central MR group, which has higher sensitivity and specificity to differentiate moderate from severe MR.  
Surgical infective endocarditis and concurrent splenic abscess requiring splenectomy: a case series and review of the literature.  ;"Splenic abscess is an uncommon but serious complication of infective endocarditis (IE). The timing of surgical management of splenic abscess can be challenging when valve surgery is required. The American Heart Association (AHA) and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) currently recommends splenectomy before valve replacement due to fear of reinfection of the heart valve; however, published data to support this recommendation are limited. In this series, we report outcomes for 5 patients with IE and splenic abscess who underwent valve replacement first, followed by splenectomy at a median of 19 days (range: 10-77 days) after valve surgery, with no recurrent infection of the new valve. Our experience and review of the available literature provide reassurance for splenectomy after valve surgery for IE.  "
Cardiovascular magnetic resonance as a complementary method to transthoracic echocardiography for aortic valve area estimation in patients with aortic stenosis: A systematic review and meta-analysis.  ;BACKGROUND: Aortic stenosis (AS) is the most common valvular heart disease. While two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography (2D-TTE) is the standard imaging modality for AS assessment, cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) offers a reliable and reproducible alternative. The aim of this study was to compare AVA measurements as determined by TTE and CMR in patients with AS. METHODS: Electronic databases were searched to identify studies comparing TTE continuity equation to CMR planimetry for AVA assessment. A meta-analysis of mean difference was conducted by using the random effects model. Sensitivity analysis was performed after excluding studies reporting AVA indexed to body surface area (BSA). Heterogeneity was assessed with I2. RESULTS: A total of 12 studies, encompassing 621 patients, were included in our systematic review. In the pooled analysis, measurements of AVA by CMR planimetry were found to be significantly higher than those calculated by the continuity equation in TTE (pooled mean difference: 0.09, 95% confidence intervals (CI): 0.01, 0.17, and I2: 93%). The results remained significant, albeit with moderate heterogeneity this time, after excluding the analysis measurements of AVA indexed to BSA (pooled mean difference: 0.08, 95% CI: 0.03 to 0.13, and I2 = 61%). CONCLUSIONS: CMR planimetry slightly overestimates AVA compared to TTE continuity equation. Although, 2D-TTE should be the primary imaging modality for the estimation of AVA, CMR may be useful when there is discrepancy with the clinical assessment or when TTE results are discordant or difficult to obtain.  
Acute Kidney Injury Following Aortic Valve Replacement in Patients Without Chronic Kidney Disease.  ;"BACKGROUND: The data on acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients without chronic kidney disease (CKD) after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) are limited. The study sought to compare the incidence of AKI and its impact on 5-year mortality after TAVR and surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in patients without CKD. METHODS: This registry included data from 6463 consecutive patients who underwent TAVR or SAVR. CKD was defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min/1.73 m2. AKI was defined according to the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes criteria. For sensitivity analysis, propensity-score matching between TAVR and SAVR was performed. RESULTS: The study included 4555 consecutive patients (TAVR, n = 1215 and SAVR, n = 3340) without CKD. Propensity-score matching identified 542 pairs. Patients who underwent TAVR had a significantly lower incidence of AKI in comparison to those who underwent SAVR (unmatched 4.7% vs 16.4%, P < 0.001, multivariable analysis: odds ratio, 0.29, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.20-0.41; matched 5.9% vs 19.0%, P < 0.001). Patients with AKI had significantly increased 5-year mortality compared with those without AKI (unmatched 36.0% vs 19.1%, log-rank P < 0.001; matched 36.3% vs 24.0%, log-rank P < 0.001). The adjusted hazard ratios for 5-year mortality were 1.58 (95% CI, 1.20-2.08) for AKI grade 1, 3.27 (95% CI, 2.09-5.06) for grade 2, and 4.82 (95% CI, 2.93-8.04) for grade 3. CONCLUSIONS: TAVR in patients without CKD was associated with a significantly less frequent incidence of AKI compared with SAVR. AKI significantly increased the risk of 5-year mortality after either TAVR or SAVR, and increasing severity of AKI was incrementally associated with 5-year mortality.  "
Reoperation After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: An Analysis of the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Database.  ;"OBJECTIVES: This study sought to report the largest series of patients receiving a surgical reoperation after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) using the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) Adult Cardiac Surgery Database. BACKGROUND: TAVR has become an effective means of treating aortic stenosis. As TAVR is used in progressively lower-risk cohorts, management of device failure will become increasingly important. METHODS: The STS Adult Cardiac Surgery Database was queried for patients with a history of prior TAVR undergoing surgical aortic valve replacement from 2011 to 2015. Observed-to-expected (O/E) mortality ratios were determined to facilitate comparison across reoperative indications and timing from index TAVR procedure. RESULTS: A total of 123 patients met inclusion criteria (median age 77 years) with an STS Predicted Risk of Mortality of 4%, 4% to 8%, and >8% in 17%, 24%, and 59%, respectively. Median time to reoperation was 2.5 (interquartile range: 0.7 to 13.0) months, and the operative mortality rate was 17.1%. Common indications for reoperation included early TAVR device failures such as paravalvular leak (15%), structural prosthetic deterioration (11%), failed repair (11%), sizing or position issues (11%), and prosthetic valve endocarditis (10%). All pre-operative risk categories were associated with an increased O/E mortality ratio (Predicted Risk of Mortality <4%: O/E 5.5; 4% to 8%: O/E 1.7; >8%: O/E 1.2). CONCLUSIONS: SAVR following early failure of TAVR, while rare, is associated with worse-than-expected outcomes as compared with similar patients initially undergoing SAVR. Continued experience with this developing technology is needed to reduce the incidence of early TAVR failure and further define optimal treatment of failed TAVR prostheses.  "

Meta-analysis Comparing Outcomes of Self-Expanding Versus Balloon-Expandable Valves for Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.  ;There are two commercially available transcatheter heart valve systems: balloon expandable valves (BEV) and self-expanding valves (SEV). However, there is a paucity of randomized trials comparing both systems. Electronic databases (Medline, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and clinicaltrials.gov) and major conference proceedings were searched for randomized trials of patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis and received transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) with a SEV or BEV or surgical aortic valve replacement. The main efficacy outcomes were all-cause mortality and stroke at the longest available follow-up. The main analysis was performed using a random-effects network meta-analysis complemented by several subgroup and sensitivity analyses. Ten trials with 9,439 patients (mostly undergoing transfemoral TAVI) were included. At a median of 27 months, there was no difference between BEV and SEV valves in terms of all-cause mortality (odds ratio [OR] 1.05, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.79 to 1.42). The incidence of any stroke was higher with BEV (OR 1.51, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.26), but there was no difference in the incidence of disabling stroke. At 30-days, BEV valves were associated with lower incidence of new permanent pacemaker placement (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.79) and moderate/severe paravalvular regurgitation (OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.68). In conclusion, in patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis undergoing transfemoral TAVI, SEV and BEV were associated with similar all-cause mortality. BEV were associated with a higher incidence of any stroke driven by nondisabling strokes, but lower incidence of new permanent pacemaker placement and moderate/severe paravalvular regurgitation compared with SEV.  
Comparison of Clinical and Echocardiographic Features of Asymptomatic Patients With Stenotic Bicuspid Versus Tricuspid Aortic Valves.  ;"The clinical and imaging differences between bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) and tricuspid aortic valve (TAV) patients with medically managed asymptomatic moderate-to-severe aortic stenosis (AS) have not been studied previously. We aim to characterize these differences and their clinical outcomes in this study. A retrospective observational study was conducted on 836 consecutive cases of isolated asymptomatic moderate-to-severe AS, with median follow-up of 3.4 years. Clinical and echocardiographic characteristics were compared between BAV and TAV patients. Subgroup analysis stratified by AS severity were performed. Survival analysis of all-cause mortality was performed using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards model. Compared to BAV patients, TAV patients were older (76 ± 11 vs 55 ± 16 years, p <0.001) and had more co-morbidities including hypertension (78% vs 56%; p <0.001), diabetes (41% vs 24%; p <0.001), and chronic kidney disease (20% vs 3%; p = 0.001). TAV patients had less severe aortic valve disease than BAV patients, with a higher aortic valve area index (0.71 ± 0.20 cm2/m2 vs 0.61 ± 0.18 cm2/m2, p <0.001) and less aortic dilation (sinotubular junction: 23.7 ± 4.0 mm vs 26.9 ± 4.8 mm, p <0.001; mid-ascending aorta: 31.4 ± 4.7 mm vs 36.3 ± 6.3 mm, p <0.001). TAV patients were more likely to have eccentric left ventricular hypertrophy and less likely to have a normal geometry (p = 0.003). Competing risk analysis identified increased age (hazard ratio 1.03, 95% confidence interval 1.02 to 1.05, p <0.001) and LVEF (hazard ratio 0.98, 95% confidence interval 0.97 to 0.99, p <0.001) as independent risk factors of all-cause mortality. Valve morphology was not a significant independent risk factor for aortic valve replacement or mortality. In conclusion, asymptomatic TAV patients had more cardiovascular risk factors, less severe aortic valve disease, less sinotubular and mid-ascending aortic dilation, more severe LV remodeling.  "
Clinical outcomes in adult athletes with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: a 7-year follow-up study.  ;"OBJECTIVE: Current guidelines recommend precautionary disqualification from competitive sports in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). We assessed the incidence of cardiovascular events in a cohort of patients with HCM engaged in long-term exercise programmes and competitive sport. METHODS: We reviewed data on 88 consecutive athletes diagnosed with HCM, from 1997 to 2017; 92% male, 98% Caucasian, median age 31 (IQR: 19-44) years. All participated in regular exercise programmes and competitive sport at study entry.We performed follow-up evaluation after 7±5 (1-21) years. 61 (69%) of the athletes had substantially reduced or stopped exercise and sport (ie, HCM-detrained), and 27 had continued with regular training and sport competitions (HCM-trained). At baseline evaluation, both groups were similar for age, gender balance, symptoms, ECG abnormalities, extent of left ventricular hypertrophy, arrhythmias and risk profile for sudden cardiac death/arrest. RESULTS: During the follow-up period, two participants suffered sudden cardiac arrest or death (0.3% per year) both outside of sport participation. In addition, 19 (22%) reported symptoms (syncope in 3, palpitations in 10, chest pain in 4 and dyspnoea in 2). The Kaplan-Meier analyses of freedom from combined sudden cardiac arrest/death and symptoms (log-rank test p=0.264) showed no differences between HCM-trained and detrained patients. CONCLUSION: In this adult cohort of low-risk HCM athletes, voluntary decision to pursue in participation in competitive sport events was not associated with increased risk for major cardiac events or clinical worsening compared with decision to reduce or withdraw from exercise programmes and sport. Similar results may not be seen in younger or racially diverse athlete populations, or in patients with more severe HCM phenotypes.  "
Childhood cancer survivors: The integral role of the cardiologist and cardiovascular imaging.  ;IMPORTANCE: With 80% of childhood cancer survivors (CCS) alive 30 years after diagnosis, preventable causes of death, such as cardiovascular disease resulting from initial cancer therapy, becomes an important metric. This leads to a more pronounced role for cardiologists in the care of CCS. OBSERVATIONS: While routine cardiovascular screening has been traditionally performed by the hematologist/oncologist or primary care provider, our understanding of cardiovascular disease in CCS has advanced. The measurement of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) can now be complemented with additional assessments of strain, LV mass, right ventricular function, diastolic function, valve function, the pericardium, coronary perfusion, and biomarkers. Risk factor modification, prophylaxis, and timing of treatment are also critical. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Early cardiovascular screening and treatment in asymptomatic CCS can be nuanced and complex. As a result, there is a renewed opportunity for the cardiologist to play an integral role in the care of CCS. KEY POINTS: Question/Purpose: Review cardiovascular disease and the role of the cardiologist in the care of asymptomatic childhood cancer survivors (CCS). FINDINGS: Cardiovascular care in CCS benefits from a multi-faceted approach that does not overly rely on LVEF. Meaning: Adequate screening and treatment of cardiovascular disease in asymptomatic CCS may often be optimized by the involvement of a cardiologist.  
Predictors of Fabry disease in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: How to guide the diagnostic strategy?  ;"BACKGROUND: Fabry disease (FD) is a treatable cause of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). We aimed to determine the independent predictors of FD and to define a clinically useful strategy to discriminate FD among HCM. METHODS: Multicenter study including 780 patients with the ESC definition of HCM. FD screening was performed by enzymatic assay in males and genetic testing in females. Multivariate regression analysis identified independent predictors of FD in HCM. A discriminant function analysis defined a score based on the weighted combination of these predictors. RESULTS: FD was found in 37 of 780 patients with HCM (4.7%): 31 with p.F113L mutation due to a founder effect; and 6 with other variants (p.C94S; p.M96V; p.G183V; p.E203X; p.M290I; p.R356Q/p.G360R). FD prevalence in HCM adjusted for the founder effect was 0.9%. Symmetric HCM (OR 3.464, CI95% 1.151-10.430), basal inferolateral late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) (OR 10.677, CI95% 3.633-31.380), bifascicular block (OR 10.909, CI95% 2.377-50.059) and ST-segment depression (OR 4.401, CI95% 1.431-13.533) were independent predictors of FD in HCM. The score ID FABRY-HCM [-0.729 + (2.781xBifascicular block) + (0.590xST depression) + (0.831xSymmetric HCM) + (2.130xbasal inferolateral LGE)] had a negative predictive value of 95.8% for FD, with a cut-off of 1.0, meaning that, in the absence of both bifascicular block and basal inferolateral LGE, FD is a less probable cause of HCM, being more appropriate to perform HCM gene panel than targeted FD screening. CONCLUSION: FD prevalence in HCM was 0.9%. Bifascicular block and basal inferolateral LGE were the most powerful predictors of FD in HCM. In their absence, HCM gene panel is the most appropriate step in etiological study of HCM.  "
Multimodality imaging in bicuspid aortic valve.  ;Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) patients are at increased risk of valve dysfunction and ascending aorta aneurysm. Imaging techniques are essential to establish diagnosis, identify complications and indicate surgical treatment. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is the imaging technique of choice to diagnose BAV, valve morphotype and valvular dysfunction in clinical practice. However, it can be less precise in assessing the aortic root and proximal ascending aorta, and visualization of the mid-distal ascending aorta and the arch may be difficult in some adults where cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) and computed tomography, using multiplanar reconstructions, are better at assessing aortic diameters. Although valvular dysfunction is very variable, almost half of the patients have more than mild aortic valve disease. TTE is the most effective and accurate test for evaluating the severity of valvular dysfunction and guiding appropriate management decisions. Aorta dilation is a common finding in patients with BAV. The pattern of aortic dimensions has been categorized in three aortic phenotypes: no-dilation phenotype, ascending aorta phenotype and root phenotype. Controversial data exist regarding the relationship between BAV morphology and aorta dilation phenotype. The assessment of aortic stiffness (measuring distensibility or the velocity of propagation of flow) has raised special interest in order to predict progressive aorta dilation. However, current data indicates that BAV aortas do not show altered stiffness compared to those associated with a tricuspid valve with a similar aorta size. Moreover, novel 4D-flow CMR sequences have been crucial in the evaluation of abnormal ascending aorta flow, showing that flow in the aorta of BAV patients is asymmetric and includes the formation of large vortices. Such flow abnormalities are thought to produce changes in wall shear stress which has been associated with extracellular matrix dysregulation. The key points to understand familial screening and the recommendations for establishing the follow-up and therapeutic management of BAV patients are exposed in the review. The main objective of this article is to review the advantages and limitations of the imaging techniques in the diagnosis and management of BAV and the best strategies in the use of multimodality imaging.  
Paediatric Inflammatory Multisystem Syndrome: Temporally Associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS): Cardiac Features, Management and Short-Term Outcomes at a UK Tertiary Paediatric Hospital.  ;"Children were relatively spared during COVID-19 pandemic. However, the recently reported hyperinflammatory syndrome with overlapping features of Kawasaki disease and toxic shock syndrome-""Paediatric Inflammatory Multisystem Syndrome-temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2"" (PIMS-TS) has caused concern. We describe cardiac findings and short-term outcomes in children with PIMS-TS at a tertiary children's hospital. Single-center observational study of children with PIMS-TS from 10th April to 9th May 2020. Data on ECG and echocardiogram were retrospectively analyzed along with demographics, clinical features and blood parameters. Fifteen children with median age of 8.8 (IQR 6.4-11.2) years were included, all were from African/Afro-Caribbean, South Asian, Mixed or other minority ethnic groups. All showed raised inflammatory/cardiac markers (CRP, ferritin, Troponin I, CK and pro-BNP). Transient valve regurgitation was present in 10 patients (67%). Left Ventricular ejection fraction was reduced in 12 (80%), fractional shortening in 8 (53%) with resolution in all but 2. Fourteen (93%) had coronary artery abnormalities, with normalization in 6. ECG abnormalities were present in 9 (60%) which normalized in 6 by discharge. Ten (67%) needed inotropes and/or vasopressors. None needed extracorporeal life support. Improvement in cardiac biochemical markers was closely followed by improvement in ECG/echocardiogram. All patients were discharged alive and twelve (80%) have been reviewed since. Our entire cohort with PIMS-TS had cardiac involvement and this degree of involvement is significantly more than other published series and emphasizes the need for specialist cardiac review. We believe that our multi-disciplinary team approach was crucial for the good short-term outcomes.  "
Non-invasive prediction of tissue Doppler-derived E/e' ratio using lung Doppler signals.  ;"AIMS: Lung Doppler signals (LDS) represent the radial movement of small pulmonary blood vessel walls, caused by pulse waves of cardiac origin. We sought to investigate the accuracy and prognostic value of LDS as a predictor of mitral valve early diastolic flow to annular velocity ratio (E/e'), in patients with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF). METHODS AND RESULTS: We prospectively enrolled patients with ADHF (n = 99, mean age 65 ± 15 years, 61% males) who underwent echocardiographic and simultaneous LDS evaluation at hospital admission. Patients with hospital stay over 72 h underwent a repeat echocardiogram and LDS assessment before discharge. Patients were followed for the occurrence of short-term all-cause mortality and heart failure (HF) hospitalization. Predicted E/e' from LDS correlated with echocardiographic E/e' at admission and discharge (r = 0.67 and 0.83; P < 0.001 for both), respectively. Patients were dichotomized into two groups by the median predicted-E/e'. A high predicted-E/e' was associated with age, hypertension, anaemia, history of HF with preserved ejection fraction (EF), and chronic kidney disease. Over a median follow-up period of 7 months, 22 (22.2%) patients died and 23 (23.2%) patients were rehospitalized for HF. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a significantly lower event-free survival in high predicted-E/e' group HF patients with reduced EF (P = 0.0247). No significant differences were observed in HF rehospitalization rates between the two groups. CONCLUSION: In this single-centre prospective study of patients with ADHF, LDS predicted echocardiographic E/e' measurements and showed prognostic value in predicting all-cause mortality in HF patients with a reduced EF.

Aortic Valve Regurgitation: Pathophysiology and Implications for Surgical Intervention in the Era of TAVR.  ;Aortic insufficiency (AI) or regurgitation is caused by the malcoaptation of the aortic valve (AV) cusps due to intrinsic abnormalities of the valve itself, a dilatation or geometric distortion of the aortic root, or by some combination thereof. In recent years, there has been an increase in the number of studies suggesting that AI is an active disease process caused by a combination of factors including but not limited to alteration of specific molecular pathways, genetic predisposition, and changes in the mechanotransductive properties of the AV apparatus. As the surgical management of AV disease continues to evolve, increasingly sophisticated surgical and percutaneous techniques for AV repair and replacement, including transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), have become more commonplace and will likely continue to expand as new devices are introduced. However, these techniques necessitate frequent reappraisal of the biological and mechanobiological mechanisms underlying AV regurgitation to better understand the risk factors for AI development and recurrence following surgical intervention as well as expand our limited knowledge on patient selection for such procedures. The aim of this review is to describe some of the putative mechanisms implicated in the development of AI, dissect some of the cross-talk among known and possible signaling pathways leading to valve remodeling, identify association between these pathways and pharmacological approaches, and discuss the implications for surgical and percutaneous approaches to AV repair in replacement in the TAVR era.  
Primary repair of transposition of the great arteries with an interrupted aortic arch: a case report and literature review.  ;Transposition of the great arteries (TGA) and interruption of the aortic arch (IAA) are uncommon congenital heart diseases. The association between TGA and IAA is rare. The aim of this study is to present a case with combined TGA and IAA, who underwent the primary repair and review the literature with similar cases. The one-month-old patient was admitted with tachypnea and cyanosis. Delayed diagnosis was caused due to the absence of prenatal examination. Echocardiography and computed tomography angiography confirmed TGA with anterior-posterior-oriented great arteries, wide patent ductus arteriosus, type B IAA, ventricular septal defect (VSD) and pulmonary arterial hypertension. The patient underwent a single-stage primary surgical repair process leading to VSD closure, reconstruction of the aortic arch and arterial switch operation in October 2019. The patient is doing well at a 3-month follow-up post-surgery. The echocardiogram suggests a normal systolic function of the ventricles and trivial regurgitation for both aortic and pulmonary valves. CONCLUSIONS: The single-stage repair with VSD closure, reconstruction of aortic arch and arterial switch operation might be an applicable approach for most of the patients with combined TGA and IAA. Long term follow-up is required as a high re-intervention rate for recurrent coarctation, supravalvular aortic stenosis, neoaortic valve regurgitation, obstruction of the right heart system and coronary stenosis has been reported.  
Characteristics of Children with Acute Rheumatic Carditis from a High-Incidence Region: Importance of Unexplained Worsening of Functional Class.  ;"BACKGROUND: Acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and acute rheumatic carditis (ARC) continue to be a major public health problem in developing countries. OBJECTIVE: To study the characteristics of children with ARC being treated at a tertiary centre. METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied 126 children (mean age 10.4 ± 2.3 years, range 5-15 years, 60% males) diagnosed with ARC by treating cardiologists. Most had lower socio-economic status. Fifty of 126 (40%) presented with a first episode of ARC. Joint symptoms were present in 29% and fever in 25%. Only 2.4% had subcutaneous nodules and none had erythema marginatum or chorea. Fifty-one percent presented in NYHA class II and 29% in NYHA class III or IV. Tachycardia and heart failure were present in 53% and 21%, respectively. Recent worsening of NYHA class (dyspnoea) was the commonest feature (48%). Laboratory investigations showed raised antistreptolysin O titres (>333 units) in only 36.7% of patients. Raised C-reactive protein (CRP) was present in 70%, while raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate was found in only 37% of patients. On the basis of above findings, the modified Jones criteria (2015) for the diagnosis of ARF were satisfied only in 46% of children. Echocardiography showed mitral valve thickening in 77% and small nodules on the tip of the leaflets in 43% (27 and 8%, respectively for aortic valve). Left ventricular ejection fraction was <50% in only 3 patients. The dominant valve lesion was mitral regurgitation (MR) (present in 95% of patients; severe in 78%, moderate in 15%), while aortic regurgitation was present in 44% (severe in 14%). CONCLUSIONS: The criteria are often not satisfied by patients being treated for ARC. Recent unexplained worsening of dyspnoea, young age, significant MR, echocardiographic nodules, and elevated CRP are important indicators.  "
A novel recyclable left ventricular partitioning device.  ;Percutaneous ventricular restoration is an established treatment that is used in left ventricle (LV) patients with anteroapical regional wall motion abnormality, dilated LV, systolic dysfunction after anterior myocardial infarction, and poor LV ejection fraction of heart failure. A ventricular partitioning device (VPD), which can be delivered percutaneously through the aortic valve, was placed at the apex of the LV. We aimed at improving the LV hemodynamics by isolating the dysfunctional apical region. Existing VPDs used in clinics are not recyclable. If the physician must extract the device owing to disease development, the patient must undergo thoracotomy. It is well known that thoracotomy is a high-risk operation. It may even cause patients to die. Therefore, we propose a recyclable left VPD that can be remove through a recovery snare after the device is implanted into the patient's ventricle. Such novel recyclable VPD could effectively avoid thoracotomy, thus resulting in favorable outcomes with reassuring safety.  
Lipoprotein(a) and calcific aortic valve stenosis: A systematic review.  ;Calcific aortic valve stenosis (AS) is the most common form of acquired valvular heart disease needing intervention and our understanding of this disease has evolved from one of degenerative calcification to that of an active process driven by the interplay of genetic factors and chronic inflammation modulated by risk factors such as smoking, hypertension and elevated cholesterol. Lipoprotein(a) [Lp (a)] is a cholesterol rich particle secreted by the liver which functions as the major lipoprotein carrier of phosphocholine-containing oxidized phospholipids. Lp(a) levels are largely genetically determined by polymorphisms in the LPA gene. While there is an extensive body of evidence linking Lp(a) to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, emerging evidence now suggests a similar association of Lp(a) to calcific AS. In this article, we performed a systematic review of all published literature to assess the association between Lp(a) and calcific aortic valve (AV) disease. In addition, we review the potential mechanisms by which Lp(a) influences the progression of valve disease. Our review identified a total of 21 studies, varying from case-control studies, prospective or retrospective observational cohort studies to Mendelian randomized studies that assessed the association between Lp(a) and calcific AS. All but one of the above studies demonstrated significant association between elevated Lp(a) and calcific AS. We conclude that there is convincing evidence supporting a causal association between elevated Lp(a) and calcific AS. In addition, elevated Lp(a) predicts a faster hemodynamic progression of AS, and increased risk of AV replacement, especially in younger patients. Further research into the clinical utility of Lp(a) as a marker for predicting the incidence, progression, and outcomes of sclerodegenerative AV disease is needed.  
Long-term outcome and quality of life after biological aortic valve replacement in non-elderly adults.  ;BACKGROUND: Aortic valve replacement (AVR) is a standard of care in the treatment of aortic valve stenosis (AS). The aim of the study was to evaluate the long-term outcome and quality of life (QoL) after biological AVR in patients younger than 60 years. METHODS: 354 consecutive patients ≤ 60 years who underwent biological AVR at our institution (2005-2015) were included. Primary endpoint was actual freedom from aortic valve (AV) re-intervention, secondary endpoints were actual freedom from major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) as well as mental and physical QoL. RESULTS: Mean age was 52.3±7.1 years and mean follow-up duration was 78.7±38.1 months. Overall survival at 5, 10 and 12 years was 87.6%, 76.3% and 63.5% and actual freedom from AV re-intervention was 85.5%, 67.8% and 52.9%. Actual freedom from MACCE was 82.8%, 63.2% and 50.4%, respectively. Cox regression revealed concomitant coronary artery disease (p<0.001) and creatinine at baseline (p<0.001) as independent predictors of survival, AV re-intervention and MACCE. Physical QoL was similar (p=0.427) and mental QoL (p=0.005) was significantly better compared to the published age-matched controls. CONCLUSIONS: Biological AVR in ≤ 60 years old patients is associated with a significant occurrence of actual AV re-intervention and MACCE at 10 to 12 years. Mental QoL after biological AVR was superior compared to healthy controls. The effect of the most recently developed bioprosthesis, specifically for younger patients, needs to be evaluated. Therefore, a shared decision -making process in prosthetic aortic valve selection is mandatory in AVR patients ≤ 60 years.

Three-Year Outcomes From the Harmony Native Outflow Tract Early Feasibility Study.  ;"BACKGROUND: The Harmony transcatheter pulmonary valve (TPV) was designed for treatment of postoperative pulmonary valve regurgitation in patients with repaired right ventricular outflow tracts. METHODS: The Native TPV EFS (Early Feasibility Study) is a prospective, multicenter, nonrandomized feasibility study. Three-year outcomes are reported. RESULTS: Of 20 implanted patients, 17 completed 3-year follow-up (maximum: 4.1 years). There were no deaths and 2 early explants. One patient did not complete the 3-year visit. In patients with available 3-year echocardiographic data, 1 had a mild paravalvular leak and the rest had none/trace; 1 patient had mild pulmonary valve regurgitation and the remainder had none/trace. The 3-year mean right ventricular outflow tract echocardiographic gradient was 15.7±5.5 mm Hg. Radiographically, no late frame fractures or erosions were identified. At 2 years, 2 patients presented with an increased echocardiographic outflow gradient (1 mixed lesion with moderate/severe pulmonary valve regurgitation). Computed tomography scans identified neointimal tissue ingrowth within the stent frame in both patients, and they were treated successfully with a transcatheter valve-in-valve procedure (Melody TPV). Additional follow-up computed tomography scans performed at 3.2±0.5 years after implant were obtained in 16 patients and revealed luminal tissue thickening at the inflow and outflow portion of the frame with no significant alteration of the valve housing. CONCLUSIONS: Three-year results from the Native TPV EFS revealed stable Harmony TPV device position, good valve function in most, and the absence of moderate/severe paravalvular leak and significant late frame fractures. Two patients developed significant neointimal proliferation requiring valve-in-valve treatment, while all others had no clinically significant right ventricular outflow tract obstruction.

HAS-BLED score and actual bleeding in elderly patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation.  ;BACKGROUND: The optimal antithrombotic therapy after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is unsettled. Short and longer-term thromboembolic and bleeding risk post TAVI remain high. Non-vitamin K oral anticoagulant drugs (NOAC) may be attractive after TAVI but the implications of prolonged NOAC in this setting require further research. The aim of this study was to assess the HAS-BLED bleeding risk in a contemporary TAVI population and explore its correlation with the effective bleeding complications with or without (N)OAC. METHODS: This study included 986 consecutive successful TAVI patients from 2 tertiary care facilities. Statistical analysis consisted of Cox regression. Bleedings were classified according to VARC-2 criteria. RESULTS: Mean age was 80.5 years, mean STS was 4.7 and 54% were males. A total of 483 patients (49.2%) had AF and 42.1% were on (N)OAC. The median HAS-BLED score was 2, 42.6% had a HAS-BLED≥3. Overall 216 patients (21.9%) experienced at least 1 bleeding, 166 (16.9%) occurred early after TAVI. HAS-BLED≥3 was an independent predictor of overall and pre-discharge bleeding (respectively HR 1.347 CI 1.029-1.763, P=0.03: HR 1.403 CI 1.032-1.905, P=0.05). The incidence of bleeding was similar in patient on (N)OAC vs. patients not on (N)OAC, both in the low and high HAS-BLED cohorts (P=0.93, P=0.42 respectively). Cardiovascular mortality was significantly higher in the high HAS-BLED cohort (37.5% vs. 24%, P=0.04) and HAS-BLED≥3 was an independent predictor of late mortality (HR 1.452 CI 1.028-2.053, P=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: In our series, contemporary TAVI patients had an elevated HAS-BLED score. The HAS-BLED score correlated with early bleedings and mortality after TAVI. Use of (N)OAC was not associated with more bleedings after TAVI.  
Lipoprotein(a): Expanding our knowledge of aortic valve narrowing.  ;Elevated levels of lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] have been identified as an independent and causal risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and, more recently, calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD). CAVD is a slow, progressive disorder presenting as severe trileaflet calcification known as aortic valve stenosis (AS) that impairs valve motion and restricts ventricular outflow. AS afflicts 2% of the aging population (≥ 65 years) and tends to be quite advanced by the time it presents clinical symptoms of exertional angina, syncope, or heart failure. Currently, the only effective clinical therapy for AS patients is surgical or transcatheter aortic valve replacement. Evidence is accumulating that Lp(a) can exacerbate pathophysiological processes in CAVD, specifically, endothelial dysfunction, formation of foam cells, and promotion of a pro-inflammatory state. In the valve milieu, the pro-inflammatory effects of Lp(a) are manifested in valve thickening and mineralization through pro-osteogenic signaling and changes in gene expression in valve interstitial cells that is primarily facilitated by the oxidized phospholipid content of Lp(a). In AS pathogenesis, an incomplete understanding of the role of Lp(a) at the molecular level and the absence of appropriate animal models are barriers for the development of specific and effective clinical interventions designed to mitigate the role of Lp(a) in AS. However, the advent of effective therapies that dramatically lower Lp(a) provides the possibility of the first medical treatment to halt AS progression.  
Results of Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting Alone Versus Combined Surgical Revascularization and Mitral Repair In Patients with Moderate Ischemic Mitral Regurgitation.  ;"BACKGROUND: This is a prospective randomized-controlled study done to evaluate the best surgical option for moderate ischemic mitral regurgitation through either coronary artery bypass grafting only or by performing additional mitral repair. METHODS: Over a nine-month period, 60 patients with ischemic heart disease associated with moderate ischemic mitral regurgitation were equally divided into two groups. Group 1 included 30 patients who had coronary artery bypass grafting with mitral valve repair; Group 2 included 30 patients who had only coronary artery bypass grafting. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the study groups, regarding operative data, apart from the cardiopulmonary bypass time and aortic cross-clamp time, which were significantly longer in group 1 (P < 0.001). Only one patient died in group 1 due to severe myocardial dysfunction. During the follow up, the NYHA class improved in group 1, from 2.7 to 1.35 (P < 0.004), compared with group 2, where the NYHA class improved from 2.6 to 1.72 (P = 0.07). The degree of MR improved in 28 patients (93%) in group 1 and 22 patients (73%) in group 2 (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: The study revealed many advantages of adding mitral repair to surgical revascularization in patients with moderate ischemic mitral regurgitation, with improvement in the degree of MR and NYHA functional class. On the other hand there were no significant differences between the groups, regarding the postoperative course and incidence of mortality.  "
Screening for rheumatic heart disease: The reliability of anterior mitral valve leaflet thickness measurement.  ;BACKGROUND: Studies determining the reliability of the World Heart Federation (WHF) anterior mitral valve leaflet (AMVL) measurement are limited by the introduction of bias in their test-retest analyses. This study sought to determine the reliability of the current AMVL measurement while controlling for systematic bias. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of echocardiographic data from 16 patients with previous acute rheumatic fever was performed. Included in this study was an optimized cine loop of the mitral valve (MV) [reader-optimized measurement (ROM]) in the parasternal long-axis view and an optimized still image of the MV obtained from the same cine loop [specialist-optimized image (SOI)]. Each still image and associated cine loop was quadruplicated and randomized to determine intra- and inter-rater agreement and quantify the impact of zoom on AMVL measurement. RESULTS: Specialist-optimized image without zoom reflected the highest degree of agreement in both cohorts with an ICC of 0.29 and 0.46. The agreement in ROM images without zoom was ICC of 0.23 and 0.45. The addition of zoom to SOI decreased agreement further to an ICC of 0.20 and 0.36. The setting associated with the poorest agreement profile was ROI with zoom with an ICC of 0.13 and 0.34, respectively. The intra-rater agreement between readers in both cohorts was moderate across all settings with an ICC ranging between 0.64 and 0.86. CONCLUSIONS: The WHF AMVL measurement is only moderately repeatable within readers and demonstrates poor reproducibility that was not improved by the addition of a zoom-optimized protocol. Given our study findings, we cannot advocate the current WHF AMVL measurement as a reliable assessment for RHD.  
Management of Structural Heart Disease and Acute Coronary Syndromes in the COVID-19 Pandemic.  ;Transcatheter interventions for structural heart disease (SHD) now represent an effective alternative to surgery in selected patients. A clear premise is that delay in or neglect of treating patients in need of SHD intervention is associated with unavoidable morbidity and mortality because many of them have life-threatening conditions. However, the recent outbreak of coronavirus-associated disease-2019 (COVID-19) is placing an unprecedented strain on patients, physicians and world healthcare systems that resulted in deferral of elective and semi-elective procedures, such as SHD, and delay in the treatment of patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). We hereby present the case for a focused resumption of transcatheter SHD interventions in selected centers, in order to preserve patient safety and avoid that death rate will extend far beyond that directly associated with COVID-19. A similar approach should be applied to the invasive management of ACS. Indeed, a proactive and vigilant stance on managing SHD and ACS is crucial, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, when the risk of overlooking severely sick patients or postponing life-saving treatments is high. If such corrective measures are not put into effect, we may expect in the near future an excess of avoidable fatalities indirectly due to COVID-19 but truly caused by cardiovascular diseases, as well as an exceedingly large number of patients with severe heart failure leading to shorter life expectancy, reduced quality of life and increased healthcare cost.

Infective endocarditis at a tertiary-care hospital in China.  ;BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to describe the clinical features and outcome of infective endocarditis at a general hospital in China and to identify the risk factors associated with in-hospital mortality. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted and all patients diagnosed with definite or possible infective endocarditis between January 2013 and June 2018 according to the modified Duke criteria were included. RESULTS: A total of 381 patients were included. The mean age was 46 years old and 66.9% patients were male patients. Community acquired IE was the most common type of infective endocarditis and Viridans Group Streptococci (37.5%) was still the most common causative pathogen. The microbial etiology of infective endocarditis varied with location of acquisition. 97 (25.5%) patients had culture-negative infective endocarditis. Vegetations were detected in 85% patients and mitral valve was the most common involved valve. Operations were performed in 72.7% patients and in-hospital mortality rate was 8.4%. The risk factors of in-hospital mortality were age old than 70 years old, heart failure, stroke and medical therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Older age, heart failure, stroke and medical therapy were risk factors of in-hospital mortality. Infective endocarditis, were mainly caused by Viridans Group Streptococci, characterized by younger patients and lower mortality rate in China.  
Prognostic implications of baseline 6-min walk test performance in intermediate risk patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement.  ;"BACKGROUND: While slow gait speed is known to be associated with poor outcomes in patients at high surgical risk who undergo transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), the prognostic significance of slow gait speed in intermediate risk TAVR patients is poorly understood. OBJECTIVES: We assessed the association between baseline 6-min walk test (6MWT) performance and both 2-year mortality and health status in intermediate risk patients undergoing TAVR as a part of the PARTNER II/S3i studies. METHODS: The association of baseline 6MWT with mortality over 2-years after TAVR was examined using Cox regression; both unadjusted and adjusted for age, left ventricular ejection fraction, coronary artery disease, pulmonary disease, renal insufficiency, and STS score. Patients were divided into four groups according to baseline 6MWT: unable to walk and in three equal tertiles of slow, medium, and fast walkers. Among surviving patients, improvement in 6MWT and quality of life were compared. RESULTS: Among 2,037 intermediate risk TAVR patients (mean age 81.7 years, STS score 5.6%), 8.2% were unable to walk. Baseline 6MWT was associated with all-cause mortality over 2 years (Hazard ratio (HR) 0.87 per 50 m, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.83 to 0.92, p < .0001). Among surviving patients, the adjusted absolute change in 6MWT at 2 years improved for patients unable to walk (+134.1 m, 95% CI 102.1 to 166 m, p < .0001) and slow walkers (+60.5 m, 95% CI 42.8 to 78.2 m, p < .0001), but was unchanged for medium walkers (-7.3 m, 95% CI -24.3 to 9.6 m, p = .4), and declined for fast walkers (-41.3 m, 95% CI -58.7 to -23.9 m, p < .0001). CONCLUSION: Poor functional capacity is predictive of 2-year mortality in elderly intermediate risk patients undergoing TAVR. However, surviving patients with poor baseline functional capacity had significant improvement in 6MWT performance and quality of life at 2-years following TAVR.  "
Heart Valve Endocarditis.  ;Heart valve replacement is the most common cardiac surgical operation performed worldwide for infective endocarditis (IE). Long-term durability and avoidance of infection relapse are the goals of the procedure. However, no detailed guidelines on prosthesis selection and surgical strategies are available, which should be guided by a comprehensive evaluation of the extent of the infection and its microbiological characteristics, the clinical profile of the patient and the risk of infection recurrence. Conventional mechanical or stented xenografts are the preferred choice for localized heart infection. In cases of complex IE with involvement of the root or the aorto-mitral continuity, the use of homograft is suggested according to the surgeon's and center's experience. The use of homograft needs to be balanced against the risk of structural degeneration. Prosthetic bioroot and prosthetic valved conduit with a mechanical or bioprosthetic valve are also considered acceptable alternatives in patients with aortic valve endocarditis. The further development of preservation techniques to enable the longer durability of allogeneic substitutes is required. We discuss current evidence for the use of valve substitutes in heart valve endocarditis and propose an evidence-based algorithm for the choice of treatment.  
CT imaging prior to transcatheter aortic valve implantation in the UK.  ;OBJECTIVE: This cross-sectional observational study sought to describe variations in CT in the context of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (CT-TAVI) as currently performed in the UK. METHODS: 408 members of the British Society of Cardiovascular Imaging were invited to complete a 27-item online CT-TAVI survey. RESULTS: 47 responses (12% response rate) were received from 40 cardiac centres, 23 (58%) of which performed TAVI on-site (TAVI centres). Only six respondents (13%) performed high-volume activity (>200 scans per year) compared with 13 (28%) performing moderate (100-200 scans per year) and 27 (59%) performing low (0-99 scans per year) volume activity. Acquisition protocols varied (41% retrospective, 12% prospective with wide padding, 47% prospective with narrow padding), as did the phase of reporting (45% systolic, 37% diastolic, 11% both, 6% unreported). Median dose length product was 675 mGy.cm (IQR 477-954 mGy.cm). Compared with non-TAVI centres, TAVI centres were more likely to report minimum iliofemoral luminal diameter (n=25, 96% vs n=7, 58%, p=0.003) and optimal tube angulation for intervention (n=12, 46% vs n=1, 8%, p=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: This national survey formally describes current CT-TAVI practice in the UK. High-volume activity was only present at one in seven cardiac CT centres. There is wide variation in scan acquisition, scan reporting and radiation dose exposure in cardiac CT centres.  
Assessment of exercise-induced changes in von Willebrand factor as a marker of severity of aortic stenosis.  ;BACKGROUND: Loss of high-molecular-weight multimers (HMWMs) of von Willebrand factor (vWF) occurs due to high shear stress in patients with aortic stenosis. As symptoms of aortic stenosis occur during exercise, measurement of vWF during exercise might identify patients with aortic stenosis of clinical importance. The aim of this pilot study is to evaluate whether vWF changes over time as a result of exercise in patients with asymptomatic moderate or severe aortic stenosis. METHODS: Ten subjects were analysed for changes in vWF by measuring HMWMs and closure time with adenosine diphosphate (CT-ADP). All subjects underwent a full stress test on a bicycle ergometer. At rest and at peak exercise, a transthoracic echocardiogram was performed. HMWMs and CT-ADP were assessed at baseline, during and after exercise. RESULTS: HMWMs and CT-ADP did not change significantly during exercise, p=0.45 and p=0.65, respectively. HMWMs and CT-ADP correlated well, Spearman's rho -0.621, p<0.001. HMWMs during peak exercise did not correlate with maximal velocity measured, p=0.21. CT-ADP during exercise correlated well with the maximal echocardiographic velocity over the aortic valve (AV), rho 0.82, p=0.04. CONCLUSIONS: In a cohort of 10 patients with moderate or severe aortic stenosis, we observed no significant change in vWF biomarkers during exercise. Peak CT-ADP during exercise showed a good correlation with peak AV velocity measured with echo. Although CT-ADP is an easy test to perform and could be an alternative for peak AV velocity measured during exercise, our results suggest that it can only detect large changes in shear stress.  
Insights on Embolic Protection, Repositioning, and Stroke: A Subanalysis of the RESPOND Study.  ;"RESPOND is a prospective, single-arm study enrolling 1014 transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) patients. The objective of this analysis is to assess the impact of cerebral embolic protection (CEP) devices and prosthetic valve repositioning on the risk of neurologic complications in patients treated with the fully repositionable Lotus Valve in the RESPOND postmarket study. Valve repositioning and CEP use were at the operators' discretion. Stroke events were adjudicated by an independent medical reviewer. This analysis assessed the baseline differences among patients according to CEP use and valve repositioning and evaluated the neurological complications at 72 hours after TAVR, hospital discharge, and 30-day follow-up. A multivariate analysis was performed to identify the potential predictors of stroke. Of the 996 patients implanted with the Lotus Valve (mean age: 80.8 years, 50.8% female, STS score 6.0 ± 6.9), 92 cases (9.2%) used CEP. The overall rate of acute stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA) was 3.0% at 72 hours after TAVR. The 72-hour stroke/TIA rate was 1.1% in patients who had CEP and 3.2% in those who did not. Use of CEP was associated with a 2.1% absolute reduction in the risk of acute neurological events (relative risk reduction: 65.6%), although the difference was not statistically significant (p=0.51). Repositioning of the Lotus Valve occurred in 313/996 procedures (31.4%). The 72-hour rate of stroke/TIA was similar in patients who had valve repositioning (2.9%) compared with those who did not (3.1%; p=0.86). The selective use of a CEP device in the RESPOND study was associated with a nonsignificantly lower risk for stroke within 72 hours. The use of the repositioning feature of the Lotus Valve did not increase the stroke risk.  "
Cardiac involvement in classical or hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is uncommon.  ;PURPOSE: Cardiac-valvular and vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) have significant cardiovascular issues. The prevalence and significance of such abnormalities in classical (cEDS) or hypermobile EDS (hEDS) remain unclear. We report the prevalence of cardiac abnormalities in patients with cEDS and hEDS. METHODS: We identified 532 pediatric patients with potential EDS evaluated at our institution from January 2014 through April 2019 by retrospective chart review. Ninety-five patients (12 cEDS and 83 hEDS patients) met 2017 EDS diagnostic criteria and had an echocardiogram. One patient was excluded due to complex congenital heart disease, and two were excluded due to lack of images. We reviewed echocardiograms for all structural abnormalities. RESULTS: Of these 95 patients, 1 had mild aortic root dilation, and 1 had mild ascending aorta dilation in the setting of a bicuspid aortic valve. Eleven patients (11.6%) had a cardiac valve abnormality, all of which were trivial to mild. None of the patients required cardiac intervention. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that aortic dilation and valvular anomalies are uncommon in cEDS or hEDS patients. Given the lack of evidence, we do not recommend echocardiographic evaluation and surveillance in patients with cEDS and hEDS in the absence of clinical findings or positive family history.  
Echocardiography-guided subxiphoidal transapical TAVR in a challenging anatomy: a case report.  ;BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) via an antegrade transapical access (TA-TAVR) is largely reserved to cases not amenable to transfemoral TAVR. Challenges resulting from unusual thoracic anatomies may require special considerations in terms of the surgical access. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case of TA-TAVR through a subxiphoidal approach in a patient who had undergone extensive thoracic surgery 8 years previously. CONCLUSION: Our case demonstrates that unusual anatomic features should not discourage from TA-TAVR but may require unusual approaches designed on a case-to-case basis following careful interdisciplinary preparation and planning including adequate pre-operative diagnostics and imaging.  
The role of stress concentration in calcified bicuspid aortic valve.  ;"Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is the most common valvular heart disease in the aging population, and is now believed to be a slow, progressive, yet actively regulated process. The disease progression can be divided into two phases: initiation phase associated with lipid deposition and inflammation response, and the later propagation phase with active calcification growth. It has been hypothesized that elevated mechanical stress plays a major role in both phases of disease progression. In order to identify a direct link between leaflet stress and calcification development, we performed patient-specific finite-element (FE) analyses of six bicuspid aortic valves (BAV), where the leaflets, raphe and calcifications were all considered. The results showed that during the initiation phase, calcium buildup is likely to occur along the leaflet-root attachment curve (ATC), and the commissures, which are subject to the most drastic changes in stress during the cardiac cycle. During the propagation phase, the presence of calcification would lead to local stress concentration along its boundary, hence further calcification growth. Three patterns of calcification formation were identified on BAV leaflets: 'radial', which extended radially from ATC into the leaflet belly region; 'commissure to commissure', which extended circumferentially along the coaptation; and 'raphe', which located in the vicinity of the raphe. Furthermore, we found a strong correlation between regions with a high risk of calcium buildup and regions with elevated mechanical stress. The high-risk regions predicted at diastole on the non-calcified leaflet from FE models agreed reasonably well with the in vivo calcification locations, which indicates that patient-specific FE modelling could help us to evaluate the potential risk of calcification formation in the early stage of CAVD.

In-hospital day-by-day systolic blood pressure variability during rehabilitation: a marker of adverse outcome in secondary prevention after myocardial revascularization.  ;OBJECTIVE: Although it is known that increased visit-to-visit or home day-by-day variability of blood pressure (BP), independently of its average value, results in an increased risk of cardiovascular events, the prognostic value of in-hospital day-by-day BP variability in secondary cardiovascular prevention has not yet been established. METHODS: We studied 1440 consecutive cardiac patients during a cardiovascular rehabilitation program of about 12 days after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and/or valve surgery. We measured auscultatory BP at the patient bed in each rehabilitation day twice, in the morning and the afternoon. We correlated SBP variability assessed as standard deviation (SBP-SD) and coefficient of variation (SBP-CoV) of the daily measures with overall mortality, cardiovascular mortality and major adverse cardiocerebrovascular events (MACCEs) after a mean follow-up of 49 months by Cox hazard analysis. RESULTS: In our patients (age 68 ± 11years, 61% hypertensive patients) the ranges of SBP-SD tertiles were: 4.1-9.1, 9.2-11.5 and 11.6-24.5 mmHg. Fifty-five percent of the patients underwent CABG, 33% underwent valve surgery, 12% both CABG and valve surgery. In CABG patients, the highest SBP-SD tertile showed the highest overall mortality, cardiovascular mortality and MACCEs (P < 0.01). Results remained significant after multivariate analysis adjusting for age, sex, mean SBP, BMI, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, and diabetes. No association between SBP-SD and mortality or MACCEs was found in valve surgery patients. CONCLUSION: In-hospital day-by-day SBP variability predicts mortality and MACCEs in CABG patients, possibly representing a target during rehabilitation and treatment in secondary cardiovascular prevention.  
Circulating extracellular vesicles from patients with valvular heart disease induce neutrophil chemotaxis via FOXO3a and the inhibiting role of dexmedetomidine.  ;"We previously demonstrated that circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs) from patients with valvular heart disease (VHD; vEVs) contain inflammatory components and inhibit endothelium-dependent vasodilation. Neutrophil chemotaxis plays a key role in renal dysfunction, and dexmedetomidine (DEX) can reduce renal dysfunction in cardiac surgery. However, the roles of vEVs in neutrophil chemotaxis and effects of DEX on vEVs are unknown. Here, we investigated the impact of vEVs on neutrophil chemotaxis in kidneys and the influence of DEX on vEVs. Circulating EVs were isolated from healthy subjects and patients with VHD. The effects of EVs on chemokine generation, forkhead box protein O3a (FOXO3a) pathway activation and neutrophil chemotaxis on cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and kidneys in mice and the influence of DEX on EVs were detected. vEVs increased FOXO3a expression, decreased phosphorylation of Akt and FOXO3a, promoted FOXO3a nuclear translocation, and activated the FOXO3a signaling pathway in vitro. DEX pretreatment reduced vEV-induced CXCL4 and CCL5 expression and neutrophil chemotaxis in cultured HUVECs via the FOXO3a signaling pathway. vEVs were also found to suppress Akt phosphorylation and activate FOXO3a signaling to increase plasma levels of CXCL4 and CCL5 and neutrophil accumulation in kidney. The overall mechanism was inhibited in vivo with DEX pretreatment. Our data demonstrated that vEVs induced CXCL4-CCL5 to stimulate neutrophil infiltration in kidney, which can be inhibited by DEX via the FOXO3a signaling. Our findings reveal a unique mechanism involving vEVs in inducing neutrophils chemotaxis and may provide a novel basis for using DEX in reducing renal dysfunction in valvular heart surgery.  "
[Effectiveness of the Cox Maze-IV Procedure in Cardiac Surgery Patients With Atrial Fibrillation].  ;Aim Analyzing a 5-year experience of surgical treatment of cardiosurgical patients with atrial fibrillation (AF).Material and methods The study analyzed results of surgical treatment with extracorporeal circulation in 132 patients with AF who underwent the Maze-IV procedure using a radiofrequency ablator with transmurality feedback from 2013 through 2018.Results Two fatal outcomes were observed in the study group. These outcomes took place in the early postoperative period and were associated with progressive acute heart failure in patients with repeated surgery for mitral valve restenosis. 61.2% of the patients had no AF. Recurrent AF was observed during the first three years after surgery in association with withdrawal of the antiarrhythmic medication, which confirmed a need for long-term antiarrhythmic therapy. Analysis of risk factors for AF relapse identified significant predictors, including left ventricular dilatation larger than 5.5 cm at baseline and more than two-year duration of a history of arrhythmias.Conclusion The Maze-IV procedure proved an effective and safe method of surgical treatment in AF patients with acquired heart defects and ischemic heart disease, which allowed maintaining sinus rhythm in 61.2% of patients for 5 years. Preventive amiodarone saturation reduced the risk of AF relapse by 24.2 % (p=0.038) and incidence of postoperative arrhythmic complications by 34.9 % (p=0.008) in cardiosurgical patients.  
Coronavirus Disease 2019 Catheterization Laboratory Survey.  ;"Background The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic is expected to affect operations and lifestyles of interventional cardiologists around the world in unprecedented ways. Timely gathering of information on this topic can provide valuable insight and improve the handling of the ongoing and future pandemic outbreaks. Methods and Results A survey instrument developed by the authors was disseminated via e-mail, text messaging, WhatsApp, and social media to interventional cardiologists between April 6, 2020, and April 11, 2020. A total of 509 responses were collected from 18 countries, mainly from the United States (51%) and Italy (36%). Operators reported significant decline in coronary, structural heart, and endovascular procedure volumes. Personal protective equipment was available to 95% of respondents; however FIT-tested N95 or equivalent masks were available to only 70%, and 74% indicated absence of coronavirus disease 2019 pretesting. Most (83%) operators expressed concern when asked to perform cardiac catheterization on a suspected or confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 patient, primarily because of fear of viral transmission (88%). Although the survey demonstrated significant compliance with social distancing, high use of telemedicine (69%), and online education platforms (80%), there was concern over impending financial loss. Conclusions Our survey indicates significant reduction in invasive procedure volumes and concern for viral transmission. There is near universal adoption of personal protective equipment; however, coronavirus disease 2019 pretesting and access to FIT-tested N95 masks is suboptimal. Although there is concern over impending financial loss, substantial engagement in telemedicine and online education is reported.  "
Contemporary trends in mitral valve surgery in East China: a 10-year experience.  ;BACKGROUND: Contemporary nationwide data from mainland China on trends in mitral valve surgery are scarce. The purpose of the present study was to review a single-center experience with mitral valve surgery over a 10-year period in East China. METHODS: Between July 2009 and June 2019, 3238 consecutive patients who underwent mitral valve surgery in our center were retrospectively reviewed. The patients were evenly divided into three periods: July 2009 to October 2012 (period I), November 2012 to February 2016 (period II), March 2016 to June 2019 (period III). RESULTS: The 3238 patients included 536 (16.6%) who had mitral valve repair and 2702 (83.4%) who had mitral valve replacement. Early mortalities for mitral valve repair and mitral valve replacement were 0.2% and 0.9%, respectively. There were trends towards a higher proportion of degenerative valve lesions (24.6%, 35.8%, 54.7% in periods I, II, and III, respectively) and a lower proportion of rheumatic valve lesions (71.0%, 62.6%, 38.0%) in more recent years. The proportions of minimally invasive surgery (0.7%, 2.1%, 30.2%), mitral valve repair (8.3%, 15.4%, 27.5%), use of a bioprosthesis (10.1%, 17.0%, 23.1%), and concomitant tricuspid valve procedures (13.2%, 28.5%, 46.0%) increased dramatically, while early mortality remained constant during the 10-year period (1.0%, 0.3%, 0.9%). CONCLUSIONS: In the past 10 years, the spectrum of mitral valve disease experienced a trend towards more degenerative valve lesions and less rheumatic valve lesions in East China. Mitral valve repair, bioprostheses, tricuspid valve repair, and minimally invasive surgery have been more often applied in recent years.  
Arrhythmia insensitive rapid cardiac T1 mapping: comparison to modified look locker inversion recovery T1 mapping in mitral valve prolapse patients.  ;We compare a saturation recovery arrhythmia insensitive rapid (AIR) T1 mapping technique which is less sensitive to heart rate and requires shorter breath-holds to modified Look-Locker inversion recovery (MOLLI) T1 mapping in patients with mitral valve prolapse. 55 patients underwent AIR and MOLLI at 1.5 T. AIR and MOLLI-derived blood and myocardial T1 values and extracellular volume (ECV) were measured by two independent readers. T1 values and ECV from both techniques and inter-reader agreement were compared with Lin's concordance correlation coefficient (LCC) and reduced major axis regression. T1 values were consistently overestimated for AIR compared to MOLLI and vice versa for ECV. In the mitral valve prolapse population, mean native and post contrast myocardial T1 value for MOLLI were 1000 ± 40 ms and 411.9 ± 44.2 ms respectively and 1090.6 ± 58.7 ms and 488.2 ± 45.7 ms for AIR. Mean native and post contrast blood T1 values for MOLLI were 1566.6 ± 72.3 ms and 276.6 ± 34.1 ms respectively versus 1657.2 ± 180.9 ms and 294.9 ± 35.6 ms for AIR. AIR underestimated ECV relative to MOLLI (23.5 ± 0.4% vs 27.7 ± 0.4%). We found excellent inter-reader agreement (LCC all > 0.94, p < 0.0001) for both AIR and MOLLI techniques as well as intra-reader reliability (LCC all > 0.97, p < 0.0001). AIR can be performed in patients with mitral valve prolapse with excellent inter and intra-reader agreement, with higher T1 values compared to MOLLI, in line with other saturation recovery techniques. A consistent T1 mapping technique should be used when performing serial imaging.  
Cardiac Rehab for Functional Improvement.  ;PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Cardiac Rehabilitation (CR) was originally designed to return patients to their prior level of functioning after myocardial infarction (MI). Research has since revealed the mortality benefit of CR, and CR has been given a class 1A recommendation by the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC). In this review, we shift our focus back to function and highlight the most recent research on the functional benefits of CR in a broad range of cardiac diseases and conditions. RECENT FINDINGS: Currently, CR is indicated for patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), peripheral arterial disease (PAD), transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), left ventricular assist devices (LVADs), and cardiac transplant. Among patients with those conditions, CR has been shown to improve exercise capacity, cognition, mental health, and overall quality of life. As survival of cardiac diseases increases, CR emerges as an increasingly important tool to lend quality to patients' lives and therefore give meaning to survival.  
Impact of obesity on adverse in-hospital outcomes in patients undergoing percutaneous mitral valve edge-to-edge repair using MitraClip® procedure - Results from the German nationwide inpatient sample.  ;BACKGROUND AND AIM: The number of percutaneous edge-to-edge mitral regurgitation (MR) valve repairs with MitraClip® implantations increased exponentially in recent years. Studies have suggested an obesity survival paradox in patients with cardiovascular diseases. We investigated the influence of obesity on adverse in-hospital outcomes in patients with MitraClip® implantation. METHODS AND RESULTS: We analyzed data on characteristics of patients and in-hospital outcomes for all percutaneous mitral valve repairs using the edge-to-edge MitraClip®-technique in Germany 2011-2015 stratified for obesity vs. normal-weight/over-weight. The nationwide inpatient sample comprised 13,563 inpatients undergoing MitraClip® implantations. Among them, 1017 (7.5%) patients were coded with obesity. Obese patients were younger (75 vs.77 years,P < 0.001), more often female (45.4% vs.39.5%,P < 0.001), had more often heart failure (87.1% vs.79.2%,P < 0.001) and renal insufficiency (67.0% vs.56.4%,P < 0.001). Obese and non-obese patients were comparable regarding major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) and in-hospital death. The combined endpoint of cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR), mechanical ventilation and death was more often reached in non-obese than in obese patients with a trend towards significance (20.6%vs.18.2%,P = 0.066). Obesity was an independent predictor of reduced events regarding the combined endpoint of CPR, mechanical ventilation and death (OR 0.75, 95%CI 0.64-0.89,P < 0.001), but not for reduced in-hospital mortality (P = 0.355) or reduced MACCE rate (P = 0.108). Obesity class III was associated with an elevated risk for pulmonary embolism (OR 5.66, 95%CI 1.35-23.77,P = 0.018). CONCLUSIONS: We observed an obesity paradox regarding the combined endpoint of CPR, mechanical ventilation and in-hospital death in patients undergoing MitraClip® implantation, but our results failed to confirm an impact of obesity on in-hospital survival or MACCE.

Structural durability of early-generation Transcatheter aortic valve replacement valves compared with surgical aortic valve replacement valves in heart valve surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis.  ;BACKGROUND: The current treatment for aortic stenosis includes open surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) as well as endovascular transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). This study aims to compare the 1-year, 2-3 year and 5-year structural durability of TAVR valves with that of SAVR valves. METHOD: A systematic literature search was conducted in July 2019 on Medline (via PubMed), Embase and Cochrane electronic databases according to the PRISMA guidelines. RESULTS: Thirteen randomized controlled trials were included. From the meta-analysis, we observed higher rates of 1-year (OR: 7.65, CI: 4.57 to 12.79, p < 0.00001), 2-3-year (OR: 13.49, CI: 5.66 to 32.16, p < 0.00001) and 5-year paravalvular regurgitation (OR: 14.51, CI: 4.47 to 47.09, p < 0.00001) associated with the TAVR valves than the SAVR valves. There were also higher rates of 1-year (OR: 5.00, CI: 3.27 to 7.67, p < 0.00001), 2-3-year (OR: 8.14, CI: 3.58 to 18.50, p < 0.00001) and 5-year moderate or severe aortic regurgitation (MD: 14.65, CI: 4.55 to 47.19, p < 0.00001), and higher rates of 1-year (OR: 3.55, CI: 1.86 to 6.77, p = 0.0001), 2-3-year (OR: 3.55, CI: 1.86 to 6.77, p = 0.0001) and 5-year reintervention (OR: 3.55, CI: 1.22 to 10.38, p = 0.02) in the TAVR valves as compared to SAVR valves. CONCLUSION: TAVR valves appear to be more susceptible to structural valve deterioration and thus potentially less structurally durable than SAVR valves, given that they may be associated with higher rates of moderate or severe aortic regurgitation, paravalvular regurgitation and reintervention in the 1-year-, 2-3 year, and 5-year period.  
Prognostic value of myocardial fibrosis in severe aortic stenosis: study protocol for a prospective observational multi-center study (FIB-AS).  ;BACKGROUND: Adverse cardiac remodeling with a myocardial fibrosis as a key pathophysiologic component may be associated to worse survival in aortic stenosis (AS) patients. Therefore, with the application of advanced cardiac imaging we aim to investigate left ventricular myocardial fibrosis in severe AS patients undergoing aortic valve replacement (AVR) and determine its impact with post-intervention clinical outcomes. METHODS: In a prospective, observational, cohort study patients with severe AS scheduled either for surgical or transcatheter AVR will be recruited from two tertiary heart centers in Denmark and Lithuania. All patients will receive standard of care in accordance with the current guidelines and will undergo additional imaging testing before and after AVR: echocardiography with deformation analysis and cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) with T1 parametric mapping. Those undergoing surgical AVR will also have a myocardial biopsy sampled at the time of a surgery for histological validation. Patients will be recruited over a 2-year period and followed up to 2 years to ascertain clinical outcomes. Follow-up CMR will be performed 12 months following AVR, and echocardiography with deformation analysis will be performed 3, 12, and 24 months following AVR. The study primary outcome is a composite of all-cause mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events. DISCUSSION: Despite continuous effort of research community there is still a lack of early predictors of left ventricular decompensation in AS, which could improve patient risk stratification and guide the optimal timing for aortic valve intervention, before irreversible left ventricular damage occurs. Advanced cardiac imaging and CMR derived markers of diffuse myocardial fibrosis could be utilized for this purpose. FIB-AS study is intended to invasively and non-invasively assess diffuse myocardial fibrosis in AS patients and investigate its prognostic significance in post-interventional outcomes. The results of the study will expand the current knowledge of cardiac remodeling in AS and will bring additional data on myocardial fibrosis and its clinical implications following AVR. ETHICS/DISSEMINATION: The study has full ethical approval and is actively recruiting patients. The results will be disseminated through scientific journals and conference presentations. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.govNCT03585933. Registered on 02 July 2018.  
The tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion to systolic pulmonary artery pressure index: Association with all-cause mortality in patients with moderate or severe tricuspid regurgitation.  ;"BACKGROUND: In patients with significant tricuspid regurgitation (TR) the conventional markers for the assessment of right ventricular (RV) systolic function may be less accurate. Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) indexed to systolic pulmonary artery pressure (SPAP) (TAPSE/SPAP) may be prognostically useful in pulmonary hypertension and left ventricular dysfunction. Our aim was to explore its use in patients with moderate or severe TR. METHODS: A total of 209 patients (72 ± 14 years, 56% women) with moderate (n = 123) or severe (n = 86) TR (primary in 6% and secondary in 94%) were followed up for a median of 80 months (mean 70 ± 33 months). The clinical correlates of TAPSE/SPAP index and association with all-cause mortality were assessed. RESULTS: The TAPSE/SPAP index was inversely correlated with all-cause mortality with an optimal threshold of 0.49 mm/mmHg. A low index was found in 139 (68%) patients. In a multivariate Cox regression analysis adjusted for age, smoking, coronary artery disease, left ventricular ejection fraction, right atrium area and mitral valve replacement, low TAPSE/SPAP index was associated with significantly higher hazard ratio of all-cause mortality (HR: 2.07; 95% CI 1.32-3.27, p = .002). Age, coronary artery disease, left ventricular ejection fraction and right atrium area were other independent predictors of all-cause mortality. CONCLUSION: The TAPSE/SPAP index, reflecting RV systolic function in the longitudinal axis corrected for force generating by the RV is a powerful predictor of all-cause mortality in patients with moderate or severe TR.

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement in patients with severe comorbidities: A retrospective cohort study.  ;OBJECTIVE: To investigate the long-term outcomes of patients with severe comorbidities (sCM) undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). BACKGROUND: The benefit of TAVR may be limited among patients with sCM due to a lack of mortality- or quality-of-life-benefit. METHODS: All TAVR patients in the Allina Health System between January 1, 2011 and August 7, 2018 were included (n = 890, 82 ± 8 years, 55% men). sCM included: severe lung disease, severe liver disease, end-stage renal disease, severe, severe dementia, severe dilated cardiomyopathy, and frailty. Outcomes between patients with (n = 215, 24%) and without (n = 675, 76%) sCM were compared. RESULTS: At baseline, patients with sCM had worse symptoms, higher STS-PROM and a lower Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) score compared to those without. During a median follow-up of 15 months (IQR, 7-29 months), there were 208 (23%) deaths. Patients with sCM had a lower 3-year survival free from all-cause mortality (40% vs. 79%, p < .001), and lower 3-year survival free from the composite endpoint of all-cause mortality, re-hospitalization for heart failure, myocardial infarction or stroke (31% vs. 64%, p < .001) compared to those without sCM. The estimated monthly increase in KCCQ scores following TAVR was 1.5, 95%CI (1.3, 1.7), p < .001 irrespective of sCM grouping. From Cox regression analysis, severe comorbidities, with the exception of liver disease, were associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality and any additional comorbidity was associated with a multiplicative increase in risk of mortality of 2.8 (95%CI 2.3, 3.6), p < .001. CONCLUSIONS: TAVR patients with sCM have poor 3-year outcomes but may experience improvements in their quality of life.  
An Image Guided Transapical Mitral Valve Leaflet Puncture Model of Controlled Volume Overload from Mitral Regurgitation in the Rat.  ;Mitral regurgitation (MR) is a widely prevalent heart valve lesion, which causes cardiac remodeling and leads to congestive heart failure. Though the risks of uncorrected MR and its poor prognosis are known, the longitudinal changes in cardiac function, structure and remodeling are incompletely understood. This knowledge gap has limited our understanding of the optimal timing for MR correction, and the benefit that early versus late MR correction may have on the left ventricle. To investigate the molecular mechanisms that underlie left ventricular remodeling in the setting of MR, animal models are necessary. Traditionally, the aorto-caval fistula model has been used to induce volume overload, which differs from clinically relevant lesions such as MR. MR represents a low-pressure volume overload hemodynamic stressor, which requires animal models that mimic this condition. Herein, we describe a rodent model of severe MR in which the anterior leaflet of the rat mitral valve is perforated with a 23G needle, in a beating heart, with echocardiographic image guidance. The severity of MR is assessed and confirmed with echocardiography, and the reproducibility of the model is reported.  
Valve-in-valve transcatheter aortic valve replacement in a young patient with a suspected COVID-19 infection: a surgical dilemma in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic.  ;We report on a case of a 57-year-old male patient, who underwent full root replacement in 2005 and now presented with high grade aortic insufficiency. On admission, the patient underwent a computed tomography scan which demonstrated interstitial infiltration in the left lung, highly suspicious for a COVID-19 infection that could not be confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. As there usually is a delay between infection and positive RT-PCR test results, the initial decision was to perform additional testing. However, the patient deteriorated quickly in spite of optimal medical therapy making urgent aortic valve replacement necessary. We decided to perform transcatheter aortic valve replacement to avoid cardiopulmonary bypass with shorter operative times, presumably shorter ventilation times and duration of intensive care unit stay, and thus a lesser risk for pulmonary complications.  
Obstructive heart failure with Cardiobacterium hominis infective endocarditis.  ;We illustrate the progression of Cardiobacterium hominis infective endocarditis in a patient with a bioprosthetic mitral valve and decompensated heart failure secondary to an obstructive septic vegetation.  
Electroacupuncture Pretreatment as a Novel Avenue to Protect Heart against Ischemia and Reperfusion Injury.  ;In recent years, the efficacy of electroacupuncture (EA) pretreatment generating ischemic tolerance mimicking ischemic pretreatment (IP) has been continuously confirmed, which was first found in the brain and then in the heart. Furthermore, researchers have observed the intensive cardioprotection impact of EA pretreatment on patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and heart valve replacement, indicating that EA pretreatment tends to be a valuable and advantageous avenue for preventing acute myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury or treatment of ischemic heart disease (IHD). In reality, the heart protection mechanism of EA pretreatment is robust and pleiotropic, of which the regulatory molecular pathways are involved in multichannel, multilevel, and multitarget, including energy metabolism, inflammatory response, calcium overload, oxidative stress, autophagy, and apoptosis. Through a growing number of clinical tests and basic experiments with animal models, researchers progressively explored the optimal acupoints and parameters, where EA pretreatment induced acute and delayed ischemic tolerance for myocardial protection. Thereby, this article aims to collect the relevant evidence on EA pretreatment against myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury (MIRI) and summarize the mechanism of cardioprotection of EA pretreatment to provide ideas and methods for further clinical applications.  
Sutureless aortic valve replacement with concomitant aortic arch reconstruction.  ;Sutureless aortic valve replacement (AVR) offers an alternative approach to the standard AVR in aortic valve disease. We herein report a case of an 82-year-old woman with severe aortic insufficiency and a persistent type 1 endoleak following a thoracic endovascular aortic repair, who underwent successful combined aortic arch reconstruction and sutureless AVR. The bioprosthesis, Perceval (LivaNova PLC, London, UK), a self-anchoring, self-expanding, sutureless valve, which can be implanted in selected patients with aortic insufficiency was used. Although the patient was frail and at a high risk of open-heart surgery, she had an uneventful postoperative course. Hence, Perceval may be a useful option for combined aortic arch reconstruction and aortic valve surgery in high-risk elderly patients.  
Omega-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids Decrease Aortic Valve Disease Through the Resolvin E1 and ChemR23 Axis.  ;BACKGROUND: Aortic valve stenosis (AVS), which is the most common valvular heart disease, causes a progressive narrowing of the aortic valve as a consequence of thickening and calcification of the aortic valve leaflets. The beneficial effects of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) in cardiovascular prevention have recently been demonstrated in a large randomized, controlled trial. In addition, n-3 PUFAs serve as the substrate for the synthesis of specialized proresolving mediators, which are known by their potent beneficial anti-inflammatory, proresolving, and tissue-modifying properties in cardiovascular disease. However, the effects of n-3 PUFA and specialized proresolving mediators on AVS have not yet been determined. The aim of this study was to identify the role of n-3 PUFA-derived specialized proresolving mediators in relation to the development of AVS. METHODS: Lipidomic and transcriptomic analyses were performed in human tricuspid aortic valves. Apoe-/- mice and wire injury in C57BL/6J mice were used as models for mechanistic studies. RESULTS: We found that n-3 PUFA incorporation into human stenotic aortic valves was higher in noncalcified regions compared with calcified regions. Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry-based lipid mediator lipidomics identified that the n-3 PUFA-derived specialized proresolving mediator resolvin E1 was dysregulated in calcified regions and acted as a calcification inhibitor. Apoe-/- mice expressing the Caenorhabditis elegans Fat-1 transgene (Fat-1tg×Apoe-/-), which enables the endogenous synthesis of n-3 PUFA and increased valvular n-3 PUFA content, exhibited reduced valve calcification, lower aortic valve leaflet area, increased M2 macrophage polarization, and improved echocardiographic parameters. Finally, abrogation of the resolvin E1 receptor ChemR23 enhanced disease progression, and the beneficial effects of Fat-1tg were abolished in the absence of ChemR23. CONCLUSIONS: n-3 PUFA-derived resolvin E1 and its receptor ChemR23 emerge as a key axis in the inhibition of AVS progression and may represent a novel potential therapeutic opportunity to be evaluated in patients with AVS.  
Long-term outcomes of ablation for ventricular arrhythmias in mitral valve prolapse.  ;"PURPOSE: Prior studies reporting efficacy of radiofrequency catheter ablation for complex ventricular ectopy in mitral valve prolapse (MVP) are limited by selective inclusion of bileaflet MVP, papillary muscle only ablation, or short-term follow-up. We sought to evaluate the long-term incidence of hemodynamically significant ventricular tachycardia (VT) or fibrillation (VF) in patients with MVP after initial ablation. METHODS: We studied consecutive patients with MVP undergoing ablation for complex ventricular ectopy between 2013 and 2017 at our institution. Of 580 patients with MVP, we included 15 (2.6%, 10 women; mean age 50 ± 14 years, 53% bileaflet) with complex ventricular ectopy treated with initial ablation. RESULTS: Over a median follow-up of 3406 (1875-6551) days or 9 years, 5 of 15 (33%) patients developed hemodynamically significant VT/VF after their initial ablation and underwent placement of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). Three of 5 also underwent repeat ablations. Sustained VT was inducible prior to index ablation in all 5 who developed VT/VF, compared to none of the 10 patients who did not develop VT/VF after index ablation (p = 0.002). Complex ventricular ectopy at index ablation was multifocal in all 5 patients who underwent repeat intervention versus 4 of 10 patients (40%) who did not (p = 0.04). All 3 patients with subsequent VT/VF who underwent repeat ablation had a new clinically dominant focus of ventricular arrhythmia and 3 of the patients with ICD had appropriate VT/VF therapies. CONCLUSIONS: In the long term, a subset of MVP patients treated with ablation for ventricular arrhythmias, all with multifocal ectopy on initial EP study, develop hemodynamically significant VT/VF. Our findings suggest the progressive nature of ventricular arrhythmias in patients with MVP and multifocal ectopy.  "

Combined cardiac anomalies in Noonan syndrome: A case report.  ;INTRODUCTION: Noonan syndrome is the second most common syndromic cause of congenital heart disease. Most patients have an autosomal dominant inheritance, but some cases may be sporadic. Pulmonary stenosis is the most common cardiac manifestation in Noonan syndrome, associated with the atrial septal defect and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. A combination of these three is present only in 5% of patients. PRESENTATION OF CASE: We report a case of a 21-year-old female who presented to our hospital concomitant cardiac lesions associated with pulmonary stenosis, atrial septal defect, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. This combination of cardiac defects is an infrequent manifestation of Noonan syndrome. The patient presented with complaints of exertion syncope over the past two years. 2D-Echocardiography showed biventricular hypertrophy, dysplastic pulmonary valve, severe pulmonary stenosis, asymmetric septal hypertrophy and large atrial septal defect. The genetic analysis report showed autosomal dominant inheritance with Ras/MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) Positive. DISCUSSION: Due to the wide spectrum of symptoms and presentations in Noonan cases, accurate clinical and genetic diagnosis, and comprehensive management of the disorder are strongly recommended. CONCLUSION: We have described a case of rare combination of cardiovascular defects in Noonan Syndrome with a view to achieve better insight into the disease course and advantages of timely treatment and follow up. Our patient is currently in follow-up after treatment with percutaneous balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty, has improved symptoms, and is awaiting heart transplant.  
Pediatric Mitral Regurgitation: Standardized Repair-Oriented Strategy With Leaflet Plication.  ;"To introduce a standardized strategy and reproducible procedures of mitral repair for mitral regurgitation in the pediatric population with leaflet plication as a principal technique. Consecutive patients who had undergone mitral repair by our standardized repair-oriented strategy in our institution from January 2016 to December 2019 were included retrospectively. The standardized repair strategy included 3-step inspections and repair from the subvalvular to leaflet, and then to the annular level. The main surgical techniques included chordae detachment, papillary muscle splitting, leaflet plication, and posterior annuloplasty. The indication for leaflet plication was that the distance between 2 adjacent chordae tendineae was greater than 4 mm. A total of 113 patients were enrolled. During 22.6-month (range, 2-50 months) follow-up period, primary endpoint was documented in 15 (13.3%) patients, including 1 (0.9%) death, 0 transplantation, and 14 (12.4%) functional mitral failure. Freedom form primary endpoints at 6 months, 1 year, and 3 years was 94.7%, 94.7%, and 82.3%, respectively. Significant independent predictors of functional mitral valve failure were younger age (hazard ratio [HR], 0.28; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.04-0.72; P = 0.037) and ischemic mitral regurgitation (MR) (HR, 24.34; 95% CI, 4.52-47.33; P < 0.001). Leaflet plication was significantly associated with well-functioned mitral valve (HR, 7.42; 95% CI, 2.35-30.54; P = 0.004). Compared with nonischemic MR group, ischemic MR group was noted with higher occurrence of primary endpoint events (11/28 vs 4/85, P < 0.001). The short- to mid-term outcomes of standardized mitral repair technique with leaflet plication were favorable, among which, however, repair for mitral regurgitation with ischemic lesions is comparatively challenging.

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement in patients with paradoxical low-flow, low-gradient aortic stenosis: Incidence and predictors of treatment futility.  ;BACKGROUND: Few and controversial data exist on the outcomes of patients with paradoxical low-flow, low-gradient aortic stenosis (PLFLG-AS) following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). This study aims to better characterize clinical outcomes and predictors of treatment futility in PLFLG-AS patients undergoing TAVR. METHODS: In this multicenter study, 318 patients with PLFLG-AS undergoing TAVR were categorized according to treatment futility, defined as all-cause mortality, poor functional status (NYHA class III-IV) or deterioration in functional class at 1-year follow-up. Clinical outcomes and the factors associated with treatment futility were assessed. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 81.0 ± 8.3 years and 50.3% were women. At 1-year follow-up, 17.6% died and 12.9% had heart failure hospitalization. Residual impaired functional capacity (NYHA ≥ II) was present in 54.4% of patients who were alive at 1-year, and 9.8% remained in NYHA III/IV. The primary endpoint was observed in 103 (32.4%) patients, of which 54% died and 46% had a poor or worsening functional class. Factors independently associated with treatment futility were the presence of atrial fibrillation (AF) (OR:1.79, 95%CI, 1.04-3.10), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (OR:2.66, 95%CI, 1.50-4.74) and a lower SVi (OR per each decrease in 10 ml/m2:1.89, 95%CI, 1.06-3.45). The risk of treatment futility of patients with AF, COPD and a SVi < 30 ml/m2 was 66.38% (95%CI, 54.29%-78.48%). CONCLUSION: Close to one-third of patients with PLFLG-AS failed to derive a benefit from TAVR. The presence of AF, COPD and a low SVi were predictors of treatment futility. Being able to identify patients less likely to improve after the procedure may help to guide management and improve outcomes in patients with PLFLG-AS.  
Dexfenfluramine and Pergolide Cause Heart Valve Disease via Valve Metabolic Reprogramming and Ongoing Matrix Remodeling.  ;Several clinical reports indicate that the use of amphetaminic anorectic drugs or ergot derivatives could cause valvular heart disease (VHD). We sought to investigate whether valvular lesions develop in response to long-term oral administration of these drugs and to identify drug-targeted biological processes that may lead to VHD. Treatment of New Zealand White rabbits with pergolide, dexfenfluramine, or high-dose serotonin for 16 weeks induced valvular alterations characterized by extracellular matrix remodeling. Transcriptome profiling of tricuspid valves using RNA sequencing revealed distinct patterns of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that clustered according to the different treatments. Genes that were affected by the three treatments were functionally enriched for reduced cell metabolism processes. The two drugs yielded more changes in gene expression than serotonin and shared most of the DEGs. These DEGs were mostly enriched for decreased biosynthetic processes, increased cell-matrix interaction, and cell response to growth factors, including TGF-β, which was associated with p38 MAPK activation. Treatment with pergolide specifically affected genes involved in homeostasis, which was corroborated by the activation of the master regulator of cell energy homeostasis, AMPK-α, as well as decreased levels of metabolism-related miR-107. Thus, both pergolide and dexfenfluramine may cause VHD through valve metabolic reprogramming and matrix remodeling.  
TAVR for low-flow, low-gradient aortic stenosis: Prognostic impact of aortic valve calcification.  ;"BACKGROUND: Compared to high gradient aortic stenosis (AS), patients with low-flow, low-gradient AS have higher mortality after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), but distinct outcome predictors in this patient subset are yet to be determined. The present study investigated the prognostic impact of aortic valve calcification (AVC) in patients with low-flow, low-gradient AS undergoing TAVR. METHODS: This retrospective single-center analysis includes all patients undergoing TAVR for severe low-flow, low-gradient AS (n = 526), ie, low EF low gradient AS (LEF-LG AS; n = 290) and paradoxical low-flow, low-gradient AS (PLF-LG AS; n = 236), in whom AVC was quantified from contrast-enhanced multislice computed tomography images. AVCdensity was defined as calcium volume per annulus area. Patients were trichotomized according to sex-specific AVCdensity tertiles in both subgroups. All-cause mortality was assessed by Kaplan-Meier analyses and independent outcome predictors were determined by multivariable analyses. RESULTS: In both subgroups, patients with high AVCdensity had higher mean transvalvular gradients at baseline and higher rates of PVL after TAVR. High AVCdensity was associated with lowest 1- and 3-year mortality after TAVR in the LEF-LG AS but not in the PLF-LG AS group. According to multivariable analysis AVCdensity was independently associated with better survival in LEF-LG AS patients (HR 0.73 [0.60-0.88], P = .0011), but not in those with PLF-LG AS (HR 0.91 [0.73-1.14], P = .42). CONCLUSIONS: Quantification of AVC may not only be of diagnostic but also of prognostic value, as it facilitates the selection of LEF-LG AS patients with higher probability of beneficial outcome after TAVR.

T2-weighted cardiac magnetic resonance image and myocardial biomarker in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  ;The phenomenon of high signal intensity on T2-weighted imaging of cardiac magnetic resonance in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) has been previously studied. However, the underlying histopathologic mechanism remains unclear. Elevated cardiac troponin can be detected in some HCM patients. A reasonable hypothesis is that high myocardial T2 signal is a potential marker of myocardial injury in HCM. We sought to investigate the association between cardiac troponin and the extent of high T2 signals in HCM patients.Forty-four HCM patients underwent 3.0T cardiac magnetic resonance scanning. On T2-weighted images, the number of segments with high-signal intensity (myocardium-to-skeletal muscle signal intensity ratio >2) and the percentage of high-signal area (>2 standard deviation above the remote tissue) were measured in 16 myocardial segments along the LV mid-myocardial circumference on 3 short-axis images. The level of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) was also assessed.Myocardial high T2 signals were identified in 33 (75%) patients and 144 (20.5%) segments. Elevated hs-cTnT was observed in 28 (63.6%) patients. The Cochran-Armitage test showed a statistically significant trend of increasing levels of hs-cTnT with elevated number of segments with myocardial high T2 signal (P = .002). Further, the percentage of myocardium with high T2 signal was significantly associated with the hs-cTnT level (Pearson correlation: r = 0.388, P = .009).Myocardium with high T2 signals was very common in patients with HCM.Its extent is related with the level of plasma hs-cTnT.  
Survival characteristics and prognostic importance of echocardiographic measurements of right heart size and function in dogs with pulmonary hypertension.  ;"BACKGROUND: The clinical relevance of echocardiographic measurements of right heart size and function in dogs with pulmonary hypertension (PH) is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To determine if echocardiographic measurements of right heart size and right ventricular (RV) function are associated with survival times in dogs with PH. ANIMALS: Eighty-two client-owned dogs. METHODS: Retrospective study where data from medical records and baseline echocardiographic examinations were collected and measured in a standardized manner. Owners or primary veterinarians were contacted for outcome data. RESULTS: Enlargement of the right atrium (88%), RV (69%), and pulmonary artery (72%) was common. One-third of the cases had reduced RV function quantified by two-dimensional echocardiography-derived tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE). Decreased TAPSE was significantly (P = .008) more common in dogs with PH not secondary to left heart disease (LHD; 43%) compared to dogs with PH secondary to LHD (14%) but median survival times (182, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 39-309 versus 298, 95% CI = 85-314 days, respectively) were not significantly different (P = .78). Right atrial area (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.72, 95% CI = 1.58-4.70), TAPSE < 3.23 mm/kg0.284 (HR = 2.19, 95% CI = 1.28-3.74), and right heart failure (HR = 2.05, 95% CI = 1.18-3.57) were independently associated with shorter survival time (P ≤ .04). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Right atrial area, RV function (TAPSE < 3.23 mm/kg0.284 ), and right heart failure offer clinically relevant prognostic information in dogs with PH. Results support the quantitative assessment of right heart size and function in dogs with PH.  "
Catheter ablation of the cavotricuspid isthmus in patients with atrial flutter: predictors of long-term outcomes.  ;"BACKGROUND: Predictors of long‑term outcomes and an optimal catheter set for ablation of the cavotricuspid isthmus in patients with atrial flutter (AFL) are not well known. AIMS: This study aimed to identify predictors of clinical events following ablation. METHODS: We studied 741 patients (mean [SD] age, 62.2 [10.8] years; 248 women) who were followed for a mean (SD) time of 4.4 (2.7) years. The 2- versus 3‑electrode approach and clinical predictors ofclinical events during follow‑up were analyzed. RESULTS: The 2‑electrode approach was faster (mean [SD] time, 62.5 [30.3] vs 101.4 [51] min; P <0.001), associated with shorter fluoroscopy time (13.1 [9.3] vs 20.3 [12.4] min; P < 0.001), cost‑effective (8.29 [2.82] vs 11.89 [2.51] units; P <0.001), and more effective (92.1% vs 86.1%; P = 0.012). The independent predictors of AFL recurrence were: calcium blocker use (hazard ratio [HR], 3.24; 95% CI, 1.64-6.4), mitral valve disease (HR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.12-2.95), previous stroke and/ or TIA (HR, 2.38; 95% CI, 1.21-4.65), pulmonary artery dilatation (HR, 3.94; 95% CI, 1.22-12.73), and previous pulmonary embolism (HR, 3.77; 95% CI, 1.14-12.43); of atrial fibrillation (AF): previous AF (HR, 6.054; 95% CI, 4.58-8), left atrial enlargement (HR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12-1.81), number of antiarrhythmic drugs used (HR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.05-1.28), and mitral valve disease (HR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.04-1.58); of pacemaker implantation: tachycardia‑bradycardia syndrome (HR, 6.17; 95% CI, 3.16-12.05), previous second-/third‑degree atrioventricular block (HR, 29.4; 95% CI, 7.37-117.28), centrally acting hypotensive drugs (HR, 29.55; 95% CI, 6.14-142.25), aortic dilatation or aneurysm (HR, 2.58; 95% CI, 1.06-6.3), a labile international normalized ratio (HR, 3.45; 95% CI, 1.72-6.93), left bundle branch block (HR, 4.7; 95% CI, 1.49-14.82), the shortest R‑R interval during AFL (HR, 1.003; 95% CI, 1.001-1.005), previous cardiac surgery (HR, 2.69; 95% CI, 1.27-5.7), and aortic valve disease (HR, 2.22; 95% CI, 1.08-4.59). CONCLUSION: Ablation of cavotricuspid isthmus with a minimal number of electrodes is safe and effective. Specific predictors of clinical events during long‑term follow-up can be determined.  "
[Bentall-DeBono procedure with xenopericardial valved conduit: a 24-year follow-up data].  ;Long-term outcome of surgical treatment of a patient with severe aortic insufficiency and ascending aortic aneurysm is reported. The patient underwent Bentall-DeBono procedure with xenopericardial valved conduit. This technique is associated with no complications specific for Dacron conduits and ensures clinical compensation of heart failure, improves prognosis and quality of life.  
Mitral Stenosis After MitraClip: How to Avoid and How to Treat.  ;PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The goal of the paper is to highlight the importance of procedural planning and patient selection when using the MitraClip device in treating severe mitral regurgitation (MR). RECENT FINDINGS: Following the recent results of the COAPT trial and FDA approval for functional MR patients, the indications for mitral clip are continuing to expand. Because of this, mitral stenosis from mitral clip can become a problem if the appropriate patients are not selected. Proper valve imaging, utilizing 3D transesophageal echocardiography to identify the pathology, is important to prevent iatrogenic mitral stenosis. In the unfortunate event of severe mitral stenosis as a result of the MitraClip device, surgery is the only treatment.  
"""Pure"" severe aortic stenosis without concomitant valvular heart diseases: echocardiographic and pathophysiological features.  ";"PURPOSE: In echocardiography the severity of aortic stenosis (AS) is defined by effective orifice area (EOA), mean pressure gradient (mPGAV) and transvalvular flow velocity (maxVAV). The hypothesis of the present study was to confirm the pathophysiological presence of combined left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), diastolic dysfunction (DD) and pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH) in patients with ""pure"" severe AS. METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients (n = 306) with asymptomatic (n = 133) and symptomatic (n = 173) ""pure"" severe AS (mean age 78 ± 9.5 years) defined by indexed EOA < 0.6 cm2 were enrolled between 2014 and 2016. AS patients were divided into 4 subgroups according to mPGAV and indexed left ventricular stroke volume: low flow (LF) low gradient (LG)-AS (n = 133), normal flow (NF) LG-AS (n = 91), LF high gradient (HG)-AS (n = 21) and NFHG-AS (n = 61). Patients with ""pure"" severe AS showed mean mPGAV of 31.7 ± 9.1 mmHg and mean maxVAV of 3.8 ± 0.6 m/s. Only 131 of 306 patients (43%) exhibited mPGAV > 40 mmHg and maxVAV > 4 m/s documenting incongruencies of the AS severity assessment by Doppler echocardiography. LVH was documented in 81%, DD in 76% and PAH in 80% of AS patients. 54% of ""pure"" AS patients exhibited all three alterations. Ranges of mPGAV and maxVAV were higher in patients with all three alterations compared to patients with less than three. 224 (73%) patients presented LG-conditions and 82 (27%) HG-conditions. LVH was predominant in NF-AS (p = 0.014) and PAH in LFHG-AS (p = 0.014). Patients' treatment was retrospectively assessed (surgery: n = 100, TAVI: n = 48, optimal medical treatment: n = 156). CONCLUSION: In patients with ""pure"" AS according to current guidelines the presence of combined LVH, DD and PAH as accepted pathophysiological sequelae of severe AS cannot be confirmed. Probably, the detection of these secondary cardiac alterations might improve the diagnostic algorithm to avoid overestimation of AS severity.  "
Mitral and Tricuspid Transcatheter Interventions Current Indications and Future Directions.  ;Valvular heart disease is responsible for a high rate of morbidity and mortality, especially in the elderly population. With the emergence of new transcatheter treatment options, the therapeutic spectrum for patients with valvular heart disease has considerably expanded during the past years. Interventional treatment of the mitral and tricuspid valve requires an individualized and versatile approach owing to the different etiologies of valvular dysfunction and the complex anatomy of the atrioventricular valves. This article aims to review recent developments, summarize the evidence, indications and limitations of the available systems, and provide a glimpse into the future of transcatheter interventions for the treatment of mitral and tricuspid valve disease.  
P-Wave Area Predicts New Onset Atrial Fibrillation in Mitral Stenosis: A Machine Learning Approach.  ;"Introduction: Mitral stenosis is associated with an atrial cardiomyopathic process, leading to abnormal atrial electrophysiology, manifesting as prolonged P-wave duration (PWD), larger P-wave area, increased P-wave dispersion (PWDmax-PWDmin), and/or higher P-wave terminal force on lead V1 (PTFV1) on the electrocardiogram. Methods: This was a single-center retrospective study of Chinese patients, diagnosed with mitral stenosis in sinus rhythm at baseline, between November 2009 and October 2016. Automated ECG measurements from raw data were determined. The primary outcome was incident atrial fibrillation (AF). Results: A total 59 mitral stenosis patients were included (age 59 [54-65] years, 13 (22%) males). New onset AF was observed in 27 patients. Age (odds ratio [OR]: 1.08 [1.01-1.16], P = 0.017), systolic blood pressure (OR: 1.03 [1.00-1.07]; P = 0.046), mean P-wave area in V3 (odds ratio: 3.97 [1.32-11.96], P = 0.014) were significant predictors of incident AF. On multivariate analysis, age (OR: 1.08 [1.00-1.16], P = 0.037) and P-wave area in V3 (OR: 3.64 [1.10-12.00], P = 0.034) remained significant predictors of AF. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis showed that the optimum cut-off for P-wave area in V3 was 1.45 Ashman units (area under the curve: 0.65) for classification of new onset AF. A decision tree learning model with individual and non-linear interaction variables with age achieved the best performance for outcome prediction (accuracy = 0.84, precision = 0.84, recall = 0.83, F-measure = 0.84). Conclusion: Atrial electrophysiological alterations in mitral stenosis can detected on the electrocardiogram. Age, systolic blood pressure, and P-wave area in V3 predicted new onset AF. A decision tree learning model significantly improved outcome prediction.  "
Suprasternal approach to transcatheter aortic valve replacement in a complex congenital pediatric patient presenting with cardiogenic shock.  ;Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) offers well established benefit for adults with severe aortic stenosis, although applications in the pediatric population remain limited. We describe a case of a 15-year-old male with complex congenital heart disease presenting with cardiogenic shock in the setting of mixed severe aortic stenosis (AS) and severe aortic insufficiency (AI). Self-expanding TAVR was performed via suprasternal approach with robust clinical improvement. At one month follow up, he had resolution of clinical heart failure with improvement in ejection fraction and no symptoms of valvulopathy. To our knowledge, there have been no described cases of suprasternal TAVR in a pediatric patient.  
Quantitative Assessment of Acute Regurgitation Following TAVR: A Multicenter Pooled Analysis of 2,258 Valves.  ;OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess acute regurgitation following transcatheter aortic valve replacement, comparing different implanted transcatheter heart valves. BACKGROUND: Regurgitation following transcatheter aortic valve replacement influences all-cause mortality. Thus far, no quantitative comparison of regurgitation among multiple commercially available transcatheter heart valves has been performed. METHODS: Aortograms from a multicenter cohort of consecutive 3,976 transcatheter aortic valve replacements were evaluated in this pooled analysis. A total of 2,258 (58.3%) were considered analyzable by an independent academic core laboratory using video densitometry. Results of quantitative regurgitation are shown as percentages. The valves evaluated were the ACURATE (n = 115), Centera (n = 11), CoreValve (n = 532), Direct Flow Medical (n = 21), Evolut PRO (n = 95), Evolut R (n = 295), Inovare (n = 4), Lotus (n = 546), Lotus Edge (n = 3), SAPIEN XT (n = 239), and SAPIEN 3 (n = 397). For the main analysis, only valves with more than 50 procedures (7 types) were used. RESULTS: The Lotus valve had the lowest mean regurgitation (3.5 ± 4.4%), followed by Evolut PRO (7.4 ± 6.5%), SAPIEN 3 (7.6 ± 7.1%), Evolut R (7.9 ± 7.4%), SAPIEN XT (8.8 ± 7.5%), ACURATE (9.6 ± 9.2%) and CoreValve (13.7 ± 10.7%) (analysis of variance p < 0.001). The only valves that statistically differed from all their counterparts were Lotus (as the lowest regurgitation) and CoreValve (the highest). The proportion of patients presenting with moderate or severe regurgitation followed the same ranking order: Lotus (2.2%), Evolut PRO (5.3%), SAPIEN 3 (8.3%), Evolut R (8.8%), SAPIEN XT (10.9%), ACURATE (11.3%), and CoreValve (30.1%) (chi-square p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In this pooled analysis stemming from daily clinical practice, the Lotus valve was shown to have the best immediate sealing. This analysis reflects the objective evaluation of regurgitation by an academic core laboratory (nonsponsored) in a real-world cohort of patients using a quantitative technique.  
Rheumatic valvular heart disease combined with woven coronary artery: a case report.  ;BACKGROUND: Woven coronary artery (WCA) is an extremely rare congenital anomaly in which a part of epicardial coronary artery is divided into thin channels, that twist along the axis of the coronary arteries and then merge again as the main coronary lumen. This anomaly is regarded as a benign condition because the blood flow is normal. Very few cases of WCA have been reported. CASE PRESENTATION: Herein we report a case of a 44-year-old man who was admitted to our hospital due to 20 years of repeated episodes of heart palpitations, 2 years of shortness of breath after activity, and the symptoms were aggravated for 1 month. He had history of inferior myocardial infarction and atrial fibrillation. Color Doppler echocardiography revealed rheumatic heart disease, severe mitral regurgitation, mild-moderate tricuspid regurgitation, moderate pulmonary hypertension. Coronary angiography revealed 60-85% diffuse stenosis in the middle of left anterior descending artery, 60-90% diffuse stenosis in the middle of left circumflex artery, 30-40% diffuse stenosis in the proximal segment of right coronary artery, and WCA anomaly in the middle, and distal segments of right coronary artery. CONCLUSION: The patient successfully underwent prosthetic valve replacement and left anterior descending coronary artery bypass grafting, and had a good recovery after surgery. Further studies are needed to fully understand the disease and determine appropriate treatment options.  
Longitudinal Changes in Cardiac Structure and Function From Adolescence to Young Adulthood in Participants With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: The TODAY Follow-Up Study.  ;"BACKGROUND: Heart failure is a prominent complication of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). The goal of this study was to provide longitudinal data on cardiac structure and function (and cross-sectional comparison to normal-weight and obese controls without T2D) in individuals followed from adolescence with youth-onset T2D. METHODS: In the TODAY study (Treatment Options for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Adolescents and Youth), echocardiograms were performed at study years 4 to 5 and 9 to 10. Echocardiograms were also obtained at years 8 to 9 in a control population of age, race/ethnicity, and sex-matched normal-weight and obese individuals without diabetes mellitus. Study outcomes were measures of left ventricular structure and function. The cohort included 411 participants with T2D, 194 obese controls, and 51 normal-weight controls. RESULTS: At follow-up, mean participant age was 23 years, 65% women, 20% non-Hispanic white, 35% non-Hispanic black, and 39% Hispanic. Ejection fraction was <52% in 11.7% of male participants with T2D. Diastolic function declined during follow-up in participants with T2D (mitral valve lateral E/Em increased 0.72±0.12 in women and 0.50±0.17 in men; P<0.01) and was significantly higher than obese controls (women, 6.65±1.89 versus 5.66±1.37; men, 6.15±1.90 versus 5.26±1.31; P<0.0001). Predictors of adverse changes included hypertension, obesity, female sex, Hispanic and non-Hispanic black ethnicity, worse glycemic control, and elevated heart rate. Cardiac structural abnormalities, left ventricular hypertrophy, or concentric geometry, were highest in those with T2D (15.8% versus 5.7% obese versus 0% normal weight). CONCLUSIONS: Adverse changes in cardiac structure and function changed significantly from adolescence to early adulthood in participants with youth-onset T2D.

Facilitating transcatheter aortic valve implantation in the era of COVID-19: Recommendations for programmes.  ;The COVID-19 pandemic continues to significantly impact the treatment of people living with aortic stenosis, and access to transcatheter aortic valve implantation. Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) programmes require unique coordinated processes that are currently experiencing multiple disruptions and are guided by rapidly evolving protocols. We present a series of recommendations for TAVI programmes to adapt to the new demands, based on recent evidence and the international expertise of nurse leaders and collaborators in this field. Although recommended in most guidelines, the uptake of the role of the TAVI programme nurse is uneven across international regions. COVID-19 is further highlighting why a nurse-led central point of coordination and communication is a vital asset for patients and programmes. We propose an alternative streamlined evaluation pathway to minimize patients' pre-procedure exposure to the hospital environment while ensuring appropriate treatment decision and shared decision-making. The competing demands created by COVID-19 require vigilant wait list management, with risk stratification, telephone surveillance and optimized triage and prioritization. A minimalist approach with close scrutiny of all parts of the procedure has become an imperative to avoid any complications and ensure patients' accelerated recovery. Lastly, we outline a nurse-led protocol of rapid mobilization and reconditioning as an effective strategy to facilitate safe next-day discharge home. As the pandemic abates, TAVI programmes must facilitate access to care without compromising patient safety, enable hospitals to manage the competing demands created by COVID-19 and establish new processes to support patients living with valvular heart disease.  
Circulating microRNAs vs. aortic diameter in bicuspid aortic valve aortopathy.  ;There is growing clinical need and interest to implement novel risk prediction tools in bicuspid aortic valve-associated proximal aortic disease, so-called bicuspid aortic valve aortopathy. Inherent limitations of the diameter-based risk stratification for adverse aortic events in bicuspid aortic valve aortopathy patients have recently been recognized. Therefore, alternative diagnostic tools and subsequent adjustments in the treatment guidelines are urgently needed. Herein, we summarize the current evidence on recent diagnostic developments to improve risk stratification in bicuspid aortic valve aortopathy, including circulating microRNAs as biomarkers to predict the progression of aortic disease.  
Overexpression of Kif1A in the Developing Drosophila Heart Causes Valvar and Contractility Defects: Implications for Human Congenital Heart Disease.  ;"Left-sided congenital heart defects (CHDs) are among the most common forms of congenital heart disease, but a disease-causing gene has only been identified in a minority of cases. Here, we identified a candidate gene for CHDs, KIF1A, that was associated with a chromosomal balanced translocation t(2;8)(q37;p11) in a patient with left-sided heart and aortic valve defects. The breakpoint was in the 5' untranslated region of the KIF1A gene at 2q37, which suggested that the break affected the levels of Kif1A gene expression. Transgenic fly lines overexpressing Kif1A specifically in the heart muscle (or all muscles) caused diminished cardiac contractility, myofibrillar disorganization, and heart valve defects, whereas cardiac knockdown had no effect on heart structure or function. Overexpression of Kif1A also caused increased collagen IV deposition in the fibrous network that normally surrounds the fly heart. Kif1A overexpression in C2C12 myoblasts resulted in specific displacement of the F-actin fibers, probably through a direct interaction with G-actin. These results point to a Kif1A-mediated disruption of F-actin organization as a potential mechanism for the pathogenesis in at least some human CHDs.  "
Antithrombotic Therapy in Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia: Real-World Data from the Gemelli Hospital HHT Registry.  ;Although Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) is characterized by an overwhelming bleeding propensity, patients with this disease may also present medical conditions that require antithrombotic therapy (AT). However, precise information on indications, dosage, duration, effectiveness, and safety of AT in HHT patients is lacking. We performed a retrospective analysis of the HHT Registry of our University Hospital and found 26 patients who received AT for a total of 30 courses (19 courses of anticoagulant therapy and 11 courses of antiplatelet therapy). Indications to treatments included: atrial fibrillation, venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, heart valve replacement, retinal artery occlusion, secondary prevention after either stroke or myocardial infarction, and thromboprophylaxis for surgery. The total time of exposure to antiplatelet therapy was 385 months and to anticoagulant therapy 169 months. AT was generally well tolerated, with no fatal bleedings and no significant changes in hemoglobin levels. However, we found three major bleedings, with an incidence rate of 6.5 per 100 patients per year. When only patients treated with anticoagulants were considered, the incidence rate of major bleedings increased to 21.6 per 100 patients per year. Our study indicates that major bleeding may occur in HHT patients receiving AT, with a substantially increased rate in those treated with anticoagulants. Further studies are needed to fully estimate the tolerability of antithrombotic drugs in HHT.  
Clinical history and management of bicuspid aortic valve in children and adolescents.  ;Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is one of the most common congenital heart defects in children, adolescents and adults. BAV can occur as an isolated lesion or in association with other congenital heart defects, such as coarctation of the aorta or genetic syndromes like Turner syndrome. Although the majority of long term complications associated with BAV manifest later in life, children and adolescents may present with early onset valvular dysfunction or dilation of the aorta. BAV is a heterogeneous disease with a wide array of presentations at various ages, depending on the degree of aortic valve dysfunction, aortic dilation and presence of associated lesions. Aortic valve stenosis and/or regurgitation are the primary indications for intervention in children and adolescents with BAV. Although a majority of young patients with BAV also have some aortic dilation, interventions on the aorta are very rare during this time frame. Children and adolescents with BAV benefit from comprehensive assessment of their risk profile to determine follow-up surveillance intervals, sports recommendations, and timing of surgical intervention. The morphologic phenotype of BAV is important to identify, as it may predict future complications and prognosis.  
Echocardiographic screening to determine progression of latent rheumatic heart disease in endemic areas: A systematic review and meta-analysis.  ;"BACKGROUND: The World Health Organisation previously recommended routine screening in school-aged children in countries with a high prevalence of rheumatic heart disease (RHD); however, it is unclear if screening-detected (latent) valve disease will inevitably evolve to a pathological lesion. Understanding the natural history of latent RHD is essential prior to recommendation of screening in endemic areas. Studies documenting the progression of latent RHD have had contrasting conclusions about the pathogenicity of latent valvular lesions. This review provides estimates of rates of progression of latent RHD. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched EMBASE, MEDLINE, Global Index Medicus, Africa Wide, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Global Health Database for studies published before April 30, 2019. Study data were extracted from all studies which reported follow-up data on progression of latent valve lesions. Studies with control cohorts were used to calculate comparative prevalence ratios. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42019119427. We identified 12 studies reporting follow-up data on latent RHD for 950 people in 9 countries. The estimated pooled prevalence rate for progression per year of latent RHD was 5%/year (95% CI 2-8). Eight studies reported on the progression of borderline latent RHD with an estimated pooled prevalence of 2%/year (95% CI 0-4). Three studies included control groups. There was a significant increase in the risk of progression of valvular disease in the latent group compared with controls (RR = 3.57 (95%CI = 1.65-7.70, P = 0.001). The overall risk of bias was low. Given most studies included penicillin administration we were unable to document the natural history of latent RHD. Furthermore, we were unable to perform a sensitivity analysis to determine the effect of administering penicillin prophylaxis on progression of valve disease given prescription of penicillin was not standardised. CONCLUSION: Latent RHD has a slow rate of progression but it is significantly higher compared to controls, with definite latent RHD having a higher rate of progression compared with borderline latent disease. There are a massive number of individuals at risk for RHD in the developing world as well as logistical challenges of screening and delivering penicillin prophylaxis. The low rate of progression from untargeted screening may be an important consideration in resource-constrained environments.  "
[Therapeutic revolution in the treatment of aortic stenosis : transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI )].  ;Eighteen years after the birth of the concept, TAVI (Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation) has established itself as the treatment of choice for symptomatic patients with severe aortic valve stenosis at high surgical risk. Unlike surgical prosthesis, the benefit of which has been validated in observational studies, indications for TAVI are now based on the results of large randomized trials. The TAVI revolution continues today with the miniaturization of the equipment, the development of new closure systems, the availability of a wider range of prosthesis sizes and the growing experience of operators, all contributing to the widening of indications to lower risk patients.  
A Novel Aortic Regurgitation Model from Cusp Prolapse with Hemodynamic Validation Using an Ex Vivo Left Heart Simulator.  ;Although ex vivo simulation is a valuable tool for surgical optimization, a disease model that mimics human aortic regurgitation (AR) from cusp prolapse is needed to accurately examine valve biomechanics. To simulate AR, four porcine aortic valves were explanted, and the commissure between the two largest leaflets was detached and re-implanted 5 mm lower to induce cusp prolapse. Four additional valves were tested in their native state as controls. All valves were tested in a heart simulator while hemodynamics, high-speed videography, and echocardiography data were collected. Our AR model successfully reproduced cusp prolapse with significant increase in regurgitant volume compared with that of the controls (23.2 ± 8.9 versus 2.8 ± 1.6 ml, p = 0.017). Hemodynamics data confirmed the simulation of physiologic disease conditions. Echocardiography and color flow mapping demonstrated the presence of mild to moderate eccentric regurgitation in our AR model. This novel AR model has enormous potential in the evaluation of valve biomechanics and surgical repair techniques. Graphical Abstract.  
Effect of Treprostinil on the Early Postoperative Prognosis of Patients with Severe Left Heart Valvular Disease Combined with Severe Pulmonary Hypertension.  ;OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of treprostinil on the early postoperative prognosis of patients with severe left heart valvular disease combined with severe pulmonary hypertension (PAH). METHODS: A retrospective study including 55 patients with severe left heart valvular disease combined with severe PAH who underwent left heart valve replacement in our hospital between January 2019 and May 2019 was conducted. Patients were divided into two groups (treprostinil group and control group), and the clinical data of patients in the two groups were compared and analyzed. RESULTS: Compared with the preoperative status, the mean postoperative pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) in both groups was significantly lower. Compared with the control group, the treprostinil group had a significantly lower mPAP. Moreover, the postoperative mechanical ventilation time, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and hospital stay of the treprostinil group were significantly shorter than those of the control group. There were no serious drug-related side effects in either group. CONCLUSIONS: Treprostinil can improve the early postoperative prognosis of patients with severe left heart valvular disease combined with severe PAH undergoing prosthetic valve replacement.

Heart Valve Dysfunction in Ischemic Heart Disease: Epiphenomenon of Cardiac Aging and Damage?  ;DOI: 10.1016/j.cjca.2020.02.099 PMID: 32492402  
Economic assessment of traditional surgical valve replacement versus use of transfemoral intervention in degenerative aortic stenosis.  ;OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to provide an economic assessment of interventional vs. surgical aortic valve replacement in the context of cost-effectiveness. BACKGROUND: Aortic stenosis represents the most common form of degenerative valvular heart diseases. As life expectancy increases, an even emerging prevalence is expected. Over decades, surgical replacement was considered as the method of choice. Up to one third of the patients were not eligible for surgery, as their estimated peri- operative risk was too high. In the early 2000s a catheter-based technique has been developed, being an alternative treatment option for patients, considered to be inoperable. Recently the Food and Drug Association (FDA) approved transcatheter replacement (TAVR) in the low risk setting. Nevertheless, concerns on the higher price remain. METHODS: We performed an analysis of current literature on aortic stenosis and economic aspects. Out of 322 screened publications, 7 studies were found eligible by expert hand selection. RESULTS: Based on the predefined payment readiness of the analyzed healthcare system, TAVR appeared to have a slightly better cost effectiveness. Initial results within the early era seemed to be inconsistent. Recent publications showed, TAVR might be of more cost effectiveness when using the newest generation devices and a profound clinical experience is guaranteed. CONCLUSIONS: We assume, that TAVR will not only be the method of choice for the treatment of aortic stenosis in many patients. As the valves are getting cheaper, TAVR might even be superior to conventional heart surgery from an economic point of view.

The Prevalence of Congenital Heart Diseases in Syndromic Children at King Khalid National Guard Hospital from 2005 to 2016.  ;Background Congenital heart diseases (CHDs) are abnormalities that present in the heart since birth and are one of the leading causes of infant mortality in the world. CHDs are more common among children with dysmorphic syndromes. The current study aims to estimate the prevalence of many CHDs in different dysmorphic syndromes. Methods This was a retrospective chart review study conducted on all dysmorphic syndrome patients who attended genetic clinics at King Khalid National Guard Hospital in King Abdulaziz Medical City (KAMC), Jeddah, Saudi Arabia from 2005 to 2016. Dysmorphic pediatric patients less than 14 years old who had genetic testing to confirm their diagnosis were included in the study. Patients who did not have any previous echocardiography were excluded. Results A total of 212 individuals (47% males and 53% females) were included. Eighty-five percent of Down syndrome patients had CHDs, and the most common CHD was an atrial septal defect (ASD) (51%). In patients with Turner syndrome, 45% of them had CHDs, and bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) (40%) was the most common defect. In DiGeorge syndrome, 81% of patients had CHDs, and ventricular septal defect (VSD) (41%) was the most common. In Williams syndrome, 83% of patients had CHDs. All patients with Noonan, Edwards, CHARGE (coloboma, heart defects, atresia choanae (also known as choanal atresia), growth retardation, genital abnormalities, and ear abnormalities), and Rubinstein-Taybi syndromes were found to have CHDs. In Patau syndrome and Joubert syndrome, 50% of patients in each had CHDs. Patients with Prader Willi syndrome had normal findings in the echocardiogram. Conclusion The highest prevalence of CHDs was found in Down syndrome. This study has a significant impact on the future of managing and directing the resources to improve the quality of life for syndromic patients. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings and to increase the local data in the field of CHDs in Saudi Arabia among syndromic patients.  
Heart failure patients have enhanced cerebral autoregulation response in acute ischemic stroke.  ;The cerebrovascular effects of a failing heart-pump are largely unknown. Chronic heart failure (HF) might cause pre-conditioning effect on cerebral hemodynamics but not study so far in acute stroke. We aimed to investigate if HF induces effects in dynamic cerebral autoregulation (CA), within 6 h of symptom-onset through chronic stage of ischemic stroke. We enrolled 50 patients with acute ischemic stroke. Groups with (N = 8) and without HF and 20 heathy controls were compared. Arterial blood pressure (Finometer) and cerebral blood flow velocity (transcranial Doppler) were monitored within 6 and at 24 h from symptom-onset and at 3 months. We assessed dynamic CA by transfer function analysis and cardiac disease markers. HF associated with higher phase (better dynamic CA) at ischemic hemisphere within 6 (p = 0.042) and at 24 h (p = 0.006) but this effect was not evident at 3 months (p > 0.05). Gain and coherence trends were similar between groups. We found a positive correlation between phase and admission troponin I levels (Spearman's r = 0.348, p = 0.044). Our findings advances on the knowledge of how brain and heart interact in acute ischemic stroke by showing a sustained dynamic cerebral autoregulation response in HF patients mainly with severe aortic valve disease. Understanding the physiological mechanisms that govern this complex interplay can be useful to find novel therapeutic targets which can improve outcome in ischemic stroke.  
The diagnostic benefit of 16S rDNA PCR examination of infective endocarditis heart valves: a cohort study of 146 surgical cases confirmed by histopathology.  ;"AIMS: Upon suspicion of infective endocarditis, the causative microorganism must be identified to optimize treatment. Blood cultures and culturing of removed valves are the mainstay of this diagnosis and should be complemented by growth-independent methods. We assessed the diagnostic benefit of examining removed endocarditis valves by broad-range bacterial PCR to detect causative bacteria in cases where culturing was not available, negative, or inconclusive because a skin commensal was detected, in patients from our clinical routine practice. METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients from Heidelberg University Hospital with suspicion of endocarditis, followed by valve replacement and analysis by 16S rDNA PCR, between 2015 and 2018, were evaluated. 146 patients with definite infective endocarditis, confirmed by the valve macroscopics and/or histology, were included. Valve PCRs were compared to corresponding blood and valve culture results. Overall, valve PCR yielded an additional diagnostic benefit in 34 of 146 cases (23%) and was found to be more sensitive than valve culture. In 19 of 38 patients with both negative blood and valve cultures, valve PCR was the only method rendering a pathogen. In 23 patients with positive blood cultures detecting skin commensals, 4 patients showed discordant valve PCR results, detecting a more plausible pathogen, and in 11 of 23 cases, valve PCR confirmed commensals in blood culture as true pathogens. Only the remaining 8 patients had negative valve PCRs. CONCLUSION: Valve PCR was found to be a valuable diagnostic tool in surgical endocarditis cases with negative blood cultures or positive blood cultures of unknown significance. TRIAL REGISTRATION: S-440/2017 on 28.08.2017 retrospectively registered. Subdividing of all infective endocarditis patients in this study, showing that valve PCR yields valuable information for patients with skin commensals in blood cultures, which were either confirmed by the same detection in valve PCR or refuted by the detection of a different and typical pathogen in valve PCR. Additionally, benefit was determined in patients with negative or not available blood cultures and only positive detection in valve PCR. +: Positive; -: negative; n/a: not available results.  "
Continuous-Flow Left Ventricular Assist Devices and the Aortic Valve: Interactions, Issues, and Surgical Therapy.  ;PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Concomitant valve disease is common in patients undergoing continuous-flow left ventricular assist device (CF-LVAD) implantation. In this review, we characterize the epidemiology and management of aortic valve disease following CF-LVAD. RECENT FINDINGS: Studies suggest that 20-40% of patients have mild or greater aortic insufficiency (AI) at baseline and that AI progresses following CF-LVAD implantation. AI, either pre-existing or de novo, can have deleterious effects on LVAD efficacy and clinical outcomes. Surgical methods to correct AI in patients supported with CF-LVAD include central oversewing of the aortic valve, complete closure of the aortic valve, patch closure of the ventriculo-aortic junction, or aortic valve replacement with a bioprosthesis. Transcatheter options have recently emerged as feasible modalities to address AI. CF-LVADs contribute to the progression of aortic insufficiency (AI) and its development de novo. Prompt recognition, assessment, and treatment are important. Aortic valve repairs and replacements, now including TAVR, are the primary surgical methods to correct AI.  
Epigenetics of paraoxonases.  ;PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Studies have shown the three-member paraoxonase (PON) multigene family to be involved in the development of a large variety of diseases with an inflammatory component. Environmental factors such as lifestyle-related factors differ widely between populations and it is important to consider that their impacts may be exerted through the epigenetic mechanisms, which connect genes, the environment and disease development and are a potential therapeutic avenue. RECENT FINDINGS: In the review period, very little was published on epigenetics of PON2 or PON3, mostly on their diagnostic value in cancer by measuring methylation levels of these genes. However, the picture is more promising with PON1. Here, several studies have linked the epigenetic regulation of PON1 to various metabolic processes and particularly to the development of several diseases, including stroke, heart disease, aortic valve stenosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. SUMMARY: Studies into the epigenetic regulation of the PON family are in their infancy. However, recent studies linking epigenetic regulation of PON1 to disease development will encourage further research and open up the possibility for new potential therapeutic interventions.  
Survival, Morbidities, and Developmental Outcomes among Low Birth Weight Infants with Congenital Heart Defects.  ;"OBJECTIVE:  Prematurity and low birth weight (LBW) are risk factors for increased morbidity and mortality in infants with congenital heart defects (CHDs). We sought to describe survival, inhospital morbidities, and 2-year neurodevelopmental follow-up in LBW infants with CHD. STUDY DESIGN:  We included infants with birth weight (BW) <2,500 g diagnosed with CHD (except isolated patent ductus arteriosus) admitted January 2013 to March 2016 to a single level-IV academic neonatal intensive care unit. We reported CHD prevalence by BW and gestational age; selected in-hospital morbidities and mortality by infant BW, CHD type, and surgical intervention; and developmental outcomes by Bayley's scales of infant and toddler development, third edition (BSID-III) scores at age 2 years. RESULTS:  Among 420 infants with CHD, 28 (7%) underwent cardiac surgery. Median (25th and 75th percentiles) gestational age was 30 (range: 27-33) weeks and BW was 1,258 (range: 870-1,853) g. There were 134 of 420 (32%) extremely LBW (<1,000 g) infants, 82 of 420 (20%) were small for gestational age, and 51 of 420 (12%) multiples. Most common diagnosis: atrial septal defect (260/420, 62%), followed by congenital anomaly of the pulmonary valve (75/420, 18%). Most common surgical procedure: pulmonary artery banding (5/28, 18%), followed by the tetralogy of Fallot corrective repair (4/28, 14%). Survival to discharge was 88% overall and lower among extremely LBW (<1,000 g, 81%) infants and infants undergoing surgery (79%). Comorbidities were common (35%); retinopathy of prematurity and bronchopulmonary dysplasia were most prevalent. BSID-III scores were available on 148 of 176 (84%); any scores <85 were noted in 73 of 148 (49%), with language being most commonly affected. CONCLUSION:  Among LBW infants with congenital heart disease, hospital mortality varied by BW and cardiac diagnosis. KEY POINTS: · In low birth weight infants with congenital heart disease, survival varied by birth weight and cardiac diagnosis.. · Overall survival was higher than previously reported.. · There were fewer morbidities than previously reported.. · Bayley's scale-III scores at 2 years of age were <85 for nearly half..

Clinical presentation and outcomes of adults with bicuspid aortic valves: 2020 update.  ;The congenital bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is a heterogeneous condition that is better understood considering 3 types of valvulo-aortopathy presentations: A typical-presentation valvulo-aortopathy, a complex-presentation valvulo-aortopathy and an uncomplicated/undiagnosed-presentation. The burden of BAV-related complications has been elucidated in patients with the typical-presentation valvulo-aortopathy and is discussed in this review. These patients enjoy an overall normal expected long-term survival as long as complications are identified and treated in a timely manner. This notion and the fact that the most dreaded complications (infective endocarditis and aortic dissection) are infrequent, represent important reassuring points for the BAV patient. Common complications such as valve dysfunction and aorta dilatation must be the subject of focused research in prevention and treatment. Conversely, BAV patients with complex-presentation valvulo-artopathy, as well as typical valvulo-aortopathy BAV patients who are older, with advanced valvular dysfunction, and possible late-referral to specialized care, may incur a survival penalty as compared to the general population. An evidence-based discussion of these concepts is provided in this review.  
Differential microRNAs expression in calcified versus rheumatic aortic valve disease.  ;BACKGROUND: The aortic valve (AV) is the most commonly affected valve in valvular heart diseases (VHDs). The objective of the study is to identify microRNA (miRNA) molecules expressed in VHDs and the differential expression patterns of miRNA in AVs with either calcification or rheumatism etiologies. METHODS: Human AVs were collected during valve replacement surgery. RNA was extracted and miRNA containing libraries were prepared and sequenced using the next generation sequencing (NGS) approach. miRNAs identified as differentially expressed between the two etiologies were validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to examine the ability of relevant miRNA to differentiate between calcification and rheumatism etiologies. RESULTS: Rheumatic and calcified AV samples were prepared for the NGS and were successfully sequenced. The expression was validated by the qPCR approach in 46 AVs, 13 rheumatic, and 33 calcified AVs, confirming that miR-145-5p, miR-199a-5p, and miR-5701 were significantly higher in rheumatic AVs as compared with calcified AVs. ROC curve analysis revealed that miR-145-5p had a sensitivity of 76.92% and a specificity of 94.12%, area under the curve (AUC) = 0.88 (P = .0001), and miR-5701 had a sensitivity of 84.62% and a specificity of 76.47%, AUC = 0.78 (P = .0001), whereas miR-199a-5p had a sensitivity of 84.62%, and a specificity of 57.58%, AUC = 0.73 (P = .0083). CONCLUSION: We documented differential miRNA expression between AV disease etiologies. The miRNAs identified in this study advance our understanding of the mechanisms underlining AV disease.  
Tricuspid atresia: Where are we now?  ;Tricuspid atresia (TA) is a complex congenital heart disease that presents with cyanosis in the neonatal period. It is invariably fatal if left untreated and requires multiple stages of palliation. Early recognition and timely surgical intervention are therefore pivotal in the management of these infants. This literature review considers the pathophysiology, presentation, investigations, and classification of TA. Moreover, it discusses the evidence upon which the latest medical and surgical treatments are based, as well as numerous recent case reports. Further work is needed to elucidate the etiology of TA, clarify the role of pharmacotherapy, and optimize the surgical management that these patients receive.  
Managing Severe Aortic Stenosis in the COVID-19 Era.  ;The novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has created uncertainty in the management of patients with severe aortic stenosis. This population experiences high mortality from delays in treatment of valve disease but is largely overlapping with the population of highest mortality from COVID-19. The authors present strategies for managing patients with severe aortic stenosis in the COVID-19 era. The authors suggest transitions to virtual assessments and consultation, careful pruning and planning of necessary testing, and fewer and shorter hospital admissions. These strategies center on minimizing patient exposure to COVID-19 and expenditure of human and health care resources without significant sacrifice to patient outcomes during this public health emergency. Areas of innovation to improve care during this time include increased use of wearable and remote devices to assess patient performance and vital signs, devices for facile cardiac assessment, and widespread use of clinical protocols for expedient discharge with virtual physical therapy and cardiac rehabilitation options.  
Real-time Detection of Aortic Valve in Echocardiography using Convolutional Neural Networks.  ;BACKGROUND: Valvular heart disease is a serious disease leading to mortality and increasing medical care cost. The aortic valve is the most common valve affected by this disease. Doctors rely on echocardiogram for diagnosing and evaluating valvular heart disease. However, the images from echocardiogram are poor in comparison to Computerized Tomography and Magnetic Resonance Imaging scan. This study proposes the development of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) that can function optimally during a live echocardiographic examination for detection of the aortic valve. An automated detection system in an echocardiogram will improve the accuracy of medical diagnosis and can provide further medical analysis from the resulting detection. METHODS: Two detection architectures, Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD) and Faster Regional based Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN) with various feature extractors were trained on echocardiography images from 33 patients. Thereafter, the models were tested on 10 echocardiography videos. RESULTS: Faster R-CNN Inception v2 had shown the highest accuracy (98.6%) followed closely by SSD Mobilenet v2. In terms of speed, SSD Mobilenet v2 resulted in a loss of 46.81% in framesper- second (fps) during real-time detection but managed to perform better than the other neural network models. Additionally, SSD Mobilenet v2 used the least amount of Graphic Processing Unit (GPU) but the Central Processing Unit (CPU) usage was relatively similar throughout all models. CONCLUSION: Our findings provide a foundation for implementing a convolutional detection system to echocardiography for medical purposes.  
Red Meat Allergies after Lone Star Tick (Amblyomma americanum) Bites.  ;"Red meat allergies have followed tick bites on every continent except Antarctica. The sensitizing antigen is galactose-α-1,3-galactose (α-gal), an oligosaccharide constituent of nonprimate blood and meat, acquired by ticks during animal bloodfeeding. Because red meat allergy after tick bites is a worldwide phenomenon, the objectives of this review were to describe the global epidemiology of red meat allergy after tick bites and its immunological mechanisms; to identify the human risk factors for red meat allergy after tick bites; to identify the most common tick vectors of red meat allergy worldwide; to describe the clinical manifestations, diagnostic confirmation, and management of patients with red meat allergy after tick bites; and to recommend strategies for the prevention of tick bites. To meet these objectives, Internet search engines were queried with keywords to select scientific articles for review. The keywords included ticks, tick bites, allergy, anaphylaxis, and meat allergy. The study period was defined as 1980-2019. The major risk factors for red meat allergy after tick bites included male sex, non-B blood type, systemic mastocytosis, a bioprosthetic (bovine or porcine) heart valve, and preexisting allergies to gelatin or animal dander. Following confirmation by challenge testing, patients with red meat allergies should avoid red meats, foods containing gelatin, and intravenous immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies such as cetuximab and infliximab produced in SP2/0 mouse cell lines. Red meat allergy after tick bites represents an emerging threat from tick bites in addition to infectious diseases.  "
Expanding the clinical and genetic spectrum of ALPK3 variants: Phenotypes identified in pediatric cardiomyopathy patients and adults with heterozygous variants.  ;"INTRODUCTION: Biallelic damaging variants in ALPK3, encoding alpha-protein kinase 3, cause pediatric-onset cardiomyopathy with manifestations that are incompletely defined. METHODS AND RESULTS: We analyzed clinical manifestations of damaging biallelic ALPK3 variants in 19 pediatric patients, including nine previously published cases. Among these, 11 loss-of-function (LoF) variants, seven compound LoF and deleterious missense variants, and one homozygous deleterious missense variant were identified. Among 18 live-born patients, 8 exhibited neonatal dilated cardiomyopathy (44.4%; 95% CI: 21.5%-69.2%) that subsequently transitioned into ventricular hypertrophy. The majority of patients had extracardiac phenotypes, including contractures, scoliosis, cleft palate, and facial dysmorphisms. We observed no association between variant type or location, disease severity, and/or extracardiac manifestations. Myocardial histopathology showed focal cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, subendocardial fibroelastosis in patients under 4 years of age, and myofibrillar disarray in adults. Rare heterozygous ALPK3 variants were also assessed in adult-onset cardiomyopathy patients. Among 1548 Dutch patients referred for initial genetic analyses, we identified 39 individuals with rare heterozygous ALPK3 variants (2.5%; 95% CI: 1.8%-3.4%), including 26 missense and 10 LoF variants. Among 149 U.S. patients without pathogenic variants in 83 cardiomyopathy-related genes, we identified six missense and nine LoF ALPK3 variants (10.1%; 95% CI: 5.7%-16.1%). LoF ALPK3 variants were increased in comparison to matched controls (Dutch cohort, P = 1.6×10-5; U.S. cohort, P = 2.2×10-13). CONCLUSION: Biallelic damaging ALPK3 variants cause pediatric cardiomyopathy manifested by DCM transitioning to hypertrophy, often with poor contractile function. Additional extracardiac features occur in most patients, including musculoskeletal abnormalities and cleft palate. Heterozygous LoF ALPK3 variants are enriched in adults with cardiomyopathy and may contribute to their cardiomyopathy. Adults with ALPK3 LoF variants therefore warrant evaluations for cardiomyopathy.  "
Characterization of interstitial diffuse fibrosis patterns using texture analysis of myocardial native T1 mapping.  ;BACKGROUND: The pattern of myocardial fibrosis differs significantly between different cardiomyopathies. Fibrosis in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is characteristically as patchy and regional but in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) as diffuse and global. We sought to investigate if texture analyses on myocardial native T1 mapping can differentiate between fibrosis patterns in patients with HCM and DCM. METHODS: We prospectively acquired native myocardial T1 mapping images for 321 subjects (55±15 years, 70% male): 65 control, 116 HCM, and 140 DCM patients. To quantify different fibrosis patterns, four sets of texture descriptors were used to extract 152 texture features from native T1 maps. Seven features were sequentially selected to identify HCM- and DCM-specific patterns in 70% of data (training dataset). Pattern reproducibility and generalizability were tested on the rest of data (testing dataset) using support vector machines (SVM) and regression models. RESULTS: Pattern-derived texture features were capable to identify subjects in HCM, DCM, and controls cohorts with 202/237(85.2%) accuracy of all subjects in the training dataset using 10-fold cross-validation on SVM (AUC = 0.93, 0.93, and 0.93 for controls, HCM and DCM, respectively), while pattern-independent global native T1 mapping was poorly capable to identify those subjects with 121/237(51.1%) accuracy (AUC = 0.78, 0.51, and 0.74) (P<0.001 for all). The pattern-derived features were reproducible with excellent intra- and inter-observer reliability and generalizable on the testing dataset with 75/84(89.3%) accuracy. CONCLUSION: Texture analysis of myocardial native T1 mapping can characterize fibrosis patterns in HCM and DCM patients and provides additional information beyond average native T1 values.  
Characteristics and Outcomes of Patients Who Are Denied From a Percutaneous Edge-to-Edge Mitral Valve Repair After Being Referred to a Transcatheter Mitral Valve Program: Impact of a Dedicated Multidisciplinary Mitral Heart Team Approach.  ;BACKGROUND: Many patients referred for a MitraClip intervention are finally refused for this intervention, and data are very scarce on their outcomes. Our study sought to determine the characteristics and outcomes of patients who are referred to a mitral valve clinic and are finally denied from a percutaneous mitral edge-to-edge repair. METHODS: A total of 210 patients referred to our clinic for severe mitral regurgitation were retrospectively analyzed. Fifty-seven patients underwent a MitraClip procedure. For exploratory purposes, a propensity-matched cohort comparing the patients accepted for a MitraClip procedure and those refused for any mitral intervention was analyzed. RESULTS: Among the 153 patients who were refused for MitraClip, 46% had functional MR, 42% had degenerative MR, and 11% had mixed disease. Reasons for denial included unfavorable anatomy, patient refusal, mitral valve surgery referral, cardiac resynchronization therapy, other advanced heart failure therapies, and palliative care. After a mean follow-up of 13 months, 50% were in New York Heart Association class I or II, 63% had less than severe MR, and mortality rate was 29%. In the propensity-matched cohort, there was no difference in symptoms improvement, but there was less overall mortality (P=.01), cardiovascular mortality (P<.01) and severe MR (P<.01) in the MitraClip group. CONCLUSIONS: A multidisciplinary heart team evaluation for complex MR patients can be useful not solely for selecting the ideal MitraClip eligible patients, but also to select the best treatment strategy in each individualized context.  
Lipoprotein(a) in Alzheimer, Atherosclerotic, Cerebrovascular, Thrombotic, and Valvular Disease: Mendelian Randomization Investigation.  ;DOI: 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.120.045826 PMID: 32479194  
Mitral valve perforation during transcatheter aortic valve replacement.  ;An 86-year-old female with severe aortic valve stenosis underwent transcatheter aortic valve replacement. A balloon-expandable valve was used, guided by a double-stiff guidewire that successfully straightened the aorta. During valve placement, the balloon shifted. After placement of the prosthetic valve, intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography revealed severe mitral regurgitation from the anterior mitral leaflet. Open conversion was performed immediately. A 5-mm hole was identified in the anterior leaflet, and direct closure was chosen for mitral valve repair. While transcatheter aortic valve replacement has gained popularity for patients with severe aortic stenosis and high operative risk, reports of mitral valve perforation are rare.  
Calcific Aortic Valve Disease-Natural History and Future Therapeutic Strategies.  ;Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is the most frequent heart valve disorder. It is characterized by an active remodeling process accompanied with valve mineralization, that results in a progressive aortic valve narrowing, significant restriction of the valvular area, and impairment of blood flow.The pathophysiology of CAVD is a multifaceted process, involving genetic factors, chronic inflammation, lipid deposition, and valve mineralization. Mineralization is strictly related to the inflammatory process in which both, innate, and adaptive immunity are involved. The underlying pathophysiological pathways that go from inflammation to calcification and, finally lead to severe stenosis, remain, however, incompletely understood. Histopathological studies are limited to patients with severe CAVD and no samples are available for longitudinal studies of disease progression. Therefore, alternative routes should be explored to investigate the pathogenesis and progression of CAVD.Recently, increasing evidence suggests that epigenetic markers such as non-coding RNAs are implicated in the landscape of phenotypical changes occurring in CAVD. Furthermore, the microbiome, an essential player in several diseases, including the cardiovascular ones, has recently been linked to the inflammation process occurring in CAVD. In the present review, we analyze and discuss the CAVD pathophysiology and future therapeutic strategies, focusing on the real and putative role of inflammation, calcification, and microbiome.  
"[Surgical Repair without Ventriculotomy for Double-chambered Right Ventricle in a 61-year-old Man;Report of a Case].  ";A 61-year-old man with double-chambered right ventricle( DCRV) was operated on successfully without ventriculotomy. The patient presented with cardiac murmur and electrocardiogram abnormality with exertional dyspnea. Echocardiography demonstrated double-chambered right ventricle with severe tricuspid valve regurgitation. Cardiac catheterization data revealed a 110 mmHg peak-to-peak pressure gradient in the right ventricular cavity with normal pulmonary pressure. The tricuspid valve was repaired with an annuloplasty ring, and the abnormal muscle bands in right ventricular outflow tract were resected through both right atrium and pulmonary artery. No major complications occurred after surgery. Postoperative echocardiography demonstrated a pressure gradient of 18 mmHg between the pulmonary artery and right ventricle without tricuspid regurgitation, and his clinical symptoms were improved. Surgical repair without right ventriculotomy combined with tricuspid annuloplasty was effective and feasible for DCRV in an adult patient.  
Cardiac structural changes after transcatheter aortic valve replacement: systematic review and meta-analysis of cardiovascular magnetic resonance studies.  ;BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is increasingly used to treat patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS). Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) provides reliable and reproducible estimates for assessment of cardiac structure and function after TAVR. The goal of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature to assess left ventricular (LV) volumes, mass and function by CMR after TAVR. METHODS: Using Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines, we searched PubMed and Embase for studies reporting CMR findings before and at least 1 month after TAVR. Main factors of interest were LV end-diastolic volume index (LVEDVi), LV end-systolic volume index (LVESVi), LV mass index (LVMi), and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Standardized mean differences (SMD) were pooled by random effects meta-analytic techniques. RESULTS: Of 453 screened publications, 10 studies (published between 2012 and 2018) were included. A total of 305 patients completed pre- and post-TAVR follow-up CMR (mean age range 78.6-85.0 years, follow-up range 6-15 months). Random effects analysis showed TAVR resulted in reduced LVEDVi (SMD: -0.25, 95% CI: - 0.43 to - 0.07, P = 0.006), LVESVi (SMD: -0.24, 95% CI: - 0.44 to - 0.05, P = 0.01), LVMi (SMD: -0.82, 95% CI: - 1.0 to - 0.63, P < 0.001) and increased LVEF (SMD: 22, 95% CI: 6 to 38%, P = 0.006). Heterogeneity across studies was low (I2: 0%, Pheterogeneity > 0.05 for all). The median reduction was 4 ml/m2 (IQR: 3.1 to 8.2) for LVEDVi, 5 ml/m2 (IQR: 3.0 to 6.0) for LVESVi, and 15.1 g/m2 (IQR: 11.8 to 18.3) for LVMi. The median increase for LVEF was 3.4% (IQR 1.0 to 4.6%). CONCLUSIONS: CMR demonstrates reverse LV remodeling occurrs within 6-15 months after TAVR, with reductions in LVEDVi, LVESVi and LVMi, and increased LVEF.  
Right and left ventricle native T1 mapping in systolic phase in patients with congenital heart disease.  ;BACKGROUND: T1 mapping is emerging as a powerful tool in cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) to evaluate diffuse fibrosis. However, right ventricular (RV) T1 mapping proves difficult due to the limited wall thickness in diastolic phase. Several studies focused on systolic T1 mapping, albeit only on the left ventricle (LV). PURPOSE: To estimate intra- and inter-observer variability of native T1 (nT1) mapping of the RV, and its correlations with biventricular and pulmonary function in patients with congenital heart disease (CHD). MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this retrospective, observational, cross-sectional study we evaluated 36 patients with CHD, having undergone CMR on a 1.5-T scanner. LV and RV functional evaluations were performed. A native modified look-locker inversion recovery short-axis sequence was acquired in the systolic phase. Intra- and inter-reader reproducibility were reported as complement to 100% of the ratio between coefficient of reproducibility and mean. Spearman ρ and Mann-Whitney U-test were used to compare distributions. RESULTS: Intra- and inter-reader reproducibility was 84% and 82%, respectively. Median nT1 was 1022 ms (interquartile range [IQR] 1108-972) for the RV and 947 ms (IQR 986-914) for the LV. Median RV-nT1 was 1016 ms (IQR 1090-1016) in patients with EDVI ≤100 mL/m2 and 1100 ms (IQR 1113-1100) in patients with EDVI >100 mL/m2 (P = 0.049). A significant negative correlation was found between RV ejection fraction and RV-nT1 (ρ = -0.284, P = 0.046). CONCLUSION: Systolic RV-nT1 showed a high reproducibility and a negative correlation with RV ejection fraction, potentially reflecting an adaptation of the RV myocardium to pulmonary valve/conduit (dys)-function.  
The Compensatory Reserve Index Responds to Acute Hemodynamic Changes in Patients with Congenital Heart Disease: A Proof of Concept Study.  ;Patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) who undergo cardiac procedures may become hemodynamically unstable. Predictive algorithms that utilize dense physiologic data may be useful. The compensatory reserve index (CRI) trends beat-to-beat progression from normovolemia (CRI = 1) to decompensation (CRI = 0) in hemorrhagic shock by continuously analyzing unique sets of features in the changing pulse photoplethysmogram (PPG) waveform. We sought to understand if the CRI accurately reflects changing hemodynamics during and after a cardiac procedure for patients with CHD. A transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement (TcPVR) model was used because left ventricular stroke volume decreases upon sizing balloon occlusion of the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) and increases after successful valve placement. A single-center, prospective cohort study was performed. The CRI was continuously measured to determine the change in CRI before and after RVOT occlusion and successful TcPVR. Twenty-six subjects were enrolled with a median age of 19 (interquartile range (IQR) 13-29) years. The mean (± standard deviation) CRI decreased from 0.66 ± 0.15 1-min before balloon inflation to 0.53 ± 0.16 (p = 0.03) 1-min after balloon deflation. The mean CRI increased from a pre-valve mean CRI of 0.63 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.56-0.70] to 0.77 (95% CI 0.71-0.83) after successful TcPVR. In this study, the CRI accurately reflected acute hemodynamic changes associated with TcPVR. Further research is justified to determine if the CRI can be useful as an early warning tool in patients with CHD at risk for decompensation during and after cardiac procedures.  
The INVICTUS rheumatic heart disease research program: Rationale, design and baseline characteristics of a randomized trial of rivaroxaban compared to vitamin K antagonists in rheumatic valvular disease and atrial fibrillation.  ;BACKGROUND: Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) is a neglected disease affecting 33 million people, mainly in low and middle income countries. Yet very few large trials or registries have been conducted in this population. The INVICTUS program of research in RHD consists of a randomized-controlled trial (RCT) of 4500 patients comparing rivaroxaban with vitamin K antagonists (VKA) in patients with RHD and atrial fibrillation (AF), a registry of 17,000 patients to document the contemporary clinical course of patients with RHD, including a focused sub-study on pregnant women with RHD within the registry. This paper describes the rationale, design, organization and baseline characteristics of the RCT and a summary of the design of the registry and its sub-study. Patients with RHD and AF are considered to be at high risk of embolic strokes, and oral anticoagulation with VKAs is recommended for stroke prevention. But the quality of anticoagulation with VKA is poor in developing countries. A drug which does not require monitoring, and which is safe and effective for preventing stroke in patients with valvular AF, would fulfill a major unmet need. METHODS: The INVestIgation of rheumatiC AF Treatment Using VKAs, rivaroxaban or aspirin Studies (INVICTUS-VKA) trial is an international, multicentre, randomized, open-label, parallel group trial, testing whether rivaroxaban 20 mg given once daily is non-inferior (or superior) to VKA in patients with RHD, AF, and an elevated risk of stroke (mitral stenosis with valve area ≤2 cm2, left atrial spontaneous echo-contrast or thrombus, or a CHA2DS2VASc score ≥2). The primary efficacy outcome is a composite of stroke or systemic embolism and the primary safety outcome is the occurrence of major bleeding. The trial has enrolled 4565 patients from 138 sites in 23 countries from Africa, Asia and South America. The Registry plans to enroll an additional 17,000 patients with RHD and document their treatments, and their clinical course for at least 2 years. The pregnancy sub-study will document the clinical course of pregnant women with RHD. CONCLUSION: INVICTUS is the largest program of clinical research focused on a neglected cardiovascular disease and will provide new information on the clinical course of patients with RHD, and approaches to anticoagulation in those with concomitant AF.  
Transcatheter Mitral Valve Repair with MitraClip for Severe Mitral Regurgitation and Cardiogenic Shock During the COVID-19 Pandemic.  ;"Transcatheter mitral valve repair with MitraClip (Abbott) is largely an elective procedure. The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has posed challenges to health care systems; in many cases elective interventions have been curtailed. Patients with severe mitral regurgitation (MR) and cardiogenic shock are high-risk surgical candidates and at risk of a poor outcome without intervention. The American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the Society of Coronary Angiography and Interventions (SCAI) recently proposed joint guidance on triage of structural heart disease (SHD) interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic. We present two illustrative cases of severe MR and cardiogenic shock that were successfully treated with MitraClip amidst the COVID-19 pandemic with good outcomes at short term follow-up.  "
Leaflet Prolapse After BASILICA and Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.  ;DOI: 10.1016/j.jcin.2020.04.016 PMID: 32473886  
Cardiovascular ochronosis.  ;In this review, we summarize previously reported case reports (n=66) in which the presence of ochronotic pigment was found in one or more cardiovascular structures either at necropsy or after operative excision of a cardiac valve or portions of arteries or both. As illustration, we describe black pigment in operatively excised aortic valves and aorta in 2 patients, both probably examples of secondary ochronosis. Ochronosis appears to have fascinated a number of prominent historical figures in medicine, and this review also summarizes their important contributions to this topic.  
Supra-annular sizing of transcatheter aortic valve prostheses in raphe-type bicuspid aortic valve disease: the LIRA method.  ;BACKGROUND: Recent evidence shows that THV prostheses anchoring occurs at the raphe-level, known as LIRA plane, in raphe-type bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) disease. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the application of a novel supra-annular sizing method, known as Level of Implantation at the RAphe (LIRA) method, to optimize transcatheter heart valve (THV) prosthesis sizing in raphe-type BAV disease. METHODS AND RESULTS: The LIRA method was applied to all consecutive patients with raphe-type BAV disease between November 2018 to January 2020 in our centre. THV prostheses were sized on the basis of baseline CT scan perimeters at the LIRA plane and at the virtual basal ring. In case of discrepancy between the two plane measurements, the plane with the smallest perimeter was considered the reference for prosthesis sizing. Post-procedural device success, defined according to Valve Academic Research Consortium-2 (VARC-2) criteria, was evaluated in the overall cohort. 20 patients (mean patient age 81 ± 5.4 years, 70% males) were identified as having a raphe-type BAV disease at pre-procedural CT scans and were implanted with different types of THV prostheses. The LIRA plane method appeared to be highly successful (100% VARC-2 device success) with no procedural mortality, no valve migration, no moderate-severe paravalvular leak and low transprosthetic gradient (residual mean gradient of 8.2 ± 2.9 mm Hg). CONCLUSIONS: Supra-annular sizing according to the LIRA method appeared to be safe with a high device success. The application of the LIRA method might optimize THV prosthesis sizing in patients with raphe-type BAV disease.  
Tricuspid valve geometry in patients with functional tricuspid regurgitation: A three-dimensional echocardiographic study.  ;"INTRODUCTION: Tricuspid valve (TV) has a complex anatomy causing some difficulties in echocardiographic evaluation. In this study, we sought to assess the geometry of TV in patients with functional tricuspid regurgitation (TR) by the implementation of 2- and 3-dimennsional (2D and 3D) echocardiography. METHODS: In a case-control study, the geometrical features of TV were evaluated in forty patients with functional TR using echocardiographic examinations, and those data compared with twenty-five age- and sex-matched healthy individuals. RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 50 ± 12 years, and 75% were female. All echocardiographic features of TV geometry were significantly greater in TR compared to control group. The 3D evaluation of TV annulus showed that the annulus shape was more circular in the TR compared to the control group. When compared patients with moderate and severe TR, there was a significant difference between groups regarding the size of the TV septolateral annulus diameter (3.5 ± 0.4 vs 3.9 ± 0.7 cm; P = .048), and the angle between mitral valve and TV annuluses (12.5 ± 4.3 vs 17 ± 9º; P = .048). Tenting areas measured by 2D echocardiography and obtained by TomTec software were significantly greater in severe TR compared to moderate TR group. The diameter of TV by 2D echocardiography was significantly higher in atrial fibrillation than that in sinus rhythm group among patients with TR. CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of 3D echocardiography is useful in the determination of TV geometry in patients with functional TR. The accurate evaluation of anatomical features of TV might provide valuable tools in the evaluation of patients with functional TR.  "

Multimodality imaging to guide transcatheter treatment of severe degenerative tricuspid regurgitation with tricuspid valve-in-ring implantation and paravalvular leak closure.  ;"Tricuspid valve (TV) degeneration after surgical repair with an annuloplasty ring is problematic as redo operation carries high mortality. This can be addressed with transcatheter therapies to implant a valve within in prior ring (tricuspid valve-in-ring). When an incomplete ring is present, paravalvular leak is commonly encountered after tricuspid valve-in-ring (TViR) implant; however, this can be addressed with paravalvular leak closure devices. Multimodality imaging including cardiac computed tomography and three-dimensional (3D) transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) are important for successful TViR implant. We report a case of tricuspid regurgitation after tricuspid repair with an incomplete annuloplasty ring and subsequent paravalvular leak closure.  "
Heart failure in the adult Ebstein patient.  ;Ebstein anomaly comprises approximately 1% of all congenital heart diseases. It occurs when the tricuspid valve fails to properly delaminate from the right ventricle, resulting in a clinical spectrum of abnormal tricuspid valve morphology and right ventricular dysfunction. Due to the anatomy of the tricuspid valve and right ventricle, as well as associated right- and left-sided pathology, patients are at risk for both right and left ventricular failure and the associated symptoms of each. Ebstein patients are also at risk for atrial arrhythmias, due to the atrial enlargement intrinsic to the anatomy, as well as the presence of potential accessory pathways. Arrhythmias are generally poorly tolerated, particularly in the setting of ventricular dysfunction. Cyanosis may also be present in Ebstein patients, due to the common occurrence of atrial communications, which can exacerbate other symptoms of heart failure. Treatment of heart failure can be through pharmacologic and procedural interventions, depending on the underlying cause of heart failure. While early heart failure symptoms may be treated with medical management, most Ebstein patients will require surgery. Various surgical and catheter-based interventions targeting the tricuspid valve and the atrialized right ventricular tissue have been developed to help treat the underlying cause of the heart failure. The optimal timing of transcatheter and surgical intervention in the Ebstein patient to prevent or treat heart failure needs further study.  
Sex differences in patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot support a tailored approach for males and females: a cardiac magnetic resonance study.  ;Purpose Substantial differences between sexes exist with respect to cardiovascular diseases, including congenital heart disease. Nevertheless, clinical decisions in the long-term follow-up of patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot (rTOF) are currently based on unisex thresholds for cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) measurements. This study aimed to assess whether sex differences exist in cardiac adaptation to hemodynamic loading conditions in patients with rTOF. Methods and Results This cross-sectional, two-center, combined pediatric and adult cohort included 320 rTOF patients (163 males, 51%) who underwent routine CMR. Despite similar age (median and interquartile range [m + IQR] 23.4 [15.2-34.4] years), surgical history, and hemodynamic loading, males with rTOF demonstrated higher biventricular CMR-derived volumes and masses, indexed for body surface area, compared to females (e.g. m + IQR right ventricular (RV) end-diastolic volume: males 123 [100-151] mL/m2, females 114 [94-131] mL/m2, P = 0.007). Sex-specific Z-scores of biventricular volumes and masses were similar for males and females. RV volumes and masses correlated with hemodynamic loading, but these relations did not differ between sexes. Biventricular ejection fraction (EF) appeared to be lower in male patients, compared to female patients (e.g. m + IQR RVEF: males 48 [43-54]%, females 52 [46-57]%, P < 0.001). Conclusion Indexed ventricular volumes and masses are higher in males with rTOF, compared to females, similar to the healthy population. RV hypertrophy and dilatation correlated to loading conditions similarly for both sexes. However, under comparable loading conditions, males demonstrated more severe functional impairment. These results indicate that sex-differences should no longer be ignored in treatment strategies, including timing of pulmonary valve replacement.  
Accuracy of cardiac magnetic resonance generated 3D models of the aortic annulus compared to cardiovascular computed tomography generated 3D models.  ;"To evaluate the accuracy of 3D models of the aortic-root generated from non-contrast cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR). Data were retrospectively collected from 30 consecutive patients who underwent surgical aortic valve replacement and had available records of both intra-operative assessment and pre-surgery annulus assessment by cardiovascular computed tomography (CCT) and CMR. The 3D models were independently segmented, modelled and printed by two blinded ""manufacturers"". The measurements on the models were carried out by two cardiac surgeons with Hegar dilator. Data were analyzed with non-parametric tests. There was no significant intra- or inter-observer variability (p ≥ 0.13). The agreement between the diameter of the 3D model derived from CMR images and either the anatomical reference of the intraoperative measurement (p = 0.10, r = 0.97) or the radiological reference of the 3D model generated from CCT (p = 0.71, r = 0.92) was very good. The process of segmentation plus the post-processing was about 17 ± 2 min for a model created by CMR, significantly higher than a model created from CCT (7 ± 2 min; p < 0.001). The printing time for a single model did not differ between the two modalities (p = 0.61) and was less than 60 min. The cost for a single model was approximately 0.5 €. 3D models generated from non-contrast CMR performed well when compared to the anatomical reference standard and are comparable to the pair CCT derived models.

Endocarditis risk with bioprosthetic and mechanical valves: systematic review and meta-analysis.  ;OBJECTIVE: Bioprosthetic valves are being used with increased frequency for valve replacement, with controversy regarding risk:benefit ratio compared with mechanical valves in younger patients. However, prior studies have been too small to provide comparative estimates of less common but serious adverse events such as infective endocarditis. We aimed to compare the incidence of infective endocarditis between bioprosthetic valves and mechanical valves. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Cochrane, EMBASE, Scopus and Web of Science from inception to April 2018 for studies comparing left-sided aortic and mitral bioprosthetic to mechanical valves for randomised trials or observational studies with propensity matching. We used random-effects model for our meta-analysis. Our primary outcome of interest was the rate of infective endocarditis at follow-up. RESULTS: 13 comparison groups with 43 941 patients were included. Mean age was 59±7 years with a mean follow-up of 10.4±5.0 years. Patients with bioprosthetic valves had a higher risk of infective endocarditis compared with patients receiving mechanical valves (OR 1.59, 95% CI 1.35 to 1.88, p<0.001) with an absolute risk reduction of 9 per 1000 (95% CI 6 to 14). Heterogeneity within the included studies was low (I2=0%). Exclusion of the study with maximum weight did not change the results of the analysis (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.14 to 2.17, p=0.006). A meta-regression of follow-up time on incidence of infective endocarditis was not statistically significant (p=0.788) indicating difference in follow-up times did not alter the pooled risk of infective endocarditis. CONCLUSIONS: Bioprosthetic valves may be associated with a higher risk of infective endocarditis. These data should help guide the discussion when deciding between bioprosthetic and mechanical valves in individual patients.  
Implications of Renal Disease in Patients Undergoing Structural Interventions.  ;Chronic kidney disease patients have a high prevalence of severe valvular heart disease, which reduces life expectancy. Transcatheter valve interventions has revamped the way we manage severe valvular heart disease and are an attractive alternative to invasive surgery in patients with chronic kidney disease and severe valvular heart disease. This review summarizes the impact of transcatheter valve interventions in patients with severe valvular heart disease and chronic kidney disease.  
Four-dimensional-flow Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Aortic Valve and Thoracic Aorta.  ;Blood flow through the heart and great vessels is sensitive to time and multiple velocity directions. The assessment of its three-dimensional nature has been limited. Recent advances in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allow the comprehensive visualization and quantification of in vivo flow dynamics using four-dimensional (4D)-flow MRI. In addition, the technique provides the opportunity to obtain advanced hemodynamic measures. This article introduces 4D-flow MRI as it is currently used for blood flow visualization and quantification of cardiac hemodynamic parameters. It discusses its advantages relative to other flow MRI techniques and describes its potential clinical applications.  
Preoperative Planning for Structural Heart Disease.  ;Preoperative assessment with computed tomography (CT) is critical before transcatheter interventions for structural heart disease. CT provides information for device selection, device sizing, and vascular access approach. The interpreting radiologist must have knowledge of appropriate CT protocols, how and where to obtain the important measurements, and know additional imaging characteristics that are important to describe for optimal support of the interventionalist. CT is the modality of choice for pre-operative evaluation in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement and left atrial appendage occlusion, and is also useful before transcatheter mitral valve replacement, which is an ongoing area of research.  
The effects of body mass index on outcomes for patients undergoing surgical aortic valve replacement.  ;"BACKGROUND: Most of the studies of obesity and postoperative outcome have looked predominantly at coronary artery bypass grafting with fewer focused on valvular disease. The purpose of this study was to compare the outcomes of patients undergoing aortic valve replacement stratified by body mass index (BMI, kg/m^2). METHODS: The Alberta Provincial Project for Outcome Assessment in Coronary Heart Disease registry captured 4780 aortic valve replacements in Alberta, Canada from January 2004 to December 2018. All recipients were stratified by BMI into five groups (BMI: < 20, 20-24.9, 25-29.9, 30-34.9, and > = 35). Log-rank test and Cox regression were used to examine the crude and adjusted survival differences. RESULTS: Intra-operative clamp time and pump time were similar among the five groups. Significant statistical differences between groups existed for the incidence of isolated AVR, AVR and CABG, hemorrhage, septic infection, and deep sternal infection (p < 0.05). While there was no significant statistical difference in the mortality rate across the BMI groups, the underweight AVR patients (BMI < 20) were associated with increased hazard ratio (1.519; 95% confidence interval: 1.028-2.245) with regards to all-cause mortality at the longest follow-up compared with normal weight patients. CONCLUSION: Overweight and obese patients should be considered as readily for AVR as normal BMI patients.  "
Combined Coronary CT-Angiography and TAVI-Planning: A Contrast-Neutral Routine Approach for Ruling-out Significant Coronary Artery Disease.  ;"BACKGROUND: Significant coronary artery disease (CAD) is a common finding in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). Assessment of CAD prior to TAVI is recommended by current guidelines and is mainly performed via invasive coronary angiography (ICA). In this study we analyzed the ability of coronary CT-angiography (cCTA) to rule out significant CAD (stenosis ≥ 50%) during routine pre-TAVI evaluation in patients with high pre-test probability for CAD. METHODS: In total, 460 consecutive patients undergoing pre-TAVI CT (mean age 79.6 ± 7.4 years) were included. All patients were examined with a retrospectively ECG-gated CT-scan of the heart, followed by a high-pitch-scan of the vascular access route utilizing a single intravenous bolus of 70 ml iodinated contrast medium. Images were evaluated for image quality, calcifications, and significant CAD; CT-examinations in which CAD could not be ruled out were defined as positive (CAD+). Routinely, patients received ICA (388/460; 84.3%; Group A), which was omitted if renal function was impaired and CAD was ruled out on cCTA (Group B). Following TAVI, clinical events were documented during the hospital stay. RESULTS: cCTA was negative for CAD in 40.2% (188/460). Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV in Group A were 97.8%, 45.2%, 49.6%, and 97.4%, respectively. Median coronary artery calcium score (CAC) was higher in CAD+-patients but did not have predictive value for correct classification of patients with cCTA. There were no significant differences in clinical events between Group A and B. CONCLUSION: cCTA can be incorporated into pre-TAVI CT-evaluation with no need for additional contrast medium. cCTA may exclude significant CAD in a relatively high percentage of these high-risk patients. Thereby, cCTA may have the potential to reduce the need for ICA and total amount of contrast medium applied, possibly making pre-procedural evaluation for TAVI safer and faster.  "
Progression of Lactobacillus plantarum prosthetic valve endocarditis followed by transesophageal echocardiogram.  ;Endocarditis due to Lactobacillus species is extremely rare. We report an uncommon case of Lactobacillus plantarum bioprosthetic aortic valve endocarditis, presenting with severe aortic steno-regurgitation, which responded to conventional medical and surgical treatment. This case provides a better understanding of the disease process of L. plantarum and highlights the role of transesophageal echocardiography in following the entire course of endocarditis.  
Incidence, predictors and outcomes of valve-in-valve TAVI: A systematic review and meta-analysis.  ;"AIMS: Surgical aortic valve replacement has been the treatment of choice for patients with aortic valve disease before the arrival of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVI), although limited by degeneration of the bioprosthesis. ""Redo"" intervention itself is burdened by high risk of complications and valve-in-valve (ViV) TAVI could be a valid strategy of redo for patients with comorbidities. METHODS AND RESULTS: Two independent reviewers screened all studies investigating patients undergoing ViV TAVI. Mortality at 30 days and at 1 year was the primary end point. Of 286 studies identified, 26 articles were included in this review with a total of 1448 patients. Median age was 78.8 years, 57.7% male. Median STS score and Logistic EuroSCORE were 9.4% and 31.3% respectively. Stenosis (45%) was the leading cause of prosthesis failure. Transfemoral approach was preferred (76%), with a prevalence of balloon expandable valves (73.3%). Mean follow up was 376 days. Overall and cardiovascular mortality at 30 days was 6.5% and 5.5% respectively, while at 1 year it was 14.5% and 8.9% respectively. At meta-regression analysis study year (p < .001), Logistic EuroSCORE (p < .01) and valve diameter ≤ 21 mm (p < .05) at 30 days, and stenosis as reason for failure (p = .05) at 1 year were identified as possible predictors of survival. CONCLUSIONS: ViV TAVI offers a valid strategy to treat high risk patients with a failure of bioprosthesis with satisfying results in terms of short and mid-term mortality. Future studies are needed to find predictors of long term survival and outcomes in lower risk patients.  "
Challenges and experience of setting up an aortic service.  ;Aortic surgery is a complex procedure posing high risks in comparison to other adult cardiac surgeries. Novel surgical approaches including minimally invasive procedures, sutureless aortic valve replacement, and transcatheter aortic valve implantation have been found to be acceptable alternatives to conventional surgeries. In addition, novel endovascular repair techniques and hybrid procedures have been introduced for the management of patients with thoracoabdominal aortic pathologies. However, these modalities are not readily available in every center, and such novel procedures impose a learning curve for surgeons and high costs for affected patients. In this review, we discuss the challenges of setting up an aortic service, having regard to the Iranian experience.  
Perspectives on surgical treatment of mitral valve disease.  ;A sound knowledge of the functional anatomy of the mitral valve and the alterations caused by different diseases is indispensable for surgeons treating patients with mitral valve disease. Rheumatic mitral valve disease remains the most common heart valvular disorder in developing countries, whereas mitral regurgitation due myxomatous degeneration of the valve is the most common in developed countries. The mitral valve should be repaired whenever possible, as long as the outcome is predictably better than that of replacement. The intraoperative decision to repair or replace is not always simple and depends on the experience of the surgeon and the pathological changes that caused mitral valve dysfunction.  
Spectrum of Cardiac Manifestations in COVID-19: A Systematic Echocardiographic Study.  ;BACKGROUND: Information on the cardiac manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is scarce. We performed a systematic and comprehensive echocardiographic evaluation of consecutive patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infection. METHODS: One hundred consecutive patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection underwent complete echocardiographic evaluation within 24 hours of admission and were compared with reference values. Echocardiographic studies included left ventricular (LV) systolic and diastolic function and valve hemodynamics and right ventricular (RV) assessment, as well as lung ultrasound. A second examination was performed in case of clinical deterioration. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients (32%) had a normal echocardiogram at baseline. The most common cardiac pathology was RV dilatation and dysfunction (observed in 39% of patients), followed by LV diastolic dysfunction (16%) and LV systolic dysfunction (10%). Patients with elevated troponin (20%) or worse clinical condition did not demonstrate any significant difference in LV systolic function compared with patients with normal troponin or better clinical condition, but they had worse RV function. Clinical deterioration occurred in 20% of patients. In these patients, the most common echocardiographic abnormality at follow-up was RV function deterioration (12 patients), followed by LV systolic and diastolic deterioration (in 5 patients). Femoral deep vein thrombosis was diagnosed in 5 of 12 patients with RV failure. CONCLUSIONS: In COVID-19 infection, LV systolic function is preserved in the majority of patients, but LV diastolic function and RV function are impaired. Elevated troponin and poorer clinical grade are associated with worse RV function. In patients presenting with clinical deterioration at follow-up, acute RV dysfunction, with or without deep vein thrombosis, is more common, but acute LV systolic dysfunction was noted in ≈20%.  
Subclinical Left Ventricular Dysfunction In Patients With Isolated Severe Rheumatic Mitral Stenosis Having Normal Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction.  ;BACKGROUND: Mitral stenosis (MS) is a prevalent disease in the developing world. It is a preventable disease associated with considerably high morbidity and mortality rates. Myocarditis secondary to rheumatic MS can cause left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. In majority of the case this LV dysfunction is subclinical. Recent development in imaging techniques like tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) and strain imaging enabled us to detect subclinical LV dysfunction. One such example is Global Longitudinal Strain (GLS), which is a reliable mean of assessing LV dysfunction in patients diagnosed with mitral stenosis. This study is design to determine the frequency of subclinical LV dysfunction in patients presenting with severe MS of rheumatic etiology in our institute. Objective of the study was to determine frequency of subclinical LV dysfunction by mean GLS in patients with isolated severe Rheumatic MS having normal LV Ejection fraction measured by 2D/M-mode echocardiography. It was an observational crosssectional study, conducted at Department of Cardiology, Rawalpindi Institute of Cardiology, Rawalpindi, during the period of six months from 1st January to 30th June 2016. METHODS: Fiftyfive patients with isolated severe mitral stenosis of underlying rheumatic aetiology with preserve LV function (EF>50%) were selected as per other inclusion and exclusion criteria. All patients were evaluated with detailed history, physical examination and echocardiographic examination. GLS was also noted and all other information was recorded on data collection form. RESULTS: The average age and mean GLS was 48.20±11.62 years and -19.24±1.15% respectively. Left ventricular systolic impairment in patients under study using the Global Longitudinal Strain was seen in 16.36% (9/55) cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that GLS helps in detecting impairment of LV systolic function at an early stage in patients with mitral stenosis which helps in their risk stratification thus warranting their early management.

Infective Endocarditis Caused by Rhodococcus equi in an Immunocompetent Patient.  ;Rhodococcus equi (R. equi) is a rare zoonotic organism that is found in the feces of grazing animals and in farm soil. It typically causes pulmonary disease, but it can also cause extrapulmonary disease. Immunocompromised patients are at a higher risk of developing the infection, but it has been reported in individuals with competent immune system as well. We present a unique case of infectious endocarditis (IE) due to a R. equi infection in an immunocompetent patient. A 77-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, prior myocardial infarction, systolic heart failure, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, aortic stenosis, and benign prostatic hypertrophy was evaluated by cardiothoracic surgery for coronary and valvular heart disease. His transesophageal echocardiogram and cardiac catheterization demonstrated severe aortic stenosis and multivessel coronary artery disease. The patient underwent coronary artery bypass grafting and simultaneous aortic valve replacement. Intraoperatively, there was exudative material covering his aortic valve, which was sent for tissue culture. Tissue culture was positive for R. equi and Enterococcus faecium.  R. equi endocarditis is a rare presentation of this organism. R. equi endocarditis is a very challenging diagnosis due to its varying presentation compared to typical IE. Detailed history taking and physical exam are extremely important to determine if further evaluation is needed. Prolonged oral and intravenous antibiotics are recommended for effective treatment.

Poorly suited heart valve prostheses heighten the plight of patients with rheumatic heart disease.  ;Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) still affects more patients globally than degenerative valve disease. The vast majority of these patients live in low- to middle-income countries. Once symptomatic, they will need heart valve surgery. Unfortunately, prosthetic valves perform poorly in these patients given their young age, the high incidence of multi-valve disease, late diagnoses and often challenging socio-economic circumstances. Notwithstanding the fact that better valve designs would ideally be available, ill-informed decision making processes between bioprosthetic and mechanical valves are contributing to the poor results. In the absence of multicentred, randomised clinical trials, comparing the current generations of bioprostheses with mechanical valves across all age groups Western guidelines tend to be uncritically applied. As a consequence, mechanical valves are being implanted into patients who are often not able to deal with anticoagulation while bioprosthetic valves may be overly shunned for fear of reoperations. Almost sixty years after the advent of cardiac surgery heart valve prostheses have eventually undergone improvements and several potentially disruptive developments are on the horizon. Until they materialise, however, choices between contemporary valve prostheses need to be made on the basis of individual risk and life-expectancy rather than an uncritical implementation of guidelines that were derived for very different patients and under distinctly different conditions. Given the fast expansion of cardiac surgery in middle-income countries and a growing number of independently operating centres in low-income countries a critical appraisal of facts underlying the choice of heart valve prostheses for patients with RHD seems opportune.  
Severe Mitral Annular Calcification and Mitral Valve Surgery: An Algorithmic Approach to Management.  ;The management of mitral valve dysfunction in the setting of substantial mitral annular calcification (MAC) remains controversial and is one of the most challenging problems in mitral valve surgery. The physiopathology of severe MAC is related to a combination of progressive, degenerative and active calcium deposition in the annulus that is often multifactorial, but largely attributable to aging and chronic disease conditions. Given the fact that overall life expectancy in the elderly population are increasing, it is imperative to understand contemporary and future therapeutic options since this MAC is likely going to be a frequent problem faced by the next generation of cardiac surgeons. This review provides a relevant synthesis of existing literature and aims to assess the efficacy of existing therapeutic choices for patients with mitral valve dysfunction and 'big' MAC with a goal of minimizing postoperative complications (e.g. left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, prosthetic paravalvular leak, valve embolization, and stroke) that can be achieved via a multidisciplinary heart team approach.  
Predictors of functional improvement in the short term after MitraClip implantation in patients with secondary mitral regurgitation.  ;BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: MitraClip implantation is an established therapy for secondary mitral regurgitation (MR) in high-risk patients and has shown to improve several important outcome parameters such as functional capacity. Patient selection is both challenging and crucial for achieving therapeutic success. This study investigated baseline predictors of functional improvement as it was quantified by the six-minute walk distance (6MWD) after transcatheter mitral valve repair. METHODS AND RESULTS: We retrospectively analyzed 79 patients with secondary MR treated with MitraClip implantation at an academic tertiary care center. Before and four weeks after the procedure, all patients underwent comprehensive clinical assessment, six-minute walk tests and echocardiography. 6MWD significantly improved after MitraClip therapy (295 m vs. 265 m, p < 0.001). A linear regression model including seven clinical baseline variables significantly predicted the change in 6MWD (p = 0.002, R2 = 0.387). Female gender, diabetes mellitus and arterial hypertension were found to be significant negative predictors of 6MWD improvement. At baseline, female patients had significant higher left ventricular ejection fraction (49% vs. 42%, p = 0.019) and lower 6MWD (240 m vs. 288 m, p = 0.034) than male patients. CONCLUSION: MitraClip implantation in secondary MR significantly improves functional capacity in high-risk patients even in the short term of four weeks after the procedure. Female gender, diabetes mellitus and arterial hypertension are baseline predictors of a less favourable functional outcome. While further validation in a larger cohort is recommended, these parameters may improve patient selection for MitraClip therapy.

Possible new options and benefits to detect myocarditis, right ventricular remodeling and coronary anomalies by echocardiography in systematic preparticipation screening of athletes.  ;Exclusion of cardiac abnormalities should be performed at the beginning of the athlete's career. Myocarditis, right ventricular remodeling and coronary anomalies are well-known causes of life-threatening events of athletes, major cardiovascular events and sudden cardiac death. The feasibility of an extended comprehensive echocardiographic protocol for the detection of structural cardiac abnormalities in athletes should be tested. This standardized protocol of transthoracic echocardiography includes two- and three-dimensional imaging, tissue Doppler imaging, and coronary artery scanning. Post processing was performed for deformation analysis of all compounds including layer strain. During 2017 and 2018, the feasibility of successful image acquisition and post processing analysis was retrospectively analyzed in 54 male elite athletes. In addition, noticeable findings inside the analyzed cohort are described. The extended image acquisition and data analyzing was feasible from 74 to 100%, depending on the used modalities. One case of myocarditis was detected in the present cohort. Coronary anomalies were not found. Right ventricular size and function were within normal ranges. Isovolumetric right ventricular relaxation time showed significant regional differences. One case of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and two subjects with bicuspid aortic valves were found. Due to the excessive cardiac stress in highly competitive sports, high-quality and precise screening modalities are necessary, especially with respect to acquired cardiac diseases like acute myocarditis and pathological changes of left ventricular and RV geometry. The documented feasibility of the proposed extended protocol underlines the suitability to detect distinct morphological and functional cardiac alterations and documents the potential added value of a comprehensive echocardiography.  
Impact of right atrium dimension on adverse outcome after pulmonary valve replacement in repaired Tetralogy of Fallot patients.  ;The hemodynamic impact of residual pulmonary regurgitation (PR) in repaired Tetralogy of Fallot (rTOF) has been well demonstrated. However, markers driving the decision making process to indicate the ideal timing of pulmonary valve replacement (PVR) are still uncertain. Furthermore, very few studies have included the right atrium (RA) dilatation as a preoperative risk factor for post-PVR clinical adverse outcome. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of pre-PVR right atrial dilation on adverse outcomes in rTOF. We retrospectively reviewed from our CMR database all rTOF patients who underwent CMR study before and after PVR. Detailed clinical and surgical history were collected, in addition to imaging data. The composite primary and secondary post-PVR end points were also recorded. The study cohort consisted of 41 patients (mean age at PVR repair 27.4 ± 10 years). As expected, end-diastolic and end-systolic right ventricle (RV) volumes significantly decreased after PVR (p < 0.001). The RV reverse remodeling, defined by ΔRVEDVi and ΔRVESVi, was associated with both pre-PVR RVEDVi and RVESVi. The higher the pre-PVR RV volumes, more the RV reverse remodeling will be obtained post-surgery. Patients who experienced an adverse outcome were older at pre-PVR, they had a higher Nt-ProBNP, worse VO2/kg/min, more significant tricuspid regurgitation and more dilated RA. The association with the RA dilatation persists and becomes even more significant if we exclude patients who had tricuspid repair beside RVOT surgical reconstruction. Besides RV volumes and function, RA dimensions may play a pivotal role in the decision making of TOF patients.  
Redo MitraClip for Late Recurrent Severe Mitral Regurgitation: Case Report and Literature Review.  ;Transcatheter mitral valve repair using the MitraClip (Abbott Vascular, Santa Clara, CA) is a reasonable option for the treatment of patients with severe symptomatic degenerative mitral regurgitation (MR) who are at prohibitive surgical risk. The occurrence of recurrent severe MR after initial successful MitraClip repair is uncommon. Data are sparse on the management of recurrent severe MR after initial successful repair using the MitraClip. We describe a successful case of redo MitraClip repair for late recurrent severe MR secondary to progressive degenerative mitral valve disease after a successful initial MitraClip procedure and review the literature.  
Beta-Hemolytic Streptococcal Infective Endocarditis: Characteristics and Outcomes From a Large, Multinational Cohort.  ;"BACKGROUND: Beta-hemolytic streptococci (BHS) are an uncommon cause of infective endocarditis (IE). The aim of this study was to describe the clinical features and outcomes of patients with BHS IE in a large multinational cohort and compare them with patients with viridans streptococcal IE. METHODS: The International Collaboration on Endocarditis Prospective Cohort Study (ICE-PCS) is a large multinational database that recruited patients with IE prospectively using a standardized data set. Sixty-four sites in 28 countries reported patients prospectively using a standard case report form developed by ICE collaborators. RESULTS: Among 1336 definite cases of streptococcal IE, 823 were caused by VGS and 147 by BHS. Patients with BHS IE had a lower prevalence of native valve (P < .005) and congenital heart disease predisposition (P = .002), but higher prevalence of implantable cardiac device predisposition (P < .005). Clinically, they were more likely to present acutely (P < .005) and with fever (P = .024). BHS IE was more likely to be complicated by stroke and other systemic emboli (P < .005). The overall in-hospital mortality of BHS IE was significantly higher than that of VGS IE (P = .001). In univariate analysis, variables associated with in-hospital mortality for BHS IE were age (odds ratio [OR], 1.044; P = .004), prosthetic valve IE (OR, 3.029; P = .022), congestive heart failure (OR, 2.513; P = .034), and stroke (OR, 3.198; P = .009). CONCLUSIONS: BHS IE is characterized by an acute presentation and higher rate of stroke, systemic emboli, and in-hospital mortality than VGS IE. Implantable cardiac devices as a predisposing factor were more often found in BHS IE compared with VGS IE.  "
Hospital-Acquired Functional Decline and Clinical Outcomes in Older Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.  ;BACKGROUND: This study aimed to assess the relationship between hospital-acquired functional decline and the risk of mid-term all-cause death in older patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI).Methods and Results:In total, 463 patients (mean age 85 years, interquartile range [IQR]: 82, 88) undergoing elective TAVI at Sakakibara Heart Institute between 2010 and 2018, who were followed up for 3 years, were enrolled in the study. Hospital-acquired functional decline after TAVI, which was defined by at least a 1-point decrease on the Short Physical Performance Battery before discharge compared to the preoperative score, was assessed. A total of 113 patients (24.4%) showed hospital-acquired functional decline after TAVI, and 50 (11.3%) patients died over a mean follow-up period of 1.9±0.8 years. Kaplan-Meier survival curves indicated that hospital-acquired functional decline was significantly associated with all-cause mortality (log-rank test, P=0.001). On multivariate Cox regression analysis, hospital-acquired functional decline was associated with a higher risk of all-cause mortality (OR 2.108, 95% CI 1.119-3.968, P=0.021) independent of sex, body mass index, advanced chronic kidney disease, and preoperative frailty, as assessed by the modified essential frail toolkit. CONCLUSIONS: Hospital-acquired functional decline is associated with mid-term all-cause mortality in older patients following TAVI. Trajectory of functional status is a vital sign, and it is useful for risk stratification in older patients following TAVI.  
The value of extensive catheter linear ablation on persistent atrial fibrillation (the CLEAR-AF Study).  ;BACKGROUND: The ablation therapy for persistent atrial fibrillation (PerAF) is still a challenge due to the high recurrence rate. This study was aimed to investigate the value of extensive linear ablation with contact force sensing techniques for PerAF. METHODS: A total of 214 patients with PerAF were enrolled in five centers. The patients were randomly assigned to Group I (PVI + LA roof line+ LA anterior wall line) and Group II (PVI + LA roof line), mitral valve isthmus lines were added in both groups if the atrial fibrillation (AF) could not be terminated after all approaches above. RESULTS: Acute success rate of AF termination during the ablation procedure in Group I was significantly higher than Group II (P = 0.028). Two-years follow-up showed no significant difference in the sinus rhythm maintenance rate between the two groups (63.4% in group I vs. 57.2% in group II, P = 0.218). More patients in Group I recurred as organized atrial tachycardia (AT) and can be precisely mapped during repeat ablation procedures (15 vs. 2, P = 0.001). The Kaplan-Meier estimates of AF/AT-free survival after repeat ablation procedures were 76.2% in Group I and 47.1% in Group II (P = 0.039). CONCLUSIONS: Extensive linear ablation with contact force monitoring did not improve the long-term outcomes for PerAF patients. Repeat ablation procedure showed a possible higher chance of sinus rhythm restoration during follow-up.  
Durability of bioprosthetic aortic valves in patients under the age of 60 years - rationale and design of the international INDURE registry.  ;BACKGROUND: There is an ever-growing number of patients requiring aortic valve replacement (AVR). Limited data is available on the long-term outcomes and structural integrity of bioprosthetic valves in younger patients undergoing surgical AVR. METHODS: The INSPIRIS RESILIA Durability Registry (INDURE) is a prospective, open-label, multicentre, international registry with a follow-up of 5 years to assess clinical outcomes of patients younger than 60 years who undergo surgical AVR using the INSPIRIS RESILIA aortic valve. INDURE will be conducted across 20-22 sites in Europe and Canada and intends to enrol minimum of 400 patients. Patients will be included if they are scheduled to undergo AVR with or without concomitant root replacement and/or coronary bypass surgery. The primary objectives are to 1) determine VARC-2 defined time-related valve safety at one-year (depicted as freedom from events) and 2) determine freedom from stage 3 structural valve degeneration (SVD) presenting as morphological abnormalities and severe haemodynamic valve degeneration at 5 years. Secondary objectives include the assessment of the haemodynamic performance of the valve, all stages of SVD, potential valve-in-valve procedures, clinical outcomes (in terms of New York Heart Association [NYHA] function class and freedom from valve-related rehospitalisation) and change in patient quality-of-life. DISCUSSION: INDURE is a prospective, multicentre registry in Europe and Canada, which will provide much needed data on the long-term performance of bioprosthetic valves in general and the INSPIRIS RESILIA valve in particular. The data may help to gather a deeper understanding of the longevity of bioprosthetic valves and may expand the use of bioprosthetic valves in patients under the age of 60 years.

Successful use of Protek Duo cannula to provide veno-venous extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation and right ventricular support for acute respiratory distress syndrome in an adolescent with complex congenital heart disease.  ;Rescuing patients with the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome and right heart failure after left ventricular assist device placement remains a challenge in patients with congenital heart disease. TandemLife Protek Duo (TandemLife, Pittsburg, PA) is a double-lumen cannula introduced via the internal jugular vein that can provide veno-venous extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation and right heart support. To our knowledge, we report the first case of successfully using the TandemLife Protek Duo cannula to provide veno-venous extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation and right ventricle support in an adolescent male with an existing right ventricle-pulmonary artery conduit and the melody pulmonary valve who developed severe acute respiratory distress syndrome after the placement of left ventricular assist device. The stability of the cannula enabled minimal recirculation-related hypoxia events, early mobilization, and ambulation. Our patient was discharged home after lung recovery and currently awaiting a heart transplant.

Transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement in pediatric patients.  ;INTRODUCTION: Right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) dysfunction is common among individuals with congenital heart disease (CHD). Surgical intervention often carries prohibitive risks due to the need for sequential pulmonary valve (PV) replacements throughout their life in the majority of cases. Transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement (tPVR) is one of the most exciting recent developments in the treatment of CHD and has evolved to become an attractive alternative to surgery in patients with RVOT dysfunction. AREAS COVERED: In this review, we examine the pathophysiology of RVOT dysfunction, indications for tPVR, and the procedural aspect. Advancements in clinical application and valve technology will also be covered. EXPERT OPINION: tPVR is widely accepted as an alternative to surgery to address RVOT dysfunction, but still significant numbers of patients with complex RVOT morphology deemed not suitable for tPVR. As the technology continues to evolve, new percutaneous valves will allow such complex RVOT patient to benefit from tPVR.  
The Clinical Challenge of Clonal Hematopoiesis, a Newly Recognized Cardiovascular Risk Factor.  ;IMPORTANCE: Despite current standards of cardiovascular care, a considerable residual burden of risk remains in both primary and secondary prevention. Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) has recently emerged as a common, potent, age-associated, independent risk factor for myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure events, and survival following percutaneous aortic valve intervention. The presence of CHIP results from the acquisition of somatic mutations in a small number of leukemia driver genes found in bone marrow stem cells, leading to the expansion of leukocytes clones in peripheral blood. The association between CHIP and cardiovascular disease likely involves activation of the inflammasome pathway. More common DNA sequencing identifies individuals with CHIP who then seek advice regarding management of their cardiovascular risk. OBSERVATIONS: Using clinical vignettes based on real encounters, we highlight some of the diverse presentations of CHIP, ranging from incidental identification to that detected during cancer care, that have brought patients to the attention of cardiovascular practitioners. We illustrate how we have applied a consensus-based approach to the evaluation and management of cardiovascular risk in specific patients with CHIP. Since we currently lack evidence to guide the management of these individuals, we must rely on expert opinion while awaiting data to furnish a firmer foundation for our recommendations. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These vignettes illustrate that the management of CHIP should involve an individualized plan based on features such as comorbidities, life expectancy, and other traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Because individuals with CHIP will increasingly seek advice from cardiovascular specialists regarding management, these examples provide a template for approaches based on a multidisciplinary perspective. The current need for reliance on expert opinion illustrates a great need for further investigation into the management of this newly recognized contributor to residual cardiovascular risk, both in patients who are apparently well and those with established cardiovascular or malignant disease.  
Surgery from the future: Performing a safe valve-in-valve explantation.  ;As the number of young and relatively low-risk patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation increases, the number who will require open heart surgery months or years later will also increase. Only a few cases of late transcatheter heart valve explantation (without root replacement) have been reported in the literature, and this rare procedure can be surgically very challenging. In this video tutorial we present the case of a patient with a valve-in-valve subacute thrombosis, and we describe the surgical technique for valve explantation.  
Aortic valve construction using new nitinol templates and pericardial tissue.  ;The use of pericardial tissue has been widely adopted in a range of cardiac surgery procedures involving the reconstruction of heart valves. Its use in aortic valve construction has been discussed in recent years by Ozaki et al. A key parameter in the optimal functioning of a fabricated valve is the sizing of the new cusps. This video tutorial demonstrates aortic valve construction using newly designed templates and forceps to facilitate sizing and enhance the symmetrical coaptation of the new cusps.  
Simultaneous Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation and Infrarenal Aortic Aneurysm Repair for Severe Aortic Stenosis and Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm: Report of 2 Cases and Literature Review.  ;The prevalence of concomitant abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and severe aortic stenosis (AS) has been increasing in the elderly population. Both conditions have adverse outcomes, if not adequately managed. No clear recommendations are available in the literature until today, in regards of the management sequence making thus the decision-making challenging. We report 2 cases of AAA and significant AS treated with endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) and transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) during the same procedure and a review of the literature on this topic. Based on our experience, the combined procedure with TAVI followed by EVAR seems to be feasible, safe, and effective while detailed preoperative planning and a carefully tailored management strategy by a multidisciplinary team are essential.

Exercise behavior of degenerative mitral stenosis.  ;Mitral annular calcification (MAC) is increasingly encountered, particularly among the elderly and those with chronic kidney disease, and is often associated with a transvalvular gradient. In contrast to rheumatic mitral stenosis relatively little is known about mitral stenosis due to MAC. We aimed to clarify whether exercise limitation in this group is primarily due to valvular obstruction or ventricular dysfunction resulting from multiple comorbidities. 20 patients with severe MAC (bulky calcium deposits which restricted leaflet motion) were submitted to supine bicycle exercise, measuring Doppler and echocardiographic parameters at baseline and during exercise. They were compared 1:1 to subjects matched for age, sex, and left ventricular wall thickness. At baseline MAC subjects had higher mean mitral valve gradients (MVG) than comparison subjects (7.5 ± 3.8 vs 1.6 ± 0.8 mm Hg, p < 0.0001), along with larger indexed left atrial volumes (54.4 ± 14.9 vs 34.0 ± 11.7 mL, p < 0.0001) and reduced left atrial strains (reservoir, conduit, and booster pump). With exercise MAC subjects reached higher levels of MVG (17.3 ± 8.4 vs 5.5 ± 2.5 mm Hg, p < 0.0001), and pulmonary artery systolic pressure (estimated from tricuspid regurgitant jet [TR] velocity) and displayed a moderate correlation between ΔMVG and ΔTR velocity (r2 = 0.57). MAC subjects whose exercise MVG was ≥ 15 mm Hg all had a peak pulmonary artery systolic pressure > 60 mm Hg. MAC subjects also had relative chronotropic incompetence. Patients with severe MAC and a transvalvular gradient experience large increases in MVG and pulmonary pressure with exercise, similar to what has been described in rheumatic mitral stenosis. MAC may be an under-recognized cause of dyspnea and exercise intolerance in older patients.

Alzheimer's Disease and Cardiovascular Disease: A Particular Association.  ;"METHODS: This review is based on the material obtained via MEDLINE (PubMed), EMBASE, and Clinical Trials databases, from January 1980 until May 2019. The search term used was ""Alzheimer's disease,"" combined with ""cardiovascular disease,"" ""hypertension,"" ""dyslipidaemia,"" ""diabetes mellitus,"" ""atrial fibrillation,"" ""coronary artery disease,"" ""heart valve disease,"" and ""heart failure."" Out of the 1,328 papers initially retrieved, 431 duplicates and 216 records in languages other than English were removed. Among the 681 remaining studies, 98 were included in our research material on the basis of the following inclusion criteria: (a) the community-based studies; (b) using standardized diagnostic criteria; (c) reporting raw prevalence data; (d) with separate reported data for sex and age classes. RESULTS: While AD and CVD alone may be considered deleterious to health, the study of their combination constitutes a clinical challenge. Further research will help to clarify the real impact of vascular factors on these diseases. It may be hypothesized that there are various mechanisms underlying the association between AD and CVD, the main ones being hypoperfusion and emboli, atherosclerosis, and the fact that, in both the heart and brain of AD patients, amyloid deposits may be present, thus causing damage to these organs. CONCLUSIONS: AD and CVD are frequently associated. Further studies are needed in order to understand the effect of CVD and its risk factors on AD in order to better comprehend the effects of subclinical and clinical CVD on the brain. Finally, we need to clarify the impact of the underlying hypothesized mechanisms of this association and to investigate gender issues.  "

Pulmonary valve replacement via left thoracotomy as an alternative to resternotomy.  ;Most patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) survive to adulthood and suffer from residual right ventricular pathology, mostly pulmonary regurgitation. Pulmonary valve replacement (PVR) is a procedure of choice to alleviate right ventricular dilatation and pulmonary regurgitation. Resternotomy is the standard approach for PVR in patients who have undergone TOF repair. However, these patients require multiple reoperations during their lifetime. We performed minimally invasive redo PVR through left mini-thoratocomy in two patients who had previously undergone TOF repair through sternotomy.  
Novel frameshift variant in MYL2 reveals molecular differences between dominant and recessive forms of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  ;"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is characterized by thickening of the ventricular muscle without dilation and is often associated with dominant pathogenic variants in cardiac sarcomeric protein genes. Here, we report a family with two infants diagnosed with infantile-onset HCM and mitral valve dysplasia that led to death before one year of age. Using exome sequencing, we discovered that one of the affected children had a homozygous frameshift variant in Myosin light chain 2 (MYL2:NM_000432.3:c.431_432delCT: p.Pro144Argfs*57;MYL2-fs), which alters the last 20 amino acids of the protein and is predicted to impact the most C-terminal of the three EF-hand domains in MYL2. The parents are unaffected heterozygous carriers of the variant and the variant is absent in control cohorts from gnomAD. The absence of the phenotype in carriers and the infantile presentation of severe HCM is in contrast to HCM associated with dominant MYL2 variants. Immunohistochemical analysis of the ventricular muscle of the deceased patient with the MYL2-fs variant showed a marked reduction of MYL2 expression compared to an unaffected control. In vitro overexpression studies further indicate that the MYL2-fs variant is actively degraded. In contrast, an HCM-associated missense variant (MYL2:p.Gly162Arg) and three other MYL2 stop-gain variants (p.E22*, p.K62*, p.E97*) that result in loss of the EF domains are stably expressed but show impaired localization. The degradation of the MYL2-fs can be rescued by inhibiting the cell's proteasome function supporting a post-translational effect of the variant. In vivo rescue experiments with a Drosophila MYL2-homolog (Mlc2) knockdown model indicate that neither the MYL2-fs nor the MYL2:p.Gly162Arg variant supports normal cardiac function. The tools that we have generated provide a rapid screening platform for functional assessment of variants of unknown significance in MYL2. Our study supports an autosomal recessive model of inheritance for MYL2 loss-of-function variants in infantile HCM and highlights the variant-specific molecular differences found in MYL2-associated cardiomyopathy.

Agreement between three-dimensional planimetry and mitral navigation method in the assessment of mitral valve area in rheumatic severe mitral stenosis.  ;Introduction: Rheumatic heart disease predisposes to structural changes in the mitral valve including commissural fusion and calcification with subsequent narrowing of the mitral valve orifice resulting in rheumatic mitral stenosis (RMS). To define the best therapeutic strategy, an accurate measurement of mitral valve area (MVA) for RMS is of paramount importance. The propose of the present study was to assess the agreement between the mitral navigation method (MVN) and three-dimensional (3D) planimetry in the assessment of MVA in patients with RMS.Methods: Patients who were diagnosed with a different degree of mitral stenosis with the standard transthoracic echocardiography methods such as the pressure half time and planimetry underwent 3D transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) examination. 3D TEE zoom mitral valve planimetry was measured in the diastolic frame during the mitral valve's largest opening. By using MVN software of the Philips Q-Lab, MVA was measured at its maximum diastolic opening. Both 3D planimetry (3DPL) and MVN were measured at the mid diastole during the mitral valve's largest opening.Results: In this retrospective analysis, we examined consecutive 37 RMS patients (mean age 51.1 ± 11.6 years, 31 patients were female). MVA measured by the MVN method was found to be highly correlated with the 3D MVA measured by 3DPL (r = 0.937, p<.001).Conclusions: Based on our results, we showed that the MVN method may be additionally used in detecting the severity of RMS.

Left ventricular global longitudinal strain in bicupsid aortic valve patients: head-to-head comparison between computed tomography, 4D flow cardiovascular magnetic resonance and speckle-tracking echocardiography.  ;"Left ventricular global longitudinal strain (LVGLS) analysis is a sensitive measurement of myocardial deformation most often done using speckle-tracking transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). We propose a novel approach to measure LVGLS using feature-tracking software on the magnitude dataset of 4D flow cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) and compare it to dynamic computed tomography (CT) and speckle tracking TTE derived measurements. In this prospective cohort study 59 consecutive adult patients with a bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) were included. The study protocol consisted of TTE, CT, and CMR on the same day. Image analysis was done using dedicated feature-tracking (4D flow CMR and CT) and speckle-tracking (TTE) software, on apical 2-, 3-, and 4-chamber long-axis multiplanar reconstructions (4D flow CMR and CT) or standard apical 2-, 3-, and 4-chamber acquisitions (TTE). CMR and CT GLS analysis was feasible in all patients. Good correlations were observed for GLS measured by CMR (- 21 ± 3%) and CT (- 20 ± 3%) versus TTE (- 20 ± 3%, Pearson's r: 0.67 and 0.65, p < 0.001). CMR also correlated well with CT (Pearson's r 0.62, p < 0.001). The inter-observer analysis showed moderate to good reproducibility of GLS measurement by CMR, CT and TTE (Pearsons's r: 0.51, 0.77, 0.70 respectively; p < 0.05). Additionally, ejection fraction (EF), end-diastolic and end-systolic volume measurements (EDV and ESV) correlated well between all modalities (Pearson's r > 0.61, p < 0.001). Feature-tracking GLS analysis is feasible using the magnitude images acquired with 4D flow CMR. GLS measurement by CMR correlates well with CT and speckle-tracking 2D TTE. GLS analysis on 4D flow CMR allows for an integrative approach, integrating flow and functional data in a single sequence. Not applicable, observational study.  "
"Degenerative Severe Aortic Stenosis and Concomitant Coronary Artery Disease: What Is Changing in the Era of the ""Transcatheter Revolution""?  ";PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To summarize epidemiology, pathophysiology, prognostic relevance, and treatment options of coronary artery disease (CAD) when coupled with severe aortic stenosis (SAS). In regard to treatment options, we focused on the most recently adopted therapeutic approaches and on the future perspectives in light of the latest percutaneous and surgical technical improvements in the field of both CAD and SAS management. RECENT FINDINGS: Nowadays, SAS is the most common valve disease requiring intervention, either surgical or percutaneous. On the other side, CAD is one of the leading causes of death in the developed countries. CAD and degenerative SAS share several predisposing factors and are often concurrently found in clinical practice. Despite in the last years the transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has been deeply changing the therapeutic approach to SAS, the correct management of patients with concomitant CAD remains controversial due to limited and heterogeneous data in the literature. Coronary revascularization is often performed in patients with concomitant CAD and SAS. Complete surgical approach is still the standard of care according to international guidelines. However, in light of the recent results of TAVR trials, the therapeutic approach is expected to change. To date, percutaneous coronary intervention performed before TAVR is safe and feasible even if the optimal timing for revascularization remains debated. Due to the great complexity of the patients affected by SAS and CAD and until unquestionable truths will come from large randomized trials, the role of the Heart Team in the decision-making process is of primary importance to guarantee the best tailored therapeutic strategy for the single patient.

Cardiac magnetic resonance assessment of left ventricular dilatation in chronic severe left-sided regurgitations: comparison with standard echocardiography.  ;"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential additional value of cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) in the assessment of left ventricular (LV) dilatation and dysfunction by comparison to standard echocardiography in patients with chronic left-sided valvular regurgitation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We prospectively enrolled patients with chronic severe mitral regurgitation (MR) or aortic regurgitation (AR). They underwent standard echocardiography and CMR using aortic flow and LV-function sequences. LV dilatation or dysfunction was assessed with each technique, based on thresholds used for surgery indication. Reference regurgitation severity was defined following previously reported CMR-based regurgitant volume thresholds. RESULTS: A total of 71 patients with chronic severe MR (n=44) or severe AR (n=27) were prospectively included. There were 60 men and 11 women with a mean age of 61±14 (SD) years (range: 18-83 years). CMR-based regurgitation severity was significantly greater in the LV dysfunction group when assessed with CMR (MR, P=0.011; AR, P=0.006) whereas it was not different when LV dysfunction was assessed using standard echocardiography. Among standard echocardiography and CMR volumetric indices, CMR-derived end-diastolic volume showed the best ability to predict regurgitation severity (area under the curve [AUC]=0.78 for MR; AUC=0.91 for AR). Diagnostic thresholds identified on receiver operating characteristics-curve analysis were lower than those of current European recommendations and closer to North-American guidelines. CONCLUSION: CMR assessment of LV end-diastolic volume in chronic severe left-sided regurgitations is more reliably associated with CMR-based regurgitant volume by comparison with standard echocardiography diameter. CMR may provide useful evaluation before surgery decision for severe asymptomatic regurgitations.  "

Treatment of in-stent restenosis using excimer laser coronary atherectomy and bioresorbable vascular scaffold guided by optimal coherence tomography.  ;The rate of in-stent restenosis (ISR) has become increasingly prevalent with the exponential growth in stent implantation due to an aging population and a higher life expectancy, in addition to the high rates of obesity and diabetes. In this prospective, single operator, all-comer study, we sought to analyze the performance of ELCA followed by bioresorbable vascular scaffold (BVS) placement in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for ISR. A total of 13 patients had ISR treated with a combination of ELCA and BVS, with 9 patients having matched OCT pre, post ELCA and post BVS. Mean age was 65 ± 11.22 and 83% of the patients were male. Hypertension and dyslipidemia were present in 100% of the patients and smoking and diabetes in 50%. After the procedure, we did not detect residual stenosis over 10% in any patient, resulting in a technical success of 100%. No patients had MACE during their hospital stay or within the next six months, resulting in a procedure success of 100%. The mean lumen area increased 0.35 mm2 from pre procedure to post ELCA and 3.58 mm2 from post ELCA to post BVS. The final difference, from pre procedure to post BVS, was a 3.93 mm2 lumen area gain. The mean lumen diameter increased 0.11 mm from baseline to ELCA, 0.95 mm from post laser to BVS implantation and 1.06 mm from pre procedure to post BVS. The NIH area reduced 0.48 mm2 from pre to post ELCA, 1.13mm2 from post ELCA to BVS implantation and 1.61 mm2 from baseline to post BVS implantation. We conclude that ELCA is a safe and feasible debulking method to approach ISR, with high rates of post-procedural BVS success, within six months follow-up.  
Marked Up-Regulation of ACE2 in Hearts of Patients With Obstructive Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy: Implications for SARS-CoV-2-Mediated COVID-19.  ;"OBJECTIVE: To explore the transcriptomic differences between patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and controls. PATIENTS AND METHODS: RNA was extracted from cardiac tissue flash frozen at therapeutic surgical septal myectomy for 106 patients with HCM and 39 healthy donor hearts. Expression profiling of 37,846 genes was performed using the Illumina Human HT-12v3 Expression BeadChip. All patients with HCM were genotyped for pathogenic variants causing HCM. Technical validation was performed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blot. This study was started on January 1, 1999, and final analysis was completed on April 20, 2020. RESULTS: Overall, 22% of the transcriptome (8443 of 37,846 genes) was expressed differentially between HCM and control tissues. Analysis by genotype revealed that gene expression changes were similar among genotypic subgroups of HCM, with only 4% (1502 of 37,846) to 6% (2336 of 37,846) of the transcriptome exhibiting differential expression between genotypic subgroups. The qRT-PCR confirmed differential expression in 92% (11 of 12 genes) of tested transcripts. Notably, in the context of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the transcript for angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a negative regulator of the angiotensin system, was the single most up-regulated gene in HCM (fold-change, 3.53; q-value =1.30×10-23), which was confirmed by qRT-PCR in triplicate (fold change, 3.78; P=5.22×10-4), and Western blot confirmed greater than 5-fold overexpression of ACE2 protein (fold change, 5.34; P=1.66×10-6). CONCLUSION: More than 20% of the transcriptome is expressed differentially between HCM and control tissues. Importantly, ACE2 was the most up-regulated gene in HCM, indicating perhaps the heart's compensatory effort to mount an antihypertrophic, antifibrotic response. However, given that the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) uses ACE2 for viral entry, this 5-fold increase in ACE2 protein may confer increased risk for COVID-19 manifestations and outcomes in patients with increased ACE2 transcript expression and protein levels in the heart.

Cox-maze III procedure for atrial fibrillation during valve surgery: a single institution experience.  ;OBJECTIVES: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia in patients with heart valve disease. Our aim was to summarize our experience and evaluate the efficacy and safety of the Cox maze III procedure combined with valve surgery in patients with AF. METHODS: A retrospective, observational analysis was performed for all consecutive patients underwent maze III procedure combined with valve surgery between October 2015 and June 2019. In this trial, we used a monopolar radiofrequency (RF) ablation in addition to cut and sew technique to treat AF. RESULTS: 66 patients (37 female, 56.1%) with persistent or long-lasting persistent AF associated with valve disease were identified. The mean age was 54.2 ± 8.4 years (range, 30 to 73 years). Overall hospital mortality was 3.0%. The duration of cardiopulmonary bypass and aortic cross clamping was 175.4 ± 32.9 and 115.6 ± 22.8 min respectively. The first 24 h drainage was 488.6 ± 293.3 ml. The postoperative hospital stay was 14.8 ± 8.3 days. The postoperative incidence of permanent pacemaker implantation, reoperation for bleeding, renal failure required hemodialysis, and stroke was 4.5, 1.5, 4.5% and 0 respectively. The frequency of sinus rhythm was 91.7, 93.1, 94.7, 93.3 and 89.5% at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The Cox-Maze III procedure is safe in the surgical treatment of AF associated with valve disease, and efficacious for sinus rhythm maintenance, with low morbidity and mortality.  
Diagnosis and treatment of infective endocarditis in pregnancy: a case report.  ;BACKGROUND: Pregnancy with infective endocarditis (IE) is rare, but the fetal and maternal mortality rates of these pregnancies are very high, making IE a serious threat to the safety of pregnant women and their fetuses. Therefore, for pregnant women with recurrent fever, a detailed medical history and physical examination should be performed, echocardiography and blood culture should be carried out as soon as possible, multidisciplinary consultation should be implemented, and a diagnosis and treatment plan should be formulated right away, as this is key to saving the lives of mothers and infants. CASE INTRODUCTION: A 30-year-old pregnant Chinese woman had IE at 26 weeks of gestation. After close monitoring and care until 31 weeks of gestation, she underwent a successful delivery, cardiac surgery, repair of the patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), mitral valvuloplasty (MVP) and removal of the vegetations. The operation was successful, and further follow-up evaluation showed no abnormality. CONCLUSION: For the diagnosis and treatment of IE in pregnancy, it is of great importance to implement an individualized diagnosis and treatment plan in combination with close monitoring by echocardiography and to select the right time for cardiac surgery and termination of pregnancy.

Clinical Assessment of Perfusion Techniques During Surgical Repair of Coarctation of Aorta With Aortic Arch Hypoplasia in Neonates: A Pilot Prospective Randomized Study.  ;"We aimed to compare the safety and efficacy of 3 perfusion methods primarily used in aortic arch reconstruction in infants, namely, deep hypothermic circulatory arrest, selective antegrade cerebral perfusion, and double arterial cannulation. Forty-five infants with aortic arch obstruction and biventricular anatomy were enrolled in this pilot prospective study (ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT02835703). Patients were randomly assigned into 3 groups according to the perfusion strategy (deep hypothermic circulatory arrest, n = 15; selective antegrade cerebral perfusion, n = 15; double arterial cannulation, n = 15). The primary composite endpoint was the incidence of adverse events in the early postoperative period (acute kidney injury [KDIGO criteria], new brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings, and in-hospital mortality). The secondary endpoints were intensive care unit length of stay, vasoactive-inotropic score index, and cardiopulmonary bypass duration. All patients underwent aortic arch reconstruction under cardiopulmonary bypass and were monitored with near-infrared spectroscopy during surgery. No significant differences in the baseline characteristics and cardiopulmonary bypass duration were observed among the groups. The incidence of unfavorable events was lower in the double arterial cannulation group (P = 0.041). Acute kidney injury was observed in 8, 6, and 5 patients from the deep hypothermic circulatory arrest, selective antegrade cerebral perfusion, and double arterial cannulation groups, respectively (P = 0.64). Twelve patients from the deep hypothermic circulatory arrest group had new brain MRI findings (P = 0.019). There were 5 in-hospital deaths with no significant difference among the groups (P = 0.70). The ""head"" and ""lumbar"" values on near-infrared spectroscopy during aortic arch reconstruction were significantly higher in the selective antegrade cerebral perfusion and double arterial cannulation groups than in the deep hypothermic circulatory arrest group. Patients in the double arterial cannulation group had a significantly lower vasoactive-inotropic score index 24 hours postoperatively than the deep hypothermic circulatory arrest group (P = 0.03). Vasoactive-inotropic score index >12 was found to be a risk factor for acute kidney injury and early mortality. Continuous regional perfusion during aortic arch reconstruction decreases the risk of new brain MRI findings in infants and the need for postoperative inotropic support. Although values of near-infrared spectroscopy during the procedure were significantly higher with continuous perfusion strategies, these methods do not reduce the acute kidney injury incidence compared to that with deep hypothermic circulatory arrest. Double arterial cannulation significantly reduces the need for inotropic support.  "

Imaging aortic valve calcification: significance, approach and implications.  ;Aortic stenosis is the most prevalent valvular heart disease worldwide, and rates are increasing with the growing and more elderly population. Although the precise mechanisms that underpin aortic valve stenosis are incompletely understood, pathological valvular calcification has emerged as a key instigator in mediating the biomechanical stiffening that can lead to symptoms, the need for aortic valve replacement, and death if left untreated. Here, we review the currently understood processes leading to aortic valve calcification, summarise the contemporary imaging assessments of valve calcification, and highlight how these might improve patient care and accelerate our pathological understanding and the development of an effective medical therapy.  
Prosthetic aortic valve endocarditis complicated by COVID-19 and hemorrhage.  ;The novel coronavirus, now termed SARS-CoV-2, has caused a significant global impact in the space of 4 months. Almost all elective cardiac surgical operations have been postponed with only urgent and emergency operations being considered in order to maximise resource utilisation. We present a case of a 69-year old lady with an infected prosthetic aortic valve for consideration of urgent inpatient surgery. Despite being asymptomatic and testing negative initially for COVID-19 RT-PCR swab, further investigations with CT revealed suspicious findings. She subsequently tested positive on a repeat swab and unfortunately deteriorated rapidly with complications including gastro-intestinal and intracerebral haemorrhage.  
Pulmonary valve replacement after tetralogy of Fallot repair in a patient with immune thrombocytopenia.  ;Marked thrombocytopenia causes significant bleeding in cardiovascular surgery. Herein, we describe the case of a 47-year-old woman with immune thrombocytopenia who underwent successful pulmonary valve replacement for pulmonary valve regurgitation and stenosis after complete repair of tetralogy of Fallot. Her platelet count decreased significantly to less than 5 × 109 /L on postoperative day 3, thus multiple platelet transfusions were given. Pulse steroid therapy with dexamethasone was subsequently administered systemically for 4 days. After the treatment, her platelet count started to recover. There were no significant postoperative bleeding events, and red blood cell transfusion was not required. Other than the platelet event, the postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged on postoperative day 15.  
Impact of tricuspid annuloplasty on postoperative changes in the right ventricular systolic and diastolic function: A retrospective cohort study.  ;OBJECTIVES: To elucidate the impact of regulation of tricuspid regurgitation (TR) using tricuspid annuloplasty on postoperative changes in right ventricular (RV) systolic and diastolic functions. METHODS: We enrolled 69 patients who underwent aortic or mitral valve surgery between July 2016 to March 2018 without recurrence. Patients with concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting or a history of previous cardiovascular surgery were excluded, remaining 45 patients enrolled. Patients were divided into two groups according to concomitant tricuspid annuloplasty (T: n = 12 vs non-T: n = 33). RV global longitudinal strain (RVGLS), RV fractional area change (RVFAC), tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE), and early tricuspid inflow velocity/early diastolic tricuspid annular velocity ratio (tricuspid E/e') were assessed as functional indices at preoperative, postoperative and 1-year follow-up periods. RESULTS: RVFAC deteriorated postoperatively but recovered at follow-up in group T, whereas that in group non-T showed gradual deterioration overtime. RVGLS and TAPSE showed similar temporary deterioration and recovery between groups. Tricuspid E in group T increased postoperatively and showed significant difference, which was kept until follow-up period. Tricuspid e' decreased postoperatively, and recovered slightly in both groups. As a result, postoperative RV diastolic function (tricuspid E/e') showed significant difference between groups. This difference was maintained until follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: RV systolic function deteriorated postoperatively, but there was a tendency to improve at follow-up regardless of tricuspid annuloplasty. RV diastolic function may potentially be impaired when TR was regulated by tricuspid annuloplasty.  
Permanent pacemaker implantation rates following cardiac surgery in the modern era.  ;AIMS: The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of permanent pacemaker (PPM) implantation after cardiac surgery in our institution and investigate risk factors for PPM dependency to provide patients with accurate incidence figures at the time of consent for surgery. METHODS: Data was collected retrospectively from a single tertiary institution from October 2018 to April 2019 inclusive of 403 patients. Incidence of PPM implantation after various cardiac operations was evaluated. A univariate analysis was carried out to identify the independent risk factors related to PPM implantation. RESULTS: Ten patients required a PPM (2.48%). The most common indication for PPM implantation post-cardiac surgery was complete heart block (N = 7, 70%) followed by bradycardia/pauses (N = 2, 20%) and sick sinus syndrome (N = 1, 10%). PPM implantation after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery was the lowest (0.63%), while combined CABG and valve operations had the highest incidence (5.97%). Independent risk predictors for PPM implantation included female gender (p = 0.03), rheumatic heart disease (p = 0.008), pulmonary hypertension (p = 0.01), redo operations (p = 0.002), mitral valve procedures (p = 0.001), tricuspid valve procedures (p = 0.0003) and combined mitral and tricuspid valve procedures (p = 0.0001). Average length of intensive care unit (ICU)/high-dependency unit (HDU) stay was significantly prolonged for patients who required a PPM post-cardiac surgery. CONCLUSION: As clinicians, it can be challenging to provide our patients with accurate information on the risk of PPM implantation relative to their operation. A unit-specific data may be a more accurate method of informing our patients on this risk.  
Bacterial biofilms in infective endocarditis: an in vitro model to investigate emerging technologies of antimicrobial cardiovascular device coatings.  ;OBJECTIVE: In spite of the progress in antimicrobial and surgical therapy, infective endocarditis (IE) is still associated with a high morbidity and mortality. IE is characterized by bacterial biofilms of the endocardium, especially of the aortic and mitral valve leading to their destruction. About one quarter of patients with formal surgery indication cannot undergo surgery. This group of patients needs further options of therapy, but due to a lack of models for IE prospects of research are low. Therefore, the purpose of this project was to establish an in vitro model of infective endocarditis to allow growth of bacterial biofilms on porcine aortic valves, serving as baseline for further research. METHODS AND RESULTS: A pulsatile two-chamber circulation model was constructed that kept native porcine aortic valves under sterile, physiologic hemodynamic and temperature conditions. To create biofilms on porcine aortic valves the system was inoculated with Staphylococcus epidermidis PIA 8400. Aortic roots were incubated in the model for increasing periods of time (24 h and 40 h) and bacterial titration (1.5 × 104 CFU/mL and 1.5 × 105 CFU/mL) with 5 L cardiac output per minute. After incubation, tissue sections were analysed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for direct visualization of the biofilms. Pilot tests for biofilm growth showed monospecies colonization consisting of cocci with time- and inocula-dependent increase after 24 h and 40 h (n = 4). In n = 3 experiments for 24 h, with the same inocula, FISH visualized biofilms with ribosome-containing, and thus metabolic active cocci, tissue infiltration and similar colonization pattern as observed by the FISH in human IE heart valves infected by S. epidermidis. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate the establishment of a novel in vitro model for bacterial biofilm growth on porcine aortic roots mimicking IE. The model will allow to identify predilection sites of valves for bacterial adhesion and biofilm growth and it may serve as baseline for further research on IE therapy and prevention, e.g. the development of antimicrobial transcatheter approaches to IE.  
Hemodynamic Instability in Heart Failure Intensifies Age-Dependent Cognitive Decline.  ;"This review attempts to examine two key elements in the evolution of cognitive impairment in the elderly who develop heart failure. First, major left side heart parts can structurally and functionally deteriorate from aging wear and tear to provoke hemodynamic instability where heart failure worsens or is initiated; second, heart failure is a major inducer of cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease in the elderly. In heart failure, when the left ventricular myocardium of an elderly person does not properly contract, it cannot pump out adequate blood to the brain, raising the risk of cognitive impairment due to the intensification of chronic brain hypoperfusion. Chronic brain hypoperfusion originates from chronically reduced cardiac output which progresses as heart failure worsens. Other left ventricular heart parts, including atrium, valves, myocardium, and aorta can contribute to the physiological shortfall of cardiac output. It follows that hemodynamic instability and perfusion changes occurring from the aging heart's blood pumping deficiency will, in time, damage vulnerable brain cells linked to specific cognitive regulatory sites, diminishing neuronal energy metabolism to a level where progressive cognitive impairment is the outcome. Could cognitive impairment progress be reversed with a heart transplant? Evidence is presented detailing the errant hemodynamic pathways leading to cognitive impairment during aging as an offshoot of inefficient structural and functional heart parts and their contribution to heart failure.

Redistribution of cardiac output during exercise by functional mitral regurgitation in heart failure: compensatory O(2) peripheral uptake to delivery failure.  ;"Functional mitral regurgitation (MR) is prognostic in heart failure (HF). MR favors an nonphysiological exercise central cardiac output (CO) redistribution which adds to oxygen (O2) delivery failure. The consequences of this redistribution in O2 supply have not been explored previously. We aimed at evaluating the putative role of cardiac output (CO) and O2 arteriovenous [C(a-v)O2] difference in the attained peak V̇o2 in advanced HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and MR. 134 HFrEF patients and 80 controls with no HF underwent exercise gas exchange combined with CO and C(a-v)O2 estimated by echo-Doppler technique. The HF population was divided into two groups: HF with severe rest MR (MR+ group; n = 36) and no to mild MR (MR- group; n = 98). HF groups did not differ in rest CO (MR+ vs. MR- 3.4 ± 1.8 vs. 3.8 ± 1.0 L/min; P = 0.32) and showed a trend for a higher C(a-v)O2 at rest (9.0 ± 4.0 vs. 8.0 ± 2.0 mL O2/100 mL; P = 0.14). In HF, CO and C(a-v)O2 at rest were significantly lower and higher compared with controls. At peak exercise, MR+ compared with MR- exhibited a significant reduction in peak V̇o2 11.6 ± 3.0 vs. 13.7 ± 3.6 ml O2·kg-1·min-1; P < 0.01) with a lower O2 delivery (CO: 5.2 ± 3.3 vs. 7.0 ± 2.0 L/min; P < 0.01), which was partially compensated by a significantly greater O2 extraction [C(a-v)O2, 18 ± 5 vs. 15 ± 4 mL O2/100 mL; P < 0.01]. In HFrEF, severe MR is associated with impaired O2 delivery due to CO redistribution to the pulmonary circulation. C(a-v)O2 is maximalized to compensate for the reduced O2 delivery. This novel information is relevant to phenotyping and targeting mediators of functional response in HF. Specifically, findings provide directions in the understanding at which extent mitral valve repair would restore an efficient cardiac reserve by enhancing O2 delivery during exercise, likely contributing to symptom relief and hopefully impacting the clinical trajectory of HF syndrome with secondary MR.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This is an analysis involving 134 heart failure patients with reduced ejection fraction versus 80 controls investigated during functional evaluation with gas exchange and hemodynamic, addressing the severe MR phenotype and testing the hypothesis that the backward cardiac output redistribution to the lung during exercise impairs delivery and overexpresses peripheral extraction. This information is new and has important implications in the management of heart failure.  "
Oral batyl alcohol supplementation rescues decreased cardiac conduction in ether phospholipid-deficient mice.  ;Plasmalogens (Pls) are a class of membrane phospholipids which serve a number of essential biological functions. Deficiency of Pls is associated with common disorders such as Alzheimer's disease or ischemic heart disease. A complete lack of Pls due to genetically determined defective biosynthesis gives rise to rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata (RCDP), characterized by a number of severe disabling pathologic features and death in early childhood. Frequent cardiac manifestations of RCDP include septal defects, mitral valve prolapse, and patent ductus arteriosus. In a mouse model of RCDP, reduced nerve conduction velocity was partially rescued by dietary oral supplementation of the Pls precursor batyl alcohol (BA). Here, we examine the impact of Pls deficiency on cardiac impulse conduction in a similar mouse model (Gnpat KO). In-vivo electrocardiographic recordings showed that the duration of the QRS complex was significantly longer in Gnpat KO mice than in age- and sex-matched wild-type animals, indicative of reduced cardiac conduction velocity. Oral supplementation of BA for 2 months resulted in normalization of cardiac Pls levels and of the QRS duration in Gnpat KO mice but not in untreated animals. BA treatment had no effect on the QRS duration in age-matched wild-type mice. These data suggest that Pls deficiency is associated with increased ventricular conduction time which can be rescued by oral BA supplementation.  
Feasibility Study of Advanced Cardiovascular Screening in Middle-Aged Patients with Diabetes.  ;"PURPOSE: Cardiovascular mortality remains high among patients with diabetes compared with the general population. The primary aim was to evaluate the interest in and demand for advanced cardiovascular screening in patients with diabetes; the secondary aim was to explore its efficiency in detecting unprotected subclinical cardiovascular disease (CVD). PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a cross-sectional design, randomly selected 40-60-year-old men and women with diabetes were invited to the screening trial. Screening encompassed (1) a comprehensive medical interview; (2) non-contrast computed tomography scanning to quantify coronary artery and aortic valve calcification, to measure left atrial size, to assess heart rhythm and to detect aortic and iliac dilatations; (3) ankle and brachial blood pressure measurements; and (4) blood and urine samples for measurements of HbA1c, lipid profile, renal function, NT-pro B-type natriuretic peptide (pro-BNP) and albuminuria. Primary outcome was participation rate; secondary outcome was rate of unprotected subclinical CVD. RESULTS: Of 465 invited patients, 191 (41.1%) attended screening. The participation rate was 40% (95% CI:33-47) for males and 42% (95% CI:36-48) for females. Twenty-four patients were excluded due to previous CVD. The remaining patients' mean age was 52 years; 58% were males. Subclinical CVD was found in 64%, with a male preponderance (males 75% (95% CI:66-83; females 49% (95% CI:37-60)). Presence of severe coronary artery calcification (score ≥ 400) showed a male preponderance (males 19% (95% CI:12-27); females 7% (95% CI:3-16)). Aortic valve calcification, enlarged left atrial volume, atrial fibrillation, aortic dilatations, peripheral artery disease or increased pro-BNP were uncommon, and without any sex differences. Unprotected subclinical CVD was very common, and medical treatment was intensified in 60% (95% CI:53-68) of patients. CONCLUSION: We propose a feasible cardiovascular screening examination from which middle-aged patients with diabetes may benefit. However, the participation rate may be too low to warrant screening.

Is there a role for blood purification therapies targeting cytokine storm syndrome in critically severe COVID-19 patients?  ;The coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) has spread over many countries and regions since the end of 2019, becoming the most severe public health event at present. Most of the critical cases developed multiple organ dysfunction, including acute kidney injury (AKI). Cytokine storm syndrome (CSS) may complicate the process of severe COVID-19 patients. This manuscript reviews the different aspects of blood purification in critically ill patients with AKI and increased inflammatory factors, and examines its potential role in severe COVID-19 treatment. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) has been practiced in many sepsis patients with AKI. Still, the timing and dosing need further robust evidence. In addition to the traditional CRRT, the high-throughput membrane with adsorption function and cytokine adsorption column are two representatives of recently emerging novel membrane technologies. Their potential in removing inflammatory factors and other toxins prospects for the treatment of severe COVID-19.  
The snared wire technique for Sapien valve implantation in the pulmonary position.  ;OBJECTIVES: Description of the snared wire technique (SWT) to facilitate the delivery of the Sapien valve in pulmonary position, and comparison with standard delivery technique. BACKGROUND: Transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement (TPVR) with the Sapien delivery system has proven to be challenging. Therefore, alternative strategies for facilitating its delivery in this position are needed. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of patients who underwent TPVR with or without the new SWT. The SWT was chosen as an elective strategy when the anatomy was judged to be challenging for TPVR (planned SWT) or as a rescue strategy when a standard delivery failed (rescue SWT). RESULTS: From February 2018 to January 2020, 84 patients underwent TPVR with a Sapien S3 valve using either a standard delivery (n = 63, 75%) or a SWT (n = 21, 25%). Fifteen patients underwent a planned SWT, six patients underwent a rescue SWT after failure of a standard delivery. All planned SWT cases were successful and, compared to the standard delivery group, no significant differences were found in terms of time to valve-deployment, fluoroscopy time, procedure time, or frequency of complications. Rescue SWT cases had longer fluoroscopy time (p = .05), longer time to valve-deployment (p = .0001), and higher frequency of complications (p = .002) including tricuspid valve injury (p = .0004), but allowed the operator to successfully implant the valve into the desired location. CONCLUSIONS: Even in the most challenging anatomies, the SWT represents a feasible and effective alternative strategy for TPVR with the Sapien valve that should be considered when other techniques have failed.  
Rheumatic mitral valve repair: a personal perspective and results.  ;Rheumatic mitral valve disease remains a challenge for cardiac surgeons. Valve repair has several advantages over valve replacement but is technically demanding for good results. To improve rheumatic mitral valve repair, surgeons need to have a deep understand of the mitral valve complex and its dynamics. The goal of repair is to restore normal diastolic and systolic function. The current approach is to perform a holistic repair of the entire mitral complex. Each part of the complex is thoroughly explored to define the problem. Several innovative techniques have been introduced to correct valve dysfunction and provide gratifying results. The details of these techniques will be described, based on an understanding of the relationship of the mitral valve complex and dynamics. With this approach, rheumatic mitral valve repair is becoming more successful, reproducible, and safe. Long-term follow-up is mandatory.  
Minimally invasive surgical aortic valve replacement through a right anterolateral thoracotomy.  ;In the field of minimally invasive surgical aortic valve replacement, the right anterolateral minithoracotomy is an approach that offers very limited procedural trauma. Our method of right anterolateral minithoracotomy uses femoral percutaneous cannulation, a high-definition thoracoscope and a transthoracic cross-clamp. It allows a minimized skin incision and full preservation of the sternum, sternocostal cartilages, and ribs. The patient we present in this video tutorial is a low-risk male with severe bicuspid aortic valve stenosis. We provide detailed insight into our preoperative planning and step-by-step guidance throughout the right anterolateral minithoracotomy aortic valve replacement procedure.  
Isolated bicuspid aortic valve repair with double annuloplasty: The French approach.  ;Isolated aortic valve repair is an alternative to aortic valve replacement in patients with severe aortic regurgitation. It reduces the risk of prosthesis-related complications, such as thromboembolism and endocarditis, and there is no need for long-term oral anticoagulation. However, repair techniques are technically demanding, especially in bicuspid aortic valves.  
Video assisted thoracoscopic sympathectomy for intractable recurrent VT after minimal-invasive LVAD implantation.  ;BACKGROUND: Recurrent ventricular tachycardia (VT) can occur after left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation. In this case, medical treatment might be insufficient. We report a case of a left-sided thoracoscopic sympathectomy as a feasible treatment escalation in intractable VT. CASE REPORT: A 72-year-old patient underwent an internal cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) implantation as primary prophylaxis for VTs in the setting of staged heart failure therapy. Afterwards, due to a progressive dilative cardiomyopathy he underwent a minimal-invasive LVAD implantation (HeartWare, Medtronic). After an uneventful minimal-invasive LVAD-implantation the patient was discharged to a rehabilitation program. However, after 7 weeks he developed recurrent VTs which were successfully terminated by ICD shocks deliveries leading to severe discomfort and frequent hospitalizations. Eventually, the patient was admitted with an electrical VT storm. Successful endocardial catheter ablation of all inducible VTs were performed combined with multiple rearrangements of his oral antiarrhythmic medication. However, all these treatments could not suppress further occurrence of VTs. After an interdisciplinary discussion the patient agreed to a left-sided video-assisted thoracoscopic sympathectomy. After a follow up of 150 days the patient was free from VTs apart from one short event. CONCLUSION: We believe video-assisted thoracoscopic sympathectomy might be a surgical treatment option in patients with intractable recurrent VTs after catheter ablation of VT reentrant substrate even after minimal-invasive LVAD implantation.  
Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance and Sport Cardiology: a Growing Role in Clinical Dilemmas.  ;"Exercise training induces morphological and functional cardiovascular adaptation known as the ""athlete's heart"" with changes including dilatation, hypertrophy, and increased stroke volume. These changes may overlap with pathological appearances. Distinguishing athletic cardiac remodelling from cardiomyopathy is important and is a frequent medical dilemma. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) has a role in clinical care as it can refine discrimination of health from a disease where ECG and echocardiography alone have left or generated uncertainty. CMR can more precisely assess cardiac structure and function as well as characterise the myocardium detecting key changes including myocardial scar and diffuse fibrosis. In this review, we will review the role of CMR in sports cardiology.  "
Readmissions Rates After Myocardial Infarction for Gastrointestinal Bleeding: A National Perspective.  ;BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is one most common complications of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). We aimed to determine the incidence, in-hospital outcomes, associated healthcare burden and predictors of GI bleeding within 30 days after AMI. METHODS: Data were extracted from Nationwide Readmission Database 2010-2014. Patients were included if they had a primary diagnosis of ST or non-ST elevation myocardial infarction. Exclusion criteria were admissioned in December, aged less than 18 years and a diagnosis of type-2 MI. The primary outcome was 30-day readmission with upper or lower GI bleeding. Secondary outcomes were in-hospital mortality, etiology of bleeding, in-hospital complications, procedures, length of stay, and total hospitalization charges. Independent predictors of readmission were identified using multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Out of the 3,520,241 patients discharged with ACS, 10,018 (0.3%) were readmitted with GI bleeding within 30 days of discharge. 60% had lower GI bleeding. Most common sources suspected were GI cancers in 17% and hemorrhoidal bleeding in 10%. In hospital mortality rate for readmission was 3.6%. Independent predictors of readmission were age, Charlson comorbidity score, history of chronic kidney disease, GI tumor, inflammatory bowel disease and artificial heart valve. Type of treatment for AMI had no impact on readmission. Patients readmitted had higher rates of shock (adjusted odds ratio, 1.48, 95% CI 1.01-3.72). CONCLUSIONS: In the first nationwide study, 30-day incidence of GI bleeding after AMI is 0.3%. GI bleeding complicating AMI carries a substantial in-hospital mortality and cost of care.  
Fibrinolysis and the Influence of Tranexamic Acid Dosing in Cardiac Surgery.  ;OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to determine whether underlying disease, performed surgery, and dose of tranexamic acid influence fibrinolysis measured with D-dimer levels. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis. SETTING: Single institution (Department of Cardiac Surgery and Section of Clinical Hemostaseology at the Düsseldorf University Hospital). PARTICIPANTS: The study comprised 3,152 adult patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery between February 2013 and October 2016. INTERVENTIONS: Two doses of tranexamic acid during surgery were administered. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: D-dimer levels were analyzed at the start of surgery and before protamine administration. D-dimer levels at the start of surgery were compared according to disease. Intraoperative D-dimer development was analyzed according to the type of surgery and within 2 cohorts with different tranexamic acid doses. Interindividual variability was pronounced for D-dimer levels at the start of surgery, with significant differences among patients with coronary artery disease, valve disease, and aortic disease and patients undergoing heart transplantation compared with patients receiving a left ventricular assist device (p < 0.01). Aortic dissection, endocarditis, and extracorporeal life support were associated with higher D-dimer levels (p ≤ 0.01). With tranexamic acid at a fixed dose, intraoperative D-dimer levels decreased in on-pump and off-pump coronary bypass surgery, valve surgery, and left ventricular assist device surgery (p ≤ 0.02), but levels increased in aortic surgery and heart transplantations (p < 0.01). A decrease or increase in D-dimer levels during surgery was influenced significantly by a higher or lower tranexamic acid dose (p ≤ 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: D-dimer testing allows for the assessment of individual fibrinolytic activity in cardiac surgery, which is influenced by disease type, surgery type, and dose of tranexamic acid. The assessment of the fibrinolytic status may have the potential to facilitate dose-adjusted antifibrinolytic therapy in the future.  
Normalization of the right heart and the preoperative factors that influence the emergence PAH after surgical closure of atrial septal defect.  ;BACKGROUND: Surgical closure of atrial septal defect (ASD) is contraindicated in the condition with severe pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), whereas ASD closure in an effective intervention to normalize the structure and function of the right heart after previously experiencing volume overload due to shunting from the defect. This study aimed to evaluate normalization of the right heart and emergence of PAH after surgical closure of ASD. METHODS: This retrospective study was carried out in 45 patients over 18 years who had undergone surgical closure of ASD. The study has the aim to evaluate the morphological and functional parameters before and after the surgical approach and the preoperative factors that influenced the development of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAP) after the ASD closure. RESULTS: The majority of subjects were female (73.3%) although there were no significant differences between males and females from the various parameters. The average of mPAP in the group that experienced PAH was higher than non-PAH group after ASD closure (p = 0.019, 31.23 ± 12.70 mmHg vs 24.07 ± 13.08 mmHg). Significant differences were found in the Right Atrium (RA) dimension, Right Ventricle (RV) dimension, Tricuspid Regurgitation Velocity (TRV) and Tricuspid Annular Plane Systolic Excursion (TAPSE) between before and at 6 months after ASD closure (p = 0.000, p = 0.000, p = 0.000, p = 000, respectively). The sensitivity of the predictive model to estimate PAH at 6 months after surgical closure of ASD was 58%, with a specificity of 62.5%. CONCLUSION: Structural and functional normalization of the right heart occurs at 6 months after surgical closure of ASD with the decrease of RA and RV dimensions and improvement from tricuspid regurgitation. Emergence of PAH after ASD closure was influenced by higher mPAP before surgical approach.  
Successful Fibrinolytic Therapy in a Challenging Obstructive Prosthetic Mitral Valve Thrombosis.  ;Prosthetic valve thrombosis is a rare and severe complication of the mechanical prosthetic valve. Management can be challenging due to varying clinical presentation, overlapping features of differential diagnosis, and lack of randomized controlled trials on the therapeutic options. In this article, we report the case of a patient with a mechanical prosthetic mitral valve presented with symptoms of heart failure, and an echocardiography showing increased mean pressure gradient across the prosthesis along with a fixed posterior leaflet and a partially restricted anterior leaflet with no visible mass. That raised the concern for an obstructed prosthesis. After multimodality imaging and multidisciplinary team discussions, prosthetic valve thrombosis diagnosis was favored over other different diagnoses that included but not limited to pannus ingrowth. Fibrinolytic therapy was administrated, and the patient was discharged on optimal anticoagulation. Repeated echocardiography a month later showed normal mean gradient and normal functioning prosthetic mitral valve without the need for repeat mitral valve surgery.  
Lung Volume Reduction in Pulmonary Emphysema.  ;Severe emphysema with hyperinflation presents a therapeutic challenge. Inhaled medication has limited efficacy in individuals with mechanical constraints to the respiratory pump and impaired gas exchange. Lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) reestablishes some semblance of normal physiology, resecting grossly expanded severely diseased tissue to restore the function of compromised relatively healthy lung, and has been shown to significantly improve exercise capacity, quality of life, and survival, especially in individuals with upper-lobe predominant emphysema and low-baseline exercise capacity, albeit with higher early morbidity and mortality. Bronchoscopic lung volume reduction achieved by deflating nonfunctioning parts of the lung is promoted as a less invasive and safer approach. Endobronchial valve implantation has demonstrated comparable outcomes to LVRS in selected individuals and has recently received approvals by the National Institute of Clinical Excellence in the United Kingdom and the Food and Drug Administration in the United States of America. Endobronchial coils are proving a viable treatment option in severe hyperinflation in the presence of collateral ventilation in selected cases of homogeneous disease. Modalities including vapor and sealant are delivered using a segmental strategy preserving healthier tissue within the same target lobe-efficacy and safety-data are, however, limited. This article will review the data supporting these novel technologies.  
Cardiac tissue remodeling in healthy aging: the road to pathology.  ;"This review aims to highlight the normal physiological remodeling that occurs in healthy aging hearts, including changes that occur in contractility, conduction, valve function, large and small coronary vessels, and the extracellular matrix. These ""normal"" age-related changes serve as the foundation that supports decreased plasticity and limited ability for tissue remodeling during pathophysiological states such as myocardial ischemia and heart failure. This review will identify populations at greater risk for poor tissue remodeling in advanced age along with present and future therapeutic strategies that may ameliorate dysfunctional tissue remodeling in aging hearts.

Imaging and Patient Selection for Transcatheter Tricuspid Valve Interventions.  ;With the emergence of transcatheter solutions for the treatment of tricuspid regurgitation (TR) increased attention has been directed to the once neglected tricuspid valve (TV) complex. Recent studies have highlighted new aspects of valve anatomy and TR etiology. The assessment of valve morphology along with quantification of regurgitation severity and RV function pose several challenges to cardiac imagers guiding transcatheter valve procedures. This review article aims to give an overview over the role of modern imaging modalities during assessment and treatment of the TV.  
Atrial Tissue Pro-Fibrotic M2 Macrophage Marker CD163+, Gene Expression of Procollagen and B-Type Natriuretic Peptide.  ;Background Atrial tissue fibrosis is linked to inflammatory cells, yet is incompletely understood. A growing body of literature associates peripheral blood levels of the antifibrotic hormone BNP (B-type natriuretic peptide) with atrial fibrillation (AF). We investigated the relationship between pro-fibrotic tissue M2 macrophage marker Cluster of Differentiation (CD)163+, atrial procollagen expression, and BNP gene expression in patients with and without AF. Methods and Results In a cross-sectional study design, right atrial tissue was procured from 37 consecutive, consenting, stable patients without heart failure or left ventricular systolic dysfunction, of whom 10 had AF and 27 were non-AF controls. Samples were analyzed for BNP and fibro-inflammatory gene expression, as well as fibrosis and CD163+. Primary analyses showed strong correlations (all P<0.008) between M2 macrophage CD163+ staining, procollagen gene expression, and myocardial BNP gene expression across the entire cohort. In secondary analyses without multiplicity adjustments, AF patients had greater left atrial volume index, more valve disease, higher serum BNP, and altered collagen turnover markers versus controls (all P<0.05). AF patients also showed higher atrial tissue M2 macrophage CD163+, collagen volume fraction, gene expression of procollagen 1 and 3, as well as reduced expression of the BNP clearance receptor NPRC (all P<0.05). Atrial procollagen 3 gene expression was correlated with fibrosis and BNP gene expression was correlated with serum BNP. Conclusions Elevated atrial tissue pro-fibrotic M2 macrophage CD163+ is associated with increased myocardial gene expression of procollagen and anti-fibrotic BNP and is higher in patients with AF. More work on modulation of BNP signaling for treatment and prevention of AF may be warranted.  
Overcoming challenges in the management of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy.  ;Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) appears in most patients to be an inherited disease characterized by fibrofatty replacement of myocytes extending from the epicardium to the endocardium in the right ventricle. The disease process results in life‑threatening ventricular arrhythmias and ventricular dysfunction. In the absence of a gold‑standard diagnostic test and despite the progress in imaging techniques, ARVC is often misdiagnosed and earlier detection of the disease is challenging. Preprocedural identification and localization of the substrate can be determined from the analysis of surface electrocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. Typically, perivalvular arrhythmogenic substrate, defined by electroanatomic mapping, is present and can be isolated to the epicardium. Ablation targets are further identified with activation, entrainment, and local electrogram abnormalities based on detailed electroanatomic mapping. Extensive combined endo / epicardial ablation performed in experienced centers is frequently required to prevent ventricular tachycardia (VT). Catheter ablation significantly reduces recurrences of VT, appropriate implantable cardioverter‑defibrillator shocks, and the use of antiarrhythmic drugs and cardiac transplant as a management strategy for refractory arrhythmias is rarely required. Progression of the disease is poorly understood and may require a distinct triggering mechanism. Biventricular involvement is more common than previously recognized. However, left ventricular involvement leading to significant terminal heart failure is fortunately uncommon and left ventricular tachycardias are also infrequent. Many questions remain regarding prevention and management of coexisting tricuspid valve regurgitation, atrial arrhythmias, and intracardiac thrombosis. Although data on genotype‑phenotype correlations is growing, long‑term follow‑up studies of families with ARVC are still lacking. Ongoing research will contribute to better understanding of this pathological condition.  
Adult Monozygotic Twins With Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy and Identical Disease Expression and Clinical Course.  ;A unique clinical circumstance involving middle-aged male identical twins with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HC) is reported. The concordance of morphologic (i.e., phenotype) findings and clinical course between the 2 patients is remarkable, including timing of the onset and progression of heart failure due to left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, frequency of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and beneficial response to surgical myectomy and Cox-Maze IV procedure (performed 14 days apart). Histopathology of resected ventricular septal muscle showed identical hallmarks of HC including myocyte disorganization, small vessel disease, and myocardial fibrosis. A missense variant of the CRYAB gene was identified as potentially relevant to the pathogenesis of HC in the twins. Taken together, these observations support a powerful genetic determinant for the morphologic and clinical expression of HC, with little or no environmental influence.  
Simplifying Physiological Left Bundle Branch Area Pacing Using a New Nine-Partition Method.  ;"BACKGROUND: Left bundle branch area pacing (LBBaP) is accepted as a physiological form of pacing; however, it is complex and usually requires an expensive electrophysiological recording system. METHODS: A simplified approach (""9-partition method"") was explored to perform LBBaP. In this method, a right anterior oblique 30° fluoroscopic image of the ventricle was divided into 9 sections (""3 × 3"" partitions). From May 2018 to February 2019, we enrolled 51 consecutive patients who underwent pacemaker implantation. The patients were nonrandomly allocated to either the conventional LBBaP (c-LBBaP) group or simplified LBBaP (s-LBBaP) group. RESULTS: The mean age was 68.53 ± 11.90 years, and 32 (62.7%) patients were male. The overall success rate was 90.2% (46/51). Compared with the c-LBBaP group, the s-LBBaP group had a significantly lower total procedure duration (91.57 ± 19.51 minutes vs 70.68 ± 13.26 minutes; P < 0.001) and fluoroscopy duration (16.52 ± 5.34 minutes vs 10.54 ± 3.13 minutes; P < 0.001). The time from the 3830 lead and sheath passage through the tricuspid valve to an acceptable initial fixation site (4.69 ± 1.61 minutes vs 2.75 ± 1.04 minutes; P < 0.001) and the time to the left bundle branch lead being implanted successfully (11.78 ± 3.00 minutes vs 7.67 ± 2.45 minutes; P < 0.001) for the c-LBBaP vs s-LBBaP groups, respectively, were significantly different. After 3 months, there were no significant differences in the capture threshold, R wave amplitude, impedance, or QRS duration between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the c-LBBaP approach, our simplified 9-partition method was faster and did not require an expensive electrophysiological recording system.  "

Serum proteome profiling in canine chronic valve disease using a TMT-based quantitative proteomics approach.  ;Chronic valve disease (CVD) is the most common clinically significant heart disease of dogs, affecting 20 to 40% of dogs. The aim of this study was to evaluate the serum protein profile of healthy and CVD affected dogs, by means of an isobaric tandem mass tag (TMT) label-based high-resolution quantitative proteomic approach. Additionally, conventional cardiac biomarkers were measured in the serum, functional bioinformatics analysis was employed for elucidating molecular mechanisms and pathways associated with CVD, and validation of proteomic results was performed by immunoassays and Western blotting. Of 290 identified and quantified proteins, 15 proteins showed significantly different abundances (p < .05), including antithrombin-III, alpha-2-antiplasmin, tetranectin, apolipoprotein M, adiponectin, inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain H1, gelsolin and apolipoprotein B-100. The identified proteins with differently abundances are involved in a number of pathways, such as complement and coagulation cascades, haemostasis, regulation of actin cytoskeleton, lipid metabolism and transport. We found comparative similarities with human disease in terms of identified proteins and GO pathways, which confirmed similar pathophysiology of this disease, but also differences, mainly in lipid metabolism. SIGNIFICANCE: There have been few investigations of canine serum proteome despite the potential for biomarker discovery and comparative disease analysis. Establishing serum proteomic signatures in healthy dogs and dogs with CVD will benefit for understanding the aetiology of disease in dogs, identify putative biomarkers and provide models of comparative human disease. Circulating biomarkers are important for understanding of the mechanisms of cardiovascular disease and high incidence of CVD in dogs prioritizes the search for novel biomarkers.  
Systematic review and meta-analysis of valve-in-valve transcatheter aortic valve replacement in patients with failed bioprosthetic aortic valves.  ;AIMS: The aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the evidence regarding the rates of procedural success and the incidence of adverse outcomes following valve-in-valve (VIV) transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in patients with failed bioprosthetic aortic valves. METHODS AND RESULTS: A systematic search of major electronic databases was conducted for studies relevant to patients with failed bioprosthetic aortic valves undergoing VIV-TAVR. The primary outcome was procedural success. A total of 5,553 patients from 24 studies were included. The mean Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) score was 7.84±5.14. The procedural success rate was high (97%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 94-98%). At 30 days, all-cause mortality was 5% (95% CI: 3-6%), stroke 2% (95% CI: 1-2%), myocardial infarction 1% (95% CI: 1-2%), permanent pacemaker placement 6% (95% CI: 5-8%), and aortic regurgitation 7% (95% CI: 5-10%). At one year, the incidence of all-cause mortality was 12% (95% CI: 10-14%), stroke 3% (95% CI: 2-4%), myocardial infarction 1% (95% CI: 0-2%), and permanent pacemaker placement 7% (95% CI: 5-11%). At three years, the incidence of all-cause mortality was 29% (95% CI: 25-34%) and stroke 6% (95% CI: 5-9%). CONCLUSIONS: VIV-TAVR appears to be associated with high procedural success rates and low adverse outcomes during the short-term and midterm follow-up period.

A glimpse of hope: cardiac surgery in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).  ;"Currently, more than five times more people live in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) than in high-income countries (HICs). As such, the downward trend in cardiac surgical needs in HICs reflects only the situation of one sixth of the world population while the vast majority living in LMICs has still no or limited access to life saving heart operations. In these countries, rheumatic heart disease (RHD) still accounts for a significant proportion of cardiac surgical needs. In low- and lower-middle income countries it remains the single most common cardiovascular disease in young adult and adolescent patients in need of heart surgery outweighing other indications such as congenital cardiac defects almost 4-fold. Compared to HICs with their predominance of calcific aortic stenosis in the elderly mitral valve surgery is required in >90% of the largely young patients with RHD in low-income countries (LICs) and still in 70% of the often middle aged patients in middle-income countries (MICs). Although recent government initiatives in LICs led to the establishment of local, independent cardiac surgical services gradually replacing fly-in missions, these centers still only cover less than 2% of the needs of their populations. In MICs, cardiac surgical needs continually grow with the emergence of degenerative diseases. As such, in spite of the concomitant growth of cardiac surgical capacity, significantly less than half the estimated patients in need have access. Capacities in LICs range from 0.5 to 7 cardiac operations/million population; 100-481/million in MICs and >1,200/million in HICs such as the USA and Germany. While a new level of awareness of the scope and magnitude of the problem has begun to emerge in LICs and the establishment of local cardiac surgical capacity has given rise to a glimpse of hope, the challenges of expanding these fledgling services to a significant proportion of the population still seem insurmountable. Challenges in MICs are on the other hand the widening gap between private cardiac medicine for the affluent few and overwhelmed public services for the many and the rural urban divide with the underappreciation of the ongoing dominance of RHD in the rural and indigent population on the other. Overshadowing all LMICs is the low level of valve-repair skills associated with insufficient cardiac surgical capacity and the unavailability of suitable replacement valves which address the young age of the patients and the difficulties of anticoagulation in a socioeconomic environment distinctly different from the elderly patients of HICs.

Rheumatic heart disease: current status of diagnosis and therapy.  ;Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) is the only preventable cardiovascular disease which causes significant morbidity and mortality particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Early clinical diagnosis is key, the updated Jones criteria increases the likelihood of diagnosis in endemic settings, including the echo diagnosis of sub-clinical carditis, polyarthralgia and monoarthritis as well as amended thresholds of minor criteria. The mainstay of rheumatic heart valve disease (RHVD) is a thorough clinical and echocardiographic investigation while severe disease is managed with medical, interventional and surgical treatment. In this report we detail some of the more recent epidemiological findings and focus on the diagnostic and interventional elements of the specific valve lesions. Finally, we discuss some of the recent efforts to improve medical and surgical management for this disease. As we are already more than a year from the historic 2018 World Heart Organization Resolution against Rheumatic Fever and Rheumatic Heart Disease, we advocate strongly for renewed efforts to prioritize this disease across the endemic regions of the world.  
Challenges in addressing the knowledge gap on endomyocardial fibrosis through community-based studies.  ;Endomyocardial fibrosis (EMF) is a poverty-related disease of unknown origin that afflicts predominantly young people of certain rural areas in low-income countries and can be used to expose global disparities in cardiovascular research. Despite affecting predominantly young people and causing high morbidity and mortality, efforts to understand its mechanisms and natural history have been hampered by the incapacity to detect the early stages of the disease in endemic areas. Dietary, environmental and infectious factors seem to combine in susceptible individuals to give rise to an inflammatory process that leads to endomyocardial damage and scar formation. Lack of awareness by health professionals and low access to health care determine late diagnosis, when complications such as chronic heart failure, thromboembolism and arrhythmia are already present. Open-heart surgery to detach the endocardial fibrous tissue and repair the atrioventricular valve, remains the last resource to prolong patients' survival. Community-based research is therefore needed to understand the epidemiology of EMF, detect early disease, uncover its pathogenesis and explore new therapeutic targets. Our research has shown that echocardiographic screening using standard criteria adds sensitivity and precision to the diagnosis, particularly in asymptomatic disease, providing an opportunity for longitudinal community-based research. However, researchers face major constraints in rural settings where EMF is endemic, including socioeconomic, cultural, geographical and administrative barriers. In presenting our experience we aim to describe the challenges and discuss the lessons learned while implementing community-based research in a highly endemic area in southern Mozambique, one of the poorest countries in the world. Additionally, we discuss how recent advances in medicine-such as use of point-of-care diagnostics, heart failure biomarkers and new imaging techniques-may open new possibilities for high quality research through collaborative partnerships and regional initiatives.  
Infective endocarditis in South Africa.  ;Infective endocarditis (IE) is defined by infection of either a native or prosthetic heart valve, endocardial surface or any cardiac prosthetic device. It is a disease of both the developed and developing world, although IE has evolved in the developed world to a disease markedly different to the disease encountered in the developing world. IE in developed nations is mainly a disease of older patients with degenerative heart valve disease or cardiac prosthetic material, with virulent Staphylococci the most common causative organism. Data regarding the epidemiology of IE in South Africa, a developing country, is limited. The available data suggest it is still a disease of younger patients with rheumatic heart disease (RHD), associated with penicillin-sensitive Streptococcal infection. Although novel diagnostic techniques and improved therapeutic options has emerged, the 1-year mortality rate has remained high in both the developed and developing world at around 30%.  
Endomyocardial fibrosis.  ;"BACKGROUND: Endomyocardial fibrosis (EMF) is a neglected cardiovascular disease of poverty which carries a poor prognosis with no specific treatment affecting mainly children and young adults. Here, we report our 10-year experience in the therapeutic management and surgical treatment for EMF. METHODS: From February 2009 to 2019 March, 55 patients diagnosed with EMF from our cardiology unit underwent surgical repair at our department's pediatric surgical division. There were 35 male, and 20 female patients whose ages varied from 1 year 2 months to 12 years mean age 5.7 (±3.2). We designed the study aimed at assessing the cardio-structural abnormalities and coronary vascular changes faced with EMF patients using echocardiography, and coronary angiography with a detailed and thorough surgical examination of each case. RESULTS: Of the 55 operated patients, 1 had mild lesions, 26 had moderate lesions, and 28 had severe heart disease. All but one patient was in NYHA functional class III or IV at the time of surgery. All but one female patient with mild ventricular lesions and no valvular involvement had severe atrioventricular valve regurgitation with valves considered suitable for both replacements; 45 patients mean age 6.0 (±3.1) and repair nine patients mean age 3.8 (±2.9). The mean endocardial thickness was 3,000 (±1519) µm. CONCLUSIONS: The echocardiographic changes corresponded well to the findings on surgery and histopathology. The coronary changes seen included a spectrum of fibrin deposition, medial sclerosis and degeneration, and the formation of plexiform lesions. Surgically evaluating the resected cardiac tissue might help improve disease management.  "
Atrioventricular Valve Regurgitation in Single Ventricle Heart Disease: A Common Problem Associated With Progressive Deterioration and Mortality.  ;The Fontan procedure has provided patients with single ventricle physiology extended survival into adulthood and in many cases has improved their quality of life. Atrioventricular valve regurgitation (AVVR) is common in single ventricle patients and is associated with increased risk of mortality. AVVR is more common in patients with a systemic tricuspid or common atrioventricular valve but is generally progressive irrespective of underlying valve morphology. AVVR can be attributable to diverse structural and functional abnormalities at multiple levels of the valvar apparatus, as well as ventricular dysfunction and dilation. Multiple imaging modalities including recent advances in 3-dimensional echocardiography and cross-sectional imaging have been used to further understand AVVR. Surgery to address AVVR must be tailored to the underlying mechanism and the timing of surgical repair should be chosen carefully. In this review, we discuss the etiologies, treatment options, surgical timing, and outcomes of valve repair or replacement for AVVR in patients with single ventricle congenital heart disease, with a focus on those with a Fontan circulation as AVVR is associated with increased risk for Fontan failure and mortality. In-depth understanding of the current literature will help guide clinicians in their approach and management of AVVR in this population.

A hybrid echocardiography-CFD framework for ventricular flow simulations.  ;"Image-based CFD is a powerful tool to study cardiovascular flows while 2D echocardiography (echo) is the most widely used noninvasive imaging modality for the diagnosis of heart disease. Here, echo is combined with CFD, that is, an echo-CFD framework, to study ventricular flows. To achieve this, the previous 3D reconstruction from multiple 2D echo at standard cross sections is extended by: (a) reconstructing aortic and mitral valves from 2D echo and closing the left-ventricle (LV) geometry by approximating a superior wall; (b) incorporating the physiological assumption of the fixed apex as a reference (fixed) point in the 3D reconstruction; and (c) incorporating several smoothing algorithms to remove the nonphysical oscillations (ringing) near the basal section. The method is applied to echo from a baseline LV and one after inducing acute myocardial ischemia (AMI). The 3D reconstruction is validated by comparing it against a reference reconstruction from many echo sections while flow simulations are validated against the Doppler ultrasound velocity measurements. The sensitivity study shows that the choice of the smoothing algorithm does not change the flow pattern inside the LV. However, the presence of the mitral valve can significantly change the flow pattern during the diastole phase. In addition, the abnormal shape of a LV with AMI can drastically change the flow during diastole. Furthermore, the hemodynamic energy loss, as an indicator of the LV pumping performance, for different test cases is calculated, which shows a larger energy loss for a LV with AMI compared to the baseline one.

Ruptured sinus of valsalva presenting late following repair of tetralogy of fallot.  ;Rupture of sinus of valsalva following repair of tetralogy of fallot (TOF) is very rare. It should be suspected as a cause of recurrent or prolonged pleural effusion and congestive cardiac failure in patients who have undergone repair of TOF. We report one such patient.  
Clinical Significance of the Controlling Nutritional Status (CONUT) Score in Patients with Infective Endocarditis.  ;Risk stratification of patients with infective endocarditis (IE) is difficult. The Controlling Nutritional Status (CONUT) score is an index of immune function and nutritional status. We investigated the prognostic value of the CONUT score in IE and whether its prognostic value differed between IE patients with and without indications for surgery.Clinical records were retrospectively evaluated for 92 patients with IE treated at Nihon University Itabashi Hospital and Nihon University Hospital between January 2014 and May 2019. The CONUT score was determined upon admission, and patients were divided into two groups at the median score (≤ 7 [n = 50] and ≥ 8 [n = 42]). The primary outcome was all-cause mortality at 90 days after admission.The high CONUT group had significantly higher C-reactive protein and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide levels, as well as a significantly lower hemoglobin and estimated glomerular filtration rate (all P < 0.05), and considerably more valve perforation (26% versus 8%, P < 0.05). Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that mortality was significantly higher in the high CONUT group (P < 0.001). Even after adjusting for the propensity score based on IE risk factors, a higher CONUT score was still associated with mortality. A receiver-operating characteristic analysis revealed that a CONUT score ≥ 8 had a sensitivity of 86% and specificity of 76% for predicting all-cause mortality. A CONUT score ≥ 8 was most strongly associated with mortality in patients with surgical indications (P < 0.001).In patients with IE, a higher CONUT score was significantly associated with inflammation, heart failure, renal dysfunction, anemia, valve dysfunction, and short-term mortality, especially in patients with surgical indications.  
Evaluation of length of stay after transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation with SAPIEN 3 prosthesis: A French multicentre prospective observational trial.  ;BACKGROUND: Complications decrease after transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), and early discharge is feasible and safe in selected populations. AIMS: To evaluate length of stay (LOS) and reasons for prolonged hospitalisation after transfemoral TAVI in unselected patients. METHODS: Patients with severe aortic stenosis, who had transfemoral TAVI with the SAPIEN 3 prosthesis using exclusively local anaesthesia, were prospectively and consecutively included at five French high-volume centres. LOS was calculated from TAVI procedure to discharge. Reasons for prolonged hospitalisation (i.e.>3 days) were evaluated. RESULTS: Between 2017 and 2018, 293 patients were included, with a mean age of 82.4±6.5 years and a mean logistic EuroSCORE of 13.7±9.0%. The in-hospital mortality rate was 1.4%. The median LOS was 5 (3-7) days, and varied considerably between centres (from 2 to 7 days). Sixty-four (21.8%) patients were discharged within 3 days after transfemoral TAVI. Reported reasons for prolonged hospitalisation were complications in 62.2%, loss of autonomy in 3.1%, discharge refusal in 2.2% and logistical reasons in 0.9%. In 31.6% of cases, the investigators reported no apparent reasons. CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study suggest that LOS after transfemoral TAVI, using the SAPIEN 3 prosthesis and a minimalist approach, varies considerably between centres. In almost a third of cases, hospitalisation was prolonged without any apparent reason. Efforts should be made to educate centres to reduce LOS.  
Role of cilia in the pathogenesis of congenital heart disease.  ;An essential role for cilia in the pathogenesis of congenital heart disease (CHD) has emerged from findings of a large-scale mouse forward genetic screen. High throughput screening with fetal ultrasound imaging followed by whole exome sequencing analysis recovered a preponderance of cilia related genes and cilia transduced cell signaling genes among mutations identified to cause CHD. The perturbation of left-right patterning in CHD pathogenesis is suggested by the association of CHD with heterotaxy, but also by the finding of the co-occurrence of laterality defects with CHD in birth defect registries. Many of the cilia and cilia cell signaling genes recovered were found to be related to Hedgehog signaling. Studies in mice showed cilia transduced hedgehog signaling coordinates left-right patterning with heart looping and differentiation of the heart tube. Cilia transduced Shh signaling also regulates later events in heart development, including outflow tract septation and formation of the atrioventricular septum. More recent work has shown mutations in cilia related genes may also contribute to valve disease that largely manifest in adult life. Overall, these and other findings show cilia play an important role in CHD and also in more common valve diseases.  
Root abscess in the setting of infectious endocarditis: Short- and long-term outcomes.  ;"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the influence of an aortic root abscess on perioperative outcomes and long-term survival in patients with active infectious endocarditis that was treated surgically. METHODS: From 1996 to 2017, 336 consecutive patients were treated with aortic valve or root replacement for infective endocarditis, including patients with (n = 179) or without (n = 157) a root abscess. Data were obtained from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons data warehouse, through chart review, patient surveys, and National Death Index data. RESULTS: Demographic characteristics were similar between groups except the root abscess group had a significantly lower prevalence of congestive heart failure and higher rates of prosthetic valve endocarditis. The abscess group had significantly more aortic root replacements as well as longer cardiopulmonary bypass and crossclamp times. Operative mortality was 8.4% and 3.8% (P = .11) for the abscess and no abscess groups, respectively. Nevertheless, the root-abscess group had prolonged ventilation and longer intensive care unit stays. Kaplan-Meier survival was similar between root abscess and no abscess groups (10-year survival 41% vs 43%; P = .35). Significant risk factors for all-time mortality included age greater than 70 (hazard ratio [HR], 2.85; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.55, 5.24), the presence of a root abscess (HR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.02, 1.96), intravenous drug use (HR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.13, 2.89), congestive heart failure (HR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.22, 2.42), renal failure requiring dialysis (HR, 3.26; 95% CI, 2.30, 4.64), liver disease (HR, 3.04; 95% CI, 1.65, 5.60), and postoperative sepsis (HR, 3.00; 95% CI, 1.30, 6.93). The 10-year rate of reoperation was also similar between groups (5.9% vs 7.9%). CONCLUSIONS: Thorough and extensive debridement is critical for successful treatment of active endocarditis with root abscess. Bioprosthetic stented and stentless valves are valid conduits to treat endocarditis with root abscess.  "

Surgery for Bentall endocarditis: short- and midterm outcomes from a multicentre registry.  ;"OBJECTIVES: Endocarditis after the Bentall procedure is a severe disease often complicated by a pseudoaneurysm or mediastinitis. Reoperation is challenging but conservative therapy is not effective. The aim of this study was to assess short- and midterm outcomes of patients reoperated on for Bentall-related endocarditis. METHODS: Seventy-three patients with Bentall procedure-related endocarditis were recorded in the Italian registry. The mean age was 57 ± 14 years and 92% were men; preoperative comorbidities included hypertension (45%), diabetes (12%) and renal failure (11%). The logistic EuroSCORE was 25%; the EuroSCORE II was 8%. RESULTS: Preoperatively, 12% of the patients were in septic shock; left ventricular-aortic discontinuity was present in 63% and mitral valve involvement occurred in 12%. The most common pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus (22%) and Streptococci (14%). Reoperations after a median interval of 30 months (1-221 months) included a repeat Bentall with a bioconduit (41%), a composite mechanical (33%) or biological valved conduit (19%) and a homograft (6%). In 1 patient, a heart transplant was required (1%); in 12%, a mitral valve procedure was needed. The hospital mortality rate was 15%. The postoperative course was complicated by renal failure (19%), major bleeding (14%), pulmonary failure (14%), sepsis (11%) and multiorgan failure (8%). At multivariate analysis, urgent surgery was a risk factor for early death [hazard ratio 20.5 (1.9-219)]. Survival at 5 and 8 years was 75 ± 6% and 71 ± 7%, with 3 cases of endocarditis relapse. CONCLUSIONS: Surgery is effective in treating endocarditis following the Bentall procedure although it is associated with high perioperative mortality and morbidity rates. Endocarditis relapse seems to be uncommon.  "

A Cardiac Computed Tomography-Based Score to Categorize Mitral Annular Calcification Severity and Predict Valve Embolization.  ;"OBJECTIVES: This study aims to establish a computed tomography (CT)-based scoring system for grading mitral annular calcification (MAC) severity and potentially aid in predicting valve embolization during transcatheter mitral valve (MV) replacement using balloon-expandable aortic transcatheter heart valves. BACKGROUND: Transcatheter MV replacement is emerging as an alternative treatment for patients with severe MAC who are not surgical candidates. Although cardiac CT is the imaging modality of choice in the evaluation of candidates for valve-in-MAC (ViMAC), a standardized grading system to quantify MAC severity has not been established. METHODS: We performed a multicenter retrospective review of cardiac CT and clinical outcomes of patients undergoing ViMAC. A CT-based MAC score was created using the following features: average calcium thickness (mm), degrees of annulus circumference involved, calcification at one or both fibrous trigones, and calcification of one or both leaflets. Features were assigned points according to severity (total maximum score = 10) and severity grade was assigned based on total points (mild ≤3, moderate 4 to 6, and severe ≥7 points). The association between MAC score and device migration/embolization was evaluated. RESULTS: Of 117 patients in the TMVR in MAC registry, 87 had baseline cardiac CT of adequate quality. Of these, 15 were treated with transatrial access and were not included. The total cohort included 72 (trans-septal = 37, transapical = 35). Mean patient age was 74 ± 12 years, 66.7% were female, and the mean Society of Thoracic Surgery risk score was 15.4 ± 10.5%. The mean MAC score was 7.7 ± 1.4. Embolization/migration rates were lower in higher scores: Patients with a MAC score of 7 had valve embolization/migration rate of 12.5%, MAC score ≥8 had a rate of 8.7%, and a MAC score of ≥9 had zero (p = 0.023). Patients with a MAC score of ≤6 had 60% embolization/migration rate versus 9.7% in patients with a MAC score ≥7 (p < 0.001). In multivariable analysis, a MAC score ≤6 was in independent predictor of valve embolization/migration (odds ratio [OR]: 5.86 [95% CI: 1.00 to 34.26]; p = 0.049). CONCLUSIONS: This cardiac CT-based score provides a systematic method to grade MAC severity which may assist in predicting valve embolization/migration during trans-septal or transapical ViMAC procedures.

Sarcopenia and health-related quality of life in older adults after transcatheter aortic valve replacement.  ;"BACKGROUND: Skeletal muscle wasting, or sarcopenia, affects a significant proportion of patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). However, its influence on post-TAVR recovery and 1-year health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) remains unknown. We examined the relationship between skeletal muscle index (SMI), post-TAVR length of hospital stay (LOS), and 1-year QOL. METHODS: The study sample consisted of 300 consecutive patients undergoing TAVR from 2012 to 2018 who had pre-TAVR computed tomographic scans suitable for analysis of body composition. Skeletal muscle mass was quantified as cm2 of skeletal mass per m2 of body surface area from the cross-sectional computed tomographic image at the third lumbar vertebra. Sarcopenia was defined using established sex-specific cutoffs (women: SMI < 39 cm2/m2; men: < 55 cm2/m2). Multivariable linear regression analysis was used to determine the relationship between SMI, LOS, and HR-QOL using the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire. RESULTS: Sarcopenia was present in most (59%) patients and associated with older age (82 vs 76 years; P < .001) and lower body mass index (27 vs 33 kg/m2; P < .001). There were no other differences in baseline clinical or echocardiographic characteristics among the 4 quartiles of SMI. SMI was positively correlated with LOS and 1-year QOL. After adjusting for age, gender, race, and body mass index, SMI remained a significant predictor of both LOS (P = .01) and 1-year QOL (P = .012). For every 10 cm2/m2 higher SMI, there was an 8-point increase in Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire score, a difference that is clinically meaningful. CONCLUSIONS: Sarcopenia is prevalent in TAVR patients. Higher SMI is associated with shorter LOS and better 1-year HR-QOL. To achieve optimal TAVR benefits, further study into how body composition influences post-TAVR recovery and durable improvement in QOL is warranted.  "
Repeat transesophageal echocardiography in infective endocarditis: An analysis of contemporary utilization.  ;BACKGROUND: Current guidelines from the American Heart Association (AHA) recommend repeating transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) in three to five days if there is high suspicion of IE despite an initial TEE that was negative. This recommendation, however, is based on limited published data. OBJECTIVES: This investigation attempts to identify specific factors that prompted repeat TEE and evaluate the yield of IE-related findings demonstrated by repeat TEE as compared to initial or prior TEE. METHODS: A retrospective cohort who had at least one repeat TEE during an index hospitalization or initial course of antimicrobial therapy for IE between January 2014 and September 2018. We assessed the impact of repeat TEE on IE diagnosis and patient management and included a comparative analysis of patients with initial TEE only. RESULTS: Overall, 59 (44.7%) of 132 IE patients underwent repeat TEE. In a comparative analysis that involved patients who had undergone an initial TEE only versus those who had repeat TEE, male gender (P = .029) and presence of a prosthetic valve or annuloplasty ring (P = .017) were significantly associated with repeat TEE. Importantly, 8 (17.4%) of repeat TEE were critical for IE diagnosis, 8 (17.4%) impacted antimicrobial management, and 11 (23.9%) supported cardiovascular surgical intervention. CONCLUSIONS: From a population-based cohort of incident IE cases, repeat TEE was more frequently (44.7%) done in patients with suspect or proven IE and associated complications than anticipated. Repeat TEE remains pivotal in a contemporary practice that involves critical aspects of IE diagnosis and management.  
Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on interventional cardiology fellowship training in the New York metropolitan area: A perspective from the United States epicenter.  ;BACKGROUND: The healthcare burden posed by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in the New York Metropolitan area has necessitated the postponement of elective procedures resulting in a marked reduction in cardiac catheterization laboratory (CCL) volumes with a potential to impact interventional cardiology (IC) fellowship training. METHODS: We conducted a web-based survey sent electronically to 21 Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education accredited IC fellowship program directors (PDs) and their respective fellows. RESULTS: Fourteen programs (67%) responded to the survey and all acknowledged a significant decrease in CCL procedural volumes. More than half of the PDs reported part of their CCL being converted to inpatient units and IC fellows being redeployed to COVID-19 related duties. More than two-thirds of PDs believed that the COVID-19 pandemic would have a moderate (57%) or severe (14%) adverse impact on IC fellowship training, and 21% of the PDs expected their current fellows' average percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) volume to be below 250. Of 25 IC fellow respondents, 95% expressed concern that the pandemic would have a moderate (72%) or severe (24%) adverse impact on their fellowship training, and nearly one-fourth of fellows reported performing fewer than 250 PCIs as of March 1st. Finally, roughly one-third of PDs and IC fellows felt that there should be consideration of an extension of fellowship training or a period of early career mentorship after fellowship. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a significant reduction in CCL procedural volumes that is impacting IC fellowship training in the NY metropolitan area. These results should inform professional societies and accreditation bodies to offer tailored opportunities for remediation of affected trainees.  
A role for actin flexibility in thin filament-mediated contractile regulation and myopathy.  ;Striated muscle contraction is regulated by the translocation of troponin-tropomyosin strands over the thin filament surface. Relaxation relies partly on highly-favorable, conformation-dependent electrostatic contacts between actin and tropomyosin, which position tropomyosin such that it impedes actomyosin associations. Impaired relaxation and hypercontractile properties are hallmarks of various muscle disorders. The α-cardiac actin M305L hypertrophic cardiomyopathy-causing mutation lies near residues that help confine tropomyosin to an inhibitory position along thin filaments. Here, we investigate M305L actin in vivo, in vitro, and in silico to resolve emergent pathological properties and disease mechanisms. Our data suggest the mutation reduces actin flexibility and distorts the actin-tropomyosin electrostatic energy landscape that, in muscle, result in aberrant contractile inhibition and excessive force. Thus, actin flexibility may be required to establish and maintain interfacial contacts with tropomyosin as well as facilitate its movement over distinct actin surface features and is, therefore, likely necessary for proper regulation of contraction.  
Assessment of normal hemodynamic profile of mechanical pulmonary prosthesis by doppler echocardiography: a prospective cross-sectional study.  ;"OBJECTIVES: Very few reports have described the Doppler-derived echocardiographic parameters for mechanical pulmonary valve prosthesis (MPVP). This study aims to describe the normal Doppler hemodynamic profile of MPVP using Doppler echocardiography. METHODS: The current prospective, single center observational study enrolled 108 patients who underwent pulmonary valve replacement (PVR) surgery for the first time and had a normally functioning prosthesis post-operation. The hemodynamic performance of MPVPs, considering flow dependent and flow independent parameters, was evaluated at two follow-up points, at week one and week four post-operation. All assessments were conducted by an experienced echocardiographer. RESULTS: The mean age (±SD) of the participants was 26.4 (±8.98). Tetralogy of Fallot (ToF) was the most common underlying disease leading to PVR, with a prevalence of 88%. At first week post-operation, measurement of indices reported the following values (±SD): peak pressure gradient (PPG): 18.51(±7.64) mm Hg; mean pressure gradient (MPG): 10.88(±5.62) mm Hg; peak velocity (PV): 1.97(±0.43)m/s; doppler velocity index (DVI): 0.61(±18); pulmonary velocity acceleration time (PVAT): 87.35(±15.16) ms; effective orifice area (EOA): 2.98(±1.02) cm2;and effective orifice area to body surface area ratio (EOA/ BSA): 1.81(±0.62) cm2/m2. Comparing these measurements with those obtained from the second follow-up (at week four post-op) failed to hold significant difference in all values except for PVAT, which had increased from its primary value (p = 0.038). Also, right ventricular (RV) function showed significant improvement throughout the follow up period. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study help strengthen the previously scarce data pool and better establish the normal values for Doppler hemodynamics in mechanical pulmonary prosthesis.  "
"Pulmonary ductal coarctation and left pulmonary artery interruption; pathology and role of neural crest and second heart field during development.  ";OBJECTIVES: In congenital heart malformations with pulmonary stenosis to atresia an abnormal lateral ductus arteriosus to left pulmonary artery connection can lead to a localised narrowing (pulmonary ductal coarctation) or even interruption We investigated embryonic remodelling and pathogenesis of this area. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Normal development was studied in WntCre reporter mice (E10.0-12.5) for neural crest cells and Nkx2.5 immunostaining for second heart field cells. Data were compared to stage matched human embryos and a VEGF120/120 mutant mouse strain developing pulmonary atresia. RESULTS: Normal mouse and human embryos showed that the mid-pharyngeal endothelial plexus, connected side-ways to the 6th pharyngeal arch artery. The ventral segment formed the proximal pulmonary artery. The dorsal segment (future DA) was solely surrounded by neural crest cells. The ventral segment had a dual outer lining with neural crest and second heart field cells, while the distal pulmonary artery was covered by none of these cells. The asymmetric contribution of second heart field to the future pulmonary trunk on the left side of the aortic sac (so-called pulmonary push) was evident. The ventral segment became incorporated into the pulmonary trunk leading to a separate connection of the left and right pulmonary arteries. The VEGF120/120 embryos showed a stunted pulmonary push and a variety of vascular anomalies. SUMMARY: Side-way connection of the DA to the left pulmonary artery is a congenital anomaly. The primary problem is a stunted development of the pulmonary push leading to pulmonary stenosis/atresia and a subsequent lack of proper incorporation of the ventral segment into the aortic sac. Clinically, the aberrant smooth muscle tissue of the ductus arteriosus should be addressed to prohibit development of severe pulmonary ductal coarctation or even interruption of the left pulmonary artery.  
Semicarbazide-Sensitive Amine Oxidase Increases in Calcific Aortic Valve Stenosis and Contributes to Valvular Interstitial Cell Calcification.  ;INTRODUCTION: Calcific aortic valve stenosis (CAVS) is a common disease associated with aging. Oxidative stress participates in the valve calcification process in CAVS. Semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase (SSAO), also referred to as vascular adhesion protein 1 (VAP-1), transforms primary amines into aldehydes, generating hydrogen peroxide and ammonia. SSAO is expressed in calcified aortic valves, but its role in valve calcification has remained largely unexplored. The aims of this study were to characterize the expression and the activity of SSAO during aortic valve calcification and to establish the effects of SSAO inhibition on human valvular interstitial cell (VIC) calcification. METHODS: Human aortic valves from n = 80 patients were used for mRNA extraction and expression analysis, Western blot, SSAO activity determination, immunohistochemistry, and the isolation of primary VIC cultures. RESULTS: SSAO mRNA, protein, and activity were increased with increasing calcification within human aortic valves and localized in the vicinity of the calcified zones. The valvular SSAO upregulation was consistent after stratification of the subjects according to cardiovascular and CAVS risk factors associated with increased oxidative stress: body mass index, diabetes, and smoking. SSAO mRNA levels were significantly associated with poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) in calcified tissue. Calcification of VIC was inhibited in the presence of the specific SSAO inhibitor LJP1586. CONCLUSION: The association of SSAO expression and activity with valvular calcification and oxidative stress as well as the decreased VIC calcification by SSAO inhibition points to SSAO as a possible marker and therapeutic target to be further explored in CAVS.  
Differentiating Athlete's Heart from Left Ventricle Cardiomyopathies.  ;Imaging techniques have allowed knowing the structural adaptative changes observed in the hearts of highly trained athletes. Athletes can develop very marked structural changes and the need may rise for a differential diagnosis with real cardiomyopathy. In this chapter, authors review the physiologic and morphologic features associated with athletic training and the keys to differentiate normal adaptive athlete's heart from mild or initial expression forms of left-heart side cardiomyopathies such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), and left ventricle non-compaction (LVNC).  
State of the Art Management of Aortic Valve Disease in Ankylosing Spondylitis.  ;PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Cardiac involvement in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) generally manifests itself as aortic insufficiency, aortitis, disturbance in cardiac conduction, and myocardial dysfunction. We have used a case-based approach to review the current state of the art knowledge regarding the diagnosis and management of aortic valve disease and aortitis in patients with AS. RECENT FINDINGS: The risk for aortic valve disease and aortic valve replacement or repair is significantly higher than in people without AS, and this risk increases with age. Echocardiography, cardiac MRI, and CT can serve as effective tools for screening and follow-up. Surgical repair/replacement remains the mainstay of therapy for aortic insufficiency and aortic dilation, whereas transcatheter-based techniques may be favorable in the setting of aortic stenosis. Aortic valve and atrioventricular conduction abnormalities contribute to overall cardiovascular burden in AS. Optimal timing and therapeutic technique are dependent on assessment of overall risk and serial follow-up.

German Heart Surgery Report 2019: The Annual Updated Registry of the German Society for Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery.  ;Based on a longtime voluntary registry, founded by the German Society for Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (GSTCVS) in 1980, well-defined data of all cardiac, thoracic, and vascular surgery procedures performed in 78 German heart surgery departments during the year 2019 are analyzed. For this period, a total of 175,705 procedures were submitted to the registry, 100,446 summarized as heart surgery procedures in a classical sense. The unadjusted in-hospital survival rate for the 34,224 isolated coronary artery bypass grafting procedures (relationship on-/off-pump 3.8:1) was 97.3%. For the 36,650 isolated heart valve procedures (16,625 transcatheter interventions included), it was 96.4%. Concerning short- and long-term circulatory support, a total of 2,716 extracorporeal life support/extracorporeal membrane oxygenation implantations, resp. 953 assist device implantations (L-/ R-/ BVAD, TAH) were registered. In 2019, the number of isolated heart transplantations increased to 333, a rise of 6.7% compared to the previous year. The isolated lung transplantations amounted to 311, a decrease of 8.5%. This annually updated registry of the GSTCVS represents voluntary public reporting by accumulating actual information for nearly all heart surgical procedures in Germany, constitutes advancements in heart medicine, and represents a basis for quality management for all participating institutions. In addition, the registry demonstrates that the provision of cardiac surgery in Germany is up to date, appropriate, and nationwide patient treatment is guaranteed all the time.  
Unilateral diaphragmatic paralysis associated with surgical mitral valve repair in dogs.  ;OBJECTIVES: Unilateral diaphragmatic paralysis (UDP) due to phrenic nerve injury is a potential complication of thoracic surgery. This study evaluated the prevalence of UDP associated with surgical mitral valve repair (MVR) and its effect on surgical outcomes in dogs. ANIMALS, MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two hundred ninety-four dogs that underwent MVR were included in the study. A retrospective review of medical records was performed for dogs surviving surgery. Diagnosis of UDP was based on preoperative and postoperative thoracic dorsoventral radiographs. RESULTS: A total of 284 dogs survived until the day after surgery. The prevalence of UDP on the day after surgery, on the day of discharge, and after the first postoperative month was 30%, 24%, and 9%, respectively. One case of UDP was observed at 3 months after surgery. Unilateral diaphragmatic paralysis was exhibited by nine of the 21 patients that died in the hospital. The proportion of patients with UDP was higher in dogs that died of respiratory failure than in dogs that died of other causes (p = 0.002). Most dogs whose deaths were suspected to have been related to respiratory failure also had pre-existing respiratory diseases. The occurrence of UDP did not relate to the lengths of stay in the intensive care unit or the hospital. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that UDP is a common complication in dogs after MVR and that the prevalence of UDP decreases with time after surgery. Unilateral diaphragmatic paralysis is a risk factor for postoperative death, especially in patients with pre-existing respiratory disease.  
Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in Aortic Regurgitation.  ;"BACKGROUND: Evidence about safety and efficacy of transcatheter aortic valve replacement remains limited for patients with aortic regurgitation. METHODS: From the Safety and Efficacy of the J-Valve Ausper System in Patients with Severe Aortic Stenosis and/or Aortic Regurgitation Registry, the clinical outcomes of patients with aortic regurgitation from West China Hospital were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 134 patients with The Society of Thoracic Surgeons mean risk score of 9.8% underwent transcatheter aortic valve replacement with the J-Valve. Of those, 5 patients (3.7%) were converted to surgical aortic valve replacement. The cumulative all-cause mortality was 3% at 30 days and 3.7% at 6 months. One major bleeding (0.7%), 1 major vascular complication (0.7%), 8 acute kidney diseases (6%), 12 third-degree atrioventricular block (9%), and 1 paravalvular leakage (0.7%) moderate or greater occurred. The device success rate was 96.3%. Mean ejection fraction improved from 52.1% to 57.1% (P < .001) at 30 days and to 58.7% (P < .001 compared with baseline) at 6 months. Mean estimated pulmonary arterial pressure decreased from 29.3 to 23.1 mm Hg (P < .001) at 30 days and to 21.5 mm Hg (P < .001 compared with the baseline) at 6 months. On multivariable analysis, New York Heart Association functional class at 6 months (odds ratio 8.87; 95% confidence interval, 1.36 to 58.06) was independently associated with all-cause mortality at 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement with the J-Valve proved to have acceptable early and midterm clinical outcomes for patients with aortic regurgitation. This is a large-scale single-center study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of transcatheter aortic valve replacement in treating aortic regurgitation.  "
Relative Costs of Surgical and Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement and Medical Therapy.  ;"BACKGROUND: The number of patients treated for aortic valve disease in the United States is increasing rapidly. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is supplanting surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) and medical therapy (MT). The economic implications of these trends are unknown. Therefore, we undertook to determine the costs, inpatient days, and number of admissions associated with treating aortic valve disease with SAVR, TAVR, or MT. METHODS: Using the Nationwide Readmissions Database, we identified patients with aortic valve disease admitted 2012 to 2016 for SAVR, TAVR, and disease symptoms (congestive heart failure, unstable angina, non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, syncope). Patients not undergoing SAVR or TAVR were classified as receiving MT. Beginning with the index admission, we estimated inpatient costs, days, and admissions over 6 months. RESULTS: Among 190 563 patients with aortic valve disease, the average aggregate 6-month inpatient costs were $59 743 for SAVR, $64 395 for TAVR, and $23 460 for MT. Mean index admission was longer for SAVR (10.0 days) than for TAVR (7.0 day) or MT (5.3 days), but the average number of unplanned readmission inpatient days was 2.0 for SAVR, 3.0 for TAVR, and 4.3 for MT; the average number of total admissions was 1.3 for SAVR, 1.5 for TAVR, and 1.7 for MT (P<0.01 for all). TAVR index admission costs decreased over time to become similar to SAVR costs by 2016. CONCLUSIONS: Aggregate costs were higher for TAVR than SAVR and were significantly more expensive than MT alone. However, TAVR costs decreased over time while SAVR and MT costs remained unchanged.  "
Sex differences in cardiac magnetic resonance features in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  ;Whether sex differences exist in cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) findings in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) remain unknown. We sought to assess and compare CMR characteristics in male and female patients with HCM. From January-2006 to October-2017, 165 consecutive HCM patients evaluated with CMR were included. All clinical and complementary test information was prospectively collected. At the time of CMR evaluation women were older (70 [57-75] vs. 61 [47-72] years, p = 0.02) and more symptomatic in terms of dyspnea (New York Heart Association class II-IV 47.2 vs. 24.1%, p = 0.003) and palpitations (19.6 vs. 4.6%, p = 0.006) and received more frequently treatment with diuretics (49.1% vs. 23.4%, p = 0.001). On echocardiographic examination more women had obstructive physiology (45.1 vs. 20.6%, p = 0.002). On CMR evaluation, women showed smaller left ventricular end-systolic volume index (13 [10-15] vs. 16 [13-21] ml/m2, p < 0.001), higher left ventricular ejection fraction (77 [74-80] vs. 72 [66-78]%, p = 0.004), more marked left ventricular outflow tract acceleration (54.7 vs. 26.4%, p < 0.001) and mitral regurgitation (33.3 vs. 12.7%, p = 0.002). In multivariable analysis, female sex [OR 2.44 (1.04-5.73), p = 0.04] and left ventricular end-systolic volume index [OR 1.60 (1.08-2.38), p = 0.018] were independently associated with obstructive physiology. Women with HCM have more frequently obstructive physiology, a finding that could be related to the smaller left ventricular end-systolic volume.  
Three-Dimensional Echocardiography　- Role in Clinical Practice and Future Directions.  ;"Echocardiography has become an extension of the physical examination in cardiovascular practice. Frequently, it is used to confirm a clinical diagnostic suspicion. Another important role is to detect the underlying cardiovascular lesion to explain a patient's symptom complex or an abnormality found on chest radiography, electrocardiography, or cardiac enzyme tests. Patients are referred to the echocardiography laboratory because of their symptoms or due to non-specific laboratory abnormalities, and echocardiographers are expected to provide a definite diagnosis or a therapeutic clue. The introduction of the matrix array transducer into clinical practice allowed the acquisition of three-dimensional (3D) datasets. 3D echocardiography (3DE) has many advantages over 2-dimensional echocardiography, such as: (1) improved visualization of the complex shapes and spatial relations between cardiac structures; (2) improved quantification of the cardiac volumes and function; and (3) improved display and assessment of valve dysfunction. 3DE is increasingly utilized during routine clinical practice. This review article is aimed to examine the current clinical utility and future directions of 3DE.  "
Direct measurement of atrioventricular valve regurgitant jets using 4D flow cardiovascular magnetic resonance is accurate and reliable for children with congenital heart disease: a retrospective cohort study.  ;"BACKGROUND: 3D-time resolved flow (4DF) cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) with retrospective analysis of atrioventricular valve regurgitation (AVVR) allows for internal validation by multiple direct and indirect methods. Limited data exist on direct measurement of AVVR by 4DF CMR in pediatric congenital heart disease (CHD). We aimed to validate direct measurement of the AVVR jet as accurate and reliable compared to the volumetric method (clinical standard by 2D CMR) and as a superior method of internal validation than the annular inflow method. METHODS: We identified 44 consecutive patients with diverse CHD referred for evaluation of AVVR by CMR. 1.5 T or 3 T scanners, intravenous contrast, and a combination of parallel imaging and compressed sensing were used. Four methods of measuring AVVR volume (RVol) were used: volumetric method (VOL; the clinical standard) = stroke volume by 2D balanced steady-state free precession - semilunar valve forward flow (SLFF); annular inflow method (AIM) = atrioventricular valve forward flow [AVFF] - semilunar valve net flow (SLNF); and direct measurement (JET). AVFF was measured using static and retrospective valve tracking planes. SLFF, SLNF, AVFF, and JET were measured by 4DF phase contrast. Regurgitant fraction was calculated as [RVol/(RVol+SLNF)]× 100. Statistical methods included Spearman, Wilcoxon rank sum test/Student paired t-test, Bland Altman analysis, and intra-class coefficient (ICC), where appropriate. RESULTS: Regurgitant fraction by JET strongly correlated with the indirect methods (VOL and AIM) (ρ = 0.73-0.80, p < 0.001) and was similar to VOL with a median difference (interquartile range) of - 1.5% (- 8.3-7.2%; p = 0.624). VOL had weaker correlations with AIM and JET (ρ = 0.69-0.73, p < 0.001). AIM underestimated RF by 3.6-6.9% compared to VOL and JET, p < 0.03. Intra- and inter- observer reliability were excellent for all methods (ICC 0.94-0.99). The mean (±standard deviation) inter-observer difference for VOL was 2.4% (±5.1%), p < 0.05. CONCLUSIONS: In a diverse cohort of pediatric CHD, measurement of AVVR using JET is accurate and reliable to VOL and is a superior method of internal validation compared to AIM. This study supports use of 4DF CMR for measurement of AVVR, obviating need for expert prospective prescription during image acquisition by 2D CMR.  "
Subacute pericardial abscess after aortic valve replacement: a case report.  ;BACKGROUND: Purulent pericarditis is an infectious disease, frequently caused by gram-positive bacteria, that is rarely observed in healthy individuals, and is often associated with predisposing conditions. CASE PRESENTATION: Here, we present the case of an Escherichia coli post-surgical localized purulent pericarditis complicated by transient constrictive pericarditis and its diagnostic and therapeutic management. CONCLUSIONS: Our case report focuses on the importance of imaging-guided treatment of purulent pericardial diseases, in particular on the emerging role of 18 F-labelled 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography in pericardial diseases and on the management of transient constrictive pericarditis, often seen after thoracic surgery.  
Impact of type 2 diabetes mellitus on mid-term mortality for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients who underwent septal myectomy.  ;BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes mellitus is common in cardiovascular disease. It is associated with adverse clinical outcomes for patients who had undergone coronary artery bypass and valve operations. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of type 2 diabetes mellitus on the midterm outcomes of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy who underwent septal myectomy. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the data of 67 hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who underwent septal myectomy from two medical centers in China from 2011 to 2018. A propensity score-matched cohort of 134 patients without type 2 diabetes mellitus was also analyzed. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 28.0 (interquartile range: 13.0-3.0) months, 9 patients died. The cause of death of all of these patients was cardiovascular, particularly sudden cardiac death in 3 patients. Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus had a higher rate of sudden cardiac death (4.5% vs. 0.0%, p = 0.04). The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that the rates of predicted 3-year survival free from cardiovascular death (98.1% vs. 95.1%, p = 0.14) were similar between the two groups. However, the rates of predicted 3-year survival free from sudden cardiac death (100% vs. 96.7%, p = 0.01) were significantly higher in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients without type 2 diabetes mellitus than in those with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Furthermore, after adjustment for age and sex, only N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (hazards ratio: 1.002, 95% confidence interval: 1.000-1.005, p = 0.02) and glomerular filtration rate ≤ 80 ml/min (hazards ratio: 3.23, 95% confidence interval: 1.34-7.24, p = 0.047) were independent risk factors for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. CONCLUSIONS: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus have similar 3-year cardiovascular mortality after septal myectomy. However, type 2 diabetes mellitus is associated with higher sudden cardiac death rate in these patients. In addition, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide and glomerular filtration rate ≤ 80 ml/min were independent risk factors among hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.  
Cardiac operation under cardiopulmonary bypass during pregnancy.  ;BACKGROUND: Certain pregnant women suffer from cardiac pathology,and a few of them need cardiac operations under cardiopulmonary bypass during pregnancy. Feto-neonatal and maternal outcomes have not been sufficiently described. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of 22 cases of women undergoing cardiac operations under cardiopulmonary bypass during pregnancy in our hospital from Jan.2014 to Mar.2019. RESULTS: All 22 patients were alive after treatment. The types of cardiac disorders included congenital heart defects, rheumatic heart disease,infective endocarditis,aortic dissection, obstruction and/or thrombosis of a prosthetic valve. Only one case was a twin pregnancy,and the other 21 cases were singletons. Four fetuses died in the utero after surgery. Three patients chose termination of the pregnancy after the cardiac operations: one fetus was detected abnormity of the brain and the other two patients abandoned pregnancy. Fourteen fetuses were alive and born without any abnormity. Two fetuses suffered from neonatal intracranial hemorrhage and died after birth. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac operation under cardiopulmonary bypass during pregnancy is a challenge for physicians in multidisciplinary teams. Strictly evaluating the indication is vital. On the other hand, some patients can benefit from this management.  
Modified unicaval drainage in reoperative isolated tricuspid valve repair via totally thoracoscopic approach.  ;AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility, safety, and clinical effect of modified unicaval drainage for thoracoscopic reoperative isolated tricuspid valve repair, compared with conventional bicaval drainage. METHODS: A total of 45 consecutive cases of patients who underwent thoracoscopic reoperative isolated tricuspid valve repair on beating-heart were enrolled and divided into two groups according to the different venous drainage (Group A: modified unicaval drainage, Group B: conventional bicaval drainage). A retrospective analysis of perioperative data and clinical outcomes were performed and all the surviving cases were followed up. Re-evaluation of echocardiography and electrocardiogram was performed prior to discharge, and at first month, sixth month, and every year follow-up. RESULTS: The overall postoperative 30-day mortality was 4.5% in Group A and 8.7% in Group B. The postoperative tricuspid valve regurgitation grade of both groups decreased significantly from preoperative regurgitation grade, p < 0.001, without intergroup significant difference, p = 0.815. Follow-up duration ranged from 6 to 38 months, there was one death at 24 months in Group A, and another at 9 months in Group B, respectively. Nobody from both groups experienced reintervention for residual tricuspid regurgitation. No significant difference could be identified about the incidence of postoperative morbidities and follow-up adverse events. CONCLUSION: Both strategies of caval venous drainage can provide satisfactory exposure for thoracoscopic reoperative isolated tricuspid valve repair and equivalent favorable postoperative outcome. And the modified unicaval drainage group may even preserve the anesthetic time and decrease the risk of iatrogenic jugular injury, achieving a more simplified procedure with better cosmetic outcome.  
Impact of Frailty on Mortality, Readmissions, and Resource Utilization After TAVI.  ;With aging population and preponderance of severe aortic stenosis occurring in elderly patients, the number of transcatheter aortic valve implantations (TAVI) performed in the elderly are growing. Frailty is common in the elderly and is known to be associated with worse outcomes. We aimed to evaluate the impact of frailty on hospital readmissions rates after TAVI. We used the 2016 Nationwide Readmission Database and categorized patients who underwent TAVI low, intermediate, and high frailty status. The primary outcome was 6-months readmission rates across the 3 frailty categories. Secondary outcomes included causes of readmissions, in-hospital mortality and cost of care. STATA 16.0 was used for survey-specific statistical tests. Of 20,504 patients who underwent TAVI, 58.9% were low-, 39.6% were intermediate-, and 1.5% were in the high-frailty group. Overall in-hospital mortality was 1.9% (n = 396), and was 0.6%, 3.3%, and 16.8% (p <0.01) with increasing frailty. Of the 20,108 patients who survived to discharge, 6,427 (32%) patients were readmitted within 6-months after TAVI. Readmission rates increased across the categories from 27.9% in low, 37.6% in intermediate and 51.1% in high frailty group (p <0.01). While cardiac causes (mostly heart failure) were the predominant readmission etiologies across frailty categories (low: 51.2%, intermediate: 34.1%, high: 27.2%), rates of infectious and injury-related readmissions increased (low: 11%, intermediate: 30%, high: 45%). Mortality during readmissions also worsened from 0.8%, 5.3%, and 8.5% (p <0.01). Over 40% of patients undergoing TAVI were of intermediate-high frailty. In conclusion, an increasing frailty was associated with significantly worse postprocedure mortality, readmissions, and related mortality.  
Meta-Analysis of Prevalence and Risk Factors for Cognitive Decline and Improvement After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.  ;"Changes to cognition, both decline and improvement, are commonly reported after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). However, previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses have missed these subgroups by assessing whole-group-averages for cognitive outcomes. We sought to pool estimates to identify the prevalence of cognitive decline and improvement after TAVI, as well as associated factors for these outcomes. A systematic review identified 15 articles appropriate for meta-analysis. When robust cognitive change definitions were employed, the pooled prevalence of incident cognitive impairment up to 1-, 1 to 6-, and ≥6-months post-TAVI was 7%, 14%, and 12%, respectively. For cognitive improvement, the prevalence from 1 to 6 months and ≥6 months after TAVI was estimated to be 19% and 11%, respectively. Two factors were associated with these cognitive outcomes: (1) using a cerebral embolic protection device was associated with decreased prevalence of cognitive decline up to 1-week post-TAVI; (2) baseline cognitive impairment had a large association with post-TAVI cognitive improvement. In conclusion, cognitive decline and cognitive improvement are experienced by approximately 7% to 19% of patients after TAVI, respectively. Those with the lowest cognitive performance pre-TAVI appear to have the most to gain in terms of cognitive improvement post-TAVI. Identifying further predictive factors for cognitive decline and improvement post-TAVI will facilitate a personalized-medicine approach for cognitive care and prognosis.  "
Comparison of Outcomes of Alcohol Septal Ablation or Septal Myectomy for Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy in Patients ≤65 Years Versus >65 Years.  ;"Alcohol septal ablation (ASA) and septal myectomy (SM) are therapeutic interventions for patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HC) who remain symptomatic despite medical treatment. Outcomes for both interventions in age groups ≤65 versus >65 years are scarce. We queried the National Readmission Database for adult patients undergoing either SM or ASA between 2010 and 2015 for HC. Patients were divided into 2 age-groups (≤65-years and >65-years). We aimed to compare the in-hospital mortality, complication rates, and resource utilization for each procedure between the 2 age-groups. We identified 4,358 patients with HC who underwent intervention, of which 2,113 were treated with SM and 2,245 with ASA. In-hospital mortality was 6-times higher in patients ≤65 years old who underwent SM compared with ASA (1.5% vs 0.3% odds ratio 6.2; p = 0.04); and 4-times higher in patients >65 years treated with SM compared with ASA (6.7% vs 1.7% odds ratio 4.29; p = 0.04). Blood transfusion rates and stroke were higher in patients undergoing SM, regardless of their age-group. Length of hospital stay was lower in the ASA group (3 days vs 6 days for both age groups, p <0.001) as well as median hospital costs (≤65 years old: $15,474 vs $31.531; and >65 years old: $16,672 vs $36,042, p <0.001). In conclusion, patients with HC treated with ASA had significantly lower in-hospital mortality, complications rates, length of hospital stay, and hospital costs compared with patients undergoing SM at any age.

Direct right ventricular Impella LD implantation enables postoperative ambulation and may avoid sternal re-entry.  ;Right ventricular assist devices (RVADs) typically require groin cannulation or sternal re-entry which can be avoided by direct pulmonary artery implantation with an Impella. We report the first use of the Impella LD as a directly implanted RVAD.  
Two Cases of Cardiac Implantable Electronic Device Placement via Persistent Left Superior Vena Cava.  ;"Persistent left superior vena cava (PLSVC) is the most common variation of anomalous venous return to the heart and present in 0.1-0.5% of the general population. The left anterior cardinal veins typically obliterate during early cardiac development but failure of involution results in PLSVC. It is an asymptomatic congenital anomaly, usually discovered while performing interventions through the left subclavian vein or during cardiovascular imaging. PLSVC can be associated with cardiac arrhythmias and congenital heart disease. We present two cases of PLSVC: first, a 68-year-old male who presented with complete heart block, for which a temporary pacemaker was initially inserted followed by a permanent pacemaker; second, a 53-year-old female with a history of hypertension and ischemic cardiomyopathy with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 25%, and a survivor of sudden cardiac death, who underwent an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) for secondary prevention. Both cases of PLSVC were detected incidentally during the transvenous approach to the heart. PLSVC was suspected by the unusually left medial position of the lead, while cineflouroscopy showed the venous trajectory toward the coronary sinus and drainage into the right atrium. It is technically difficult to cross the wire through the tricuspid valve when coming from the PLSVC and coronary sinus without making a loop in the right atrium, which is known as a wide loop technique. PLSVC is an uncommon anomalous anatomical variant and should be recognized appropriately by specialists who frequently carry out procedures through the left subclavian vein, such as implantation of permanent pacemaker, ICD and cardiac resynchronization therapy. It should also be recognized that wide loop formation of the right ventricular lead in the right atrium is helpful to cross the tricuspid valve and to affix the lead in the right ventricle. LEARNING POINTS: Persistent left superior vena cava is an anatomical variant that should be recognized by specialists who frequently carry procedures through the left subclavian vein (e.g. implantation of a permanent pacemaker, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator and cardiac resynchronization therapy).Maneuvers like wide loop formation of the right ventricular lead in the right atrium is helpful to cross the tricuspid valve and to affix the lead in the right ventricle.The cardiac imaging specialist should also suspect and rule out PLSVC on encountering a dilated coronary sinus on any imaging modality.

Specialist valve clinic in a cardiac centre: 10-year experience.  ;AIMS: Guidelines recommend specialist valve clinics as best practice for the assessment and conservative management of patients with heart valve disease. However, there is little guidance on how to set up and organise a clinic. The aim of this study is to describe a clinic run by a multidisciplinary team consisting of cardiologists, physiologist/scientists and a nurse. METHODS: The clinical and organisational aims of the clinic, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and links with other services are described. The methods of training non-clinical staff are detailed. Data were prospectively entered onto a database and the study consisted of an analysis of the clinical characteristics and outcomes of all patients seen between 1 January 2009 and 31 December 2018. RESULTS: There were 2126 new patients and 9522 visits in the 10-year period. The mean age was 64.8 and 55% were male. Of the visits, 3587 (38%) were to the cardiologists, 4092 (43%) to the physiologist/scientists and 1843 (19%) to the nurse. The outcomes from the cardiologist clinics were cardiology follow-up in 460 (30%), referral for surgery in 354 (23%), referral to the physiologist/scientist clinic in 412 (27%) or to the nurse clinic in 65 (4.3%) and discharge in 230 (15%). The cardiologist needed to see 6% from the nurse clinic and 10% from the physiologist/scientist clinic, while advice alone was sufficient in 10% and 9%. CONCLUSION: A multidisciplinary specialist valve clinic is feasible and sustainable in the long term.  
Recent clinical trials in valvular heart diseases.  ;PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In recent years, no other field of cardiology has experienced a greater influx of transformational therapeutic options as valvular heart disease. The present review discusses the landmark trials published in the last 18 months that have shaped the modern day management of valvular heart diseases. RECENT FINDINGS: There have been several landmark trials in recent years, which have expanded the indications for transcatheter aortic valve replacement to low-risk surgical patients and the use of MitraClip for patients with functional mitral regurgitation. Options for transcatheter management of right-sided valvular disease also continue to evolve, including promising results from early feasibility studies. SUMMARY: The development of novel transcatheter therapies for valvular heart disease has expanded the armamentarium of physicians treating patients with valvular heart disease. The present review will focus on the recent (within 2 years) trials in this field of interest.  
[Cardiac Surgery for Mitral Regurgitation Associated with Essential Thrombocythemia].  ;An 80-year-old woman with essential thrombocythemia was diagnosed with severe mitral regurgitation and moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Preoperatively, she had been treated with hydroxycarbamide and low-dose aspirin since her platelet count was high( 96.2×104/μl). After the platelet count was reduced to 46.2×104/μl, she underwent mitral valve repair and tricuspid valve annuloplasty. Atypical heparin resistance was noted intraoperatively. After initial heparin infusion, the activated clotting time(ACT) increased as expected. However, it decreased after initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass, despite additional heparin infusion and heparin concentration maintenance. A correlation between platelet factor 4 and heparin resistance was suggested. On discharge, she had no complications. We should consider the possibility of heparin resistance in essential thrombocythemia even when platelet count is adequately controlled.  
A case of giant main pulmonary artery aneurysm associated with complicated congenital heart disease and simultaneous chronic pulmonary artery dissection.  ;BACKGROUND: Pulmonary artery aneurysm (PAA), usually associated with congenital heart disease (CHD), is a very rare clinical condition. Pulmonary artery dissection (PAD) is considered the most life-threatening complication of PAA, and patients can progress from being asymptomatic to sudden death. We report the following case of PAA associated with complicated congenital heart disease and simultaneous chronic PAD. To our knowledge, few such complicated cases have ever been reported. CASE PRESENTATION: A 36-year-old male presented to our hospital with a 10-year history of heart fatigue after activities and aggravated for 2 years. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) and echocardiogram showed a giant main pulmonary artery aneurysm (14 cm) with complicated congenital heart disease (a small patent ductus arteriosus, ventricular septal defects, aortic coarctation). Chronic PAD, which was mistaken for a pulmonary valve before operation, was detected during surgery. CONCLUSIONS: PAA associated with complicated CHD and simultaneous PAD is very rare, and its clinical symptoms are varied. Radiologists and surgeons should pay attention to determining whether this patient simultaneously had PAD when PAA was detected on preoperative CTA imaging.  
Quality of life in sexagenarians after aortic biological vs mechanical valve replacement: a single-center study in China.  ;"Erratum in J Cardiothorac Surg. 2020 Aug 3;15(1):208.  "
FADS1 (Fatty Acid Desaturase 1) Genotype Associates With Aortic Valve FADS mRNA Expression, Fatty Acid Content and Calcification.  ;"BACKGROUND: Aortic stenosis (AS) contributes to cardiovascular mortality and morbidity but disease mechanisms remain largely unknown. Recent evidence associates a single nucleotide polymorphism rs174547 within the FADS1 gene, encoding FADS1 (fatty acid desaturase 1), with risk of several cardiovascular outcomes, including AS. FADS1 encodes a rate-limiting enzyme for ω-3 and ω-6 fatty acid metabolism. The aim of this study was to decipher the local transcriptomic and lipidomic consequences of rs174547 in tricuspid aortic valves from patients with AS. METHODS: Expression quantitative trait loci study was performed using data from Illumina Human610-Quad BeadChip, Infinium Global Screening Arrays, and Affymetrix Human Transcriptome 2.0 arrays in calcified and noncalcified aortic valve tissue from 58 patients with AS (mean age, 74.2; SD, 5.9). Fatty acid content was assessed in aortic valves from 25 patients with AS using gas chromatography. Δ5 and Δ6 desaturase activity was assessed by the product-to-precursor ratio. RESULTS: The minor C-allele of rs174547, corresponding to the protective genotype for AS, was associated with higher FADS2 mRNA levels in calcified valve tissue, whereas FADS1 mRNA and other transcripts in proximity of the single nucleotide polymorphism were unaltered. In contrast, the FADS1 Δ5-desaturase activity and the FADS2 Δ6-desaturase activity were decreased. Finally, docosahexaenoic acid was decreased in calcified tissue compared with non-calcified tissue and C-allele carriers exhibited increased docosahexaenoic acid levels. Overall desaturase activity measured with ω-3 fatty acids was higher in C-allele carriers. CONCLUSIONS: The association between the FADS1 genotype and AS may implicate effects on valvular fatty acids.  "
Validation and preliminary data from a health-related quality of life questionnaire for owners of dogs with cardiac disease.  ;"BACKGROUND: Cardiac disease in dogs impacts the quality of life (QoL) of their owners, but owners' QoL has not been comprehensively assessed in this population. OBJECTIVES: To develop, validate, and provide preliminary data from a health-related QoL (hrQoL) questionnaire for owners of dogs with cardiac disease. SUBJECTS: A total of 141 owners of dogs with cardiac disease were studied. METHODS: An owner hrQoL (O-hrQoL) questionnaire containing 20 items related to areas of a person's life that could be impacted by caring for a dog with cardiac disease was developed and administered to owners of dogs with cardiac disease. The highest possible total score was 100, with higher scores indicating a worse hrQoL. Readability, internal consistency, face and construct validity, and item-total correlations were assessed. RESULTS: Median O-hrQoL score was 35 (range, 0-87). The questionnaire had good internal consistency (Cronbach's α = 0.933), construct validity (Spearman's r = 0.38-0.53; Kendall's τ = 0.30-0.43; P < .001), and item-total correlation (Spearman's r = 0.44-0.79; Kendall's τ = 0.34-0.66; all P < .001). Fifty percent of owners indicated a negative effect of dogs' cardiac disease on their own QoL, but all owners responded that caring for their dogs either had strengthened (n = 76; 53.9%) or had no effect on their relationship with their dog (n = 65; 46.1%). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: The O-hrQoL questionnaire had good validity, and results suggest that owners' QoL is significantly impacted by caring for dogs with cardiac disease. Additional research on effective approaches to minimizing the negative effects of a dog's cardiac disease on the owner is warranted.  "
New developments in transcatheter therapy of mitral valve disease.  ;Mitral valve regurgitation (MR) belongs to one of the most common acquired valve diseases in western countries with increasing prevalence in older age. For patients with high perioperative risk and older age prohibitive for valve surgery, the development of transcatheter mitral valve therapies offers new options. Assessment of the severity and etiology of MR and thorough imaging of the mitral valve anatomy and pathology are necessary prerequisites for appropriate decision making in the field of transcatheter mitral valve therapies. Different transcatheter repair and replacement techniques are on the market, most of them mimicking surgical techniques. With some techniques (e.g., the MitraClip device), there is good clinical experience (>80,000 devices implanted worldwide), and evidence (three randomized studies), whereas for newer procedures, safety and efficacy data are still very limited. Transcatheter mitral repair and replacement techniques have to be considered as complementary treatment options for high-risk patients indicated by the Heart Teams. The different techniques and devices will be introduced and discussed in the following paper.  
Aortic and mitral valve surgery for infective endocarditis with reconstruction of the intervalvular fibrous body: an analysis of clinical outcomes.  ;BACKGROUND: Reconstruction of the aorto-mitral curtain (AMC) for invasive double-valve infective endocarditis (IE) is a rare and challenging procedure. This study presents the short- and mid-term results of reconstruction of AMC in a single center. METHODS: From 2016 to 2019, 14 patients with invasive double-valve underwent surgical reconstruction of the AMC, along with either double valve replacement or aortic valve replacement with mitral valve repair. Two patients were diagnosed as Behcet's disease. Bicuspid aortic valve was detected in six patients. Mean follow up was 18.9±12.2 months. RESULTS: Positive blood culture was found in 10 (71.4%) patients: 3 of Abiotrophia defective (21.4%). The mean cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) time was 154.5±25.9 minutes and the mean cross-clamp time was 116.8±18.2 minutes. One patient died of multiple organ failure (7.1%) 60 days after surgery. There was 1 (7.1%) case of stroke, 1 (7.1%) of atrioventricular block with pacemaker implantation, 1 (7.1%) of reoperation for bleeding. There was no late death during follow-up. The survival at 3 years was 92.9%. Freedom from reoperation at 1, 2, and 3 years was 100%, 100%, and 100% during follow-up, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The double-valve replacement and AMC reconstruction (the Commando procedure) is an effective technique in complex heart valve disease. The short- and mid-term results with this technique are optimal, with a very low in-hospital mortality and nearly 100% of long-term survival during follow-up.  
The Relation between Volume and Outcome of Transcatheter and Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.  ;Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) are standard procedures for dealing with severe aortic stenosis patients. Researchers have not carried out a systematic review of the volume-outcome relationship in TAVR and SAVR. Our study is intended to address this problem. We systemically searched databases through MEDLINE, EMBASE, PUBMED, and the Cochrane Library up to September 2019. Two reviewers independently screened for the studies and evaluated bias. We used short-term mortality (in-hospital or 30-day mortality) as an outcome. A meta-analysis of TAVR with 115,596 patients ranging from 2005 to 2016 showed a result significantly in favor of high-volume hospitals (OR 0.43 (CI 0.36-0.51)). The subgroup of population period, region, data type, and cut-off value did not show any difference. A meta-analysis of SAVR comprising 418,384 patients ranging from 1994 to 2011 revealed that the OR of short-term mortality for a high-volume hospital compared with that of a low-volume hospital was 0.73 (CI 0.71, 0.74). No difference was observed in subgroups based on population period and cut-off. In conclusion, we found that short-term mortality was lower in high-volume hospitals for both TAVR and SAVR.  
[Overlapping Phenotype: Left Ventricular non-Compaction and Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy].  ;"Aim To study the clinical course of the mixed phenotype (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, HCMP, and left ventricular noncompaction, LVNC); to determine its genetic causes; and to evaluate incidence of cardiovascular complications (CVC) during the follow-up period.Material and methods In screening of 286 patients with HCMP, 8 of them (2.8 %; median age, 41.5 years; 4 men and 4 women) from unrelated families were found to have the mixed phenotype (combination of HCMP and LVNC). For their 10 first-degree relatives, the most frequent phenotype was HCMP without LVNC; however, both isolated LVNC and the mixed phenotype were also observed. Criteria for HCMP and LVNC were confirmed by echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging Genotyping was performed by high-throughput sequencing NGT using the TruSight Cardio Sequencing Panel kit.Results Probands with the HCMP+LVNC combination compared to first-degree relatives with isolated HCMP and LVNC were characterized by more pronounced left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction, 43.57±7.6 and 53.64±6.51 %, respectively; p&lt;0.001), a higher risk of CVC, and a higher incidence of ventricular tachyarrhythmias (7.9 and 2.2 %, respectively; p&lt;0.01). 11 mutations in 5 genes were found in 8 patients with the mixed phenotype. 72.7 % of mutations were in the MYH7 and MYBPC3 genes that encode the heavy chain of β-myosin and myosin-binding protein C, respectively; however, in some cases, replacements in other genes (DTNA, TGFB2) were also found.Conclusion The mixed phenotype (HCMP and LVNC) is associated with more severe clinical course of the disease and unfavorable CVC.

[The Distinguish Method of Severe Aortic Stenosis Treatment Geriatric High Mortality Risk Patients].  ;"Aim To improve quality of treatment for senile patients with pronounced aortic stenosis (AS).Material and methods Aortic valve stenosis (AS) is the most common valve pathology in cardiosurgical patients. Surgical correction of aortic valve (AV) stenosis accounts for 10 to 22 % of open-heart operations. 125 patients with pronounced AS were treated in the N. N. Burdenko Main Military Clinical Hospital between 2010 and 2017. This study was based on the implementation of new, minimally invasive methods in our clinic in 2013: balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAVP) of the aortic valve and transcatheter aortic valve prosthesis (TCAVP).Results In the group of patients receiving the drug therapy alone, the in-hospital mortality was 2 %. At the time of maximum follow-up duration (3 years), the survival rate was 50.5 %. In the group of patients who underwent the AV replacement with extracorporeal circulation, the 3 year postoperative mortality was 16.6 %. There was no 3 year mortality in the group of patients who underwent TCAVP. The short-term beneficial effect of BAVP was confirmed.Conclusion An algorithm was developed for medical care of patients older than 75 with pronounced AS; the place of BAVP in the step-by-step management of these patients was determined. Using the developed approach in the management of these patients provided a 32 % (p&lt;0.05) increase in the number of cases of radical surgical care.  "
Aortic valve replacement with or without concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting in very elderly patients aged 85 years and older.  ;"Degenerative aortic stenosis is the most common structural heart valve disease affecting the aging population. Catheter-based heart valve interventions are less invasive and very useful for very elderly patients. However, we often consider open heart surgery for these patients because of anatomical reasons and co-existing cardiac diseases, i.e., severe coronary artery disease. We aimed to analyze the outcomes of very elderly patients aged ≥ 85 years undergoing aortic valve replacement (AVR) with or without coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Twenty-nine very elderly patients aged ≥ 85 years who underwent AVR with CABG (n = 11, Group AC) or isolated AVR (n = 18, Group A) were examined. The overall mean age of the patients was 87.2 ± 2.6 (range 85-94) years. The estimated operative mortality rate, calculated using the Japan score, EuroSCORE II, and STS risk score, was 5.72%-10.88% in Group AC and 5.63%-8.30% in Group A. Aortic cross-clamp time (126.5 ± 29.0 vs. 96.9 ± 29.2 min, p = 0.016) was significantly longer in Group AC than in Group A. Although the major morbidity rate was higher in Group AC than in Group A (36% vs. 6%, p = 0.0336), the length of intensive care unit stay and hospital stay was comparable between both groups. There was no 30-day and hospital mortality in both groups. Eleven patients died during follow-up (senility, 5; cerebrovascular events, 2; renal failure, 1; unknown, 3). There were no significant differences in survival rates during follow-up (log-rank p value = 0.1051). The 1-, 2-, 3-, 4- and 5-year survival rates were 91%, 80%, 69%, 69% and 69%, respectively, in Group AC and 94%, 94%, 94%, 94% and 88%, respectively, in Group A. In conclusion, AVR with or without CABG could be safely performed in carefully selected very elderly patients with acceptable early- and long-term results. AVR with CABG in very elderly patients aged ≥ 85 offers similar results to isolated AVR in terms of 30-day mortality, hospital mortality, and long-term survival.  "
Tricuspid Regurgitation in Adults after Repair of Right Ventricular Outflow Obstructive Lesions.  ;We determined the prevalence and factors associated with tricuspid regurgitation (TR) in adults with repair of right ventricular (RV) outflow obstruction. A total of 256 patients (128 males) were studied at 25.7 ± 7.2 years after surgery, of whom 179 had repaired tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), 31 had pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum (PAIVS), and 46 had pulmonary stenosis (PS). The mitral and tricuspid annulus diameters, maximum right atrial (RA) area, RV end-systolic and end-diastolic areas, and tricuspid and pulmonary regurgitation were assessed using echocardiography. The prevalence of moderate-to-severe TR was 20.7%. Subgroup analysis revealed that prevalence was greater in patients with repaired TOF (20.7%) and PAIVS (35.5%) than PS patients (10.9%). As a group, severity of TR was found to be correlated with RA area (r = 0.35, p < 0.001), RV end-diastolic (r = 0.28, p < 0.001) and end-systolic (r = 0.22, p = 0.001) areas, and tricuspid valve annulus diameter (r = 0.15, p = 0.022). Moderate-to-severe TR was associated with development of cardiac arrhythmias with an odds ratio of 2.9 (95% CI 1.1 to 8.1, p = 0.031). Multivariate analysis revealed maximum RA area (β = 0.36, p = 0.016) as an independent determinant of severity of TR. Moderate-to-severe TR occurs in about one-fifth of adults with repaired TOF, PAVIS, and PS and is associated with RA dilation and risk of development of cardiac arrhythmias.  
"[Abdominal Apoplexy after Mitral Valve Replacement Due to Infective Endocarditis;Report of a Case].  ";A 52-year-old woman with mitral valve insufficiency and congestive heart failure due to infective endocarditis was treated by mitral valve replacement with a mechanical valve. Warfarin was started on postoperative day (POD) 3, but sudden onset of anemia with left abdominal pain presented on POD 8. Abdominal apoplexy was diagnosed by computed tomography (CT) and ultrasonographic imaging, but active bleeding was not evident. She was hemodynamically stable and her prothrombin time-international normalized ratio(PT-INR) at that time was 1.70 (compared with 2.56 on POD 7). To avoid repeated bleeding, PT-INR was controlled at around 1.5. Other complications did not arise, and thereafter her postoperative course was favorable.  
"[Bentall Procedure for Annuloaortic Ectasia in a Patient with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus;Report of a Case].  ";Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic inflammatory disease, rarely complicated with cardiac valvular abnormality or aortic aneurysm. An asymptomatic 40-year-old woman with a 15-year history of SLE developed annuloaortic ectasia and aortic valve regurgitation. She had long been maintained on steroid therapy for the treatment of SLE. Her serum anti-phospholipid antibodies were positive. An enhanced computed tomography revealed a dilated aortic root and ascending aorta (57 mm in diameter). Cardiac ultrasonography demonstrated severe aortic regurgitation. We performed the Bentall procedure using a composite graft with the Carrel patch technique. Histopathological examination of the aortic wall showed cystic medial necrosis without any evidence of vascu-litis. Careful long-term follow-up is mandatory for assessing the risk of later anastomotic dehiscence and pseudoaneurysm formation.  
[Minimally Invasive Cardiac Surgery Following Anesthesia Induction under Percutaneous Cardiopulmonary Support for Prosthetic Valve Dysfunction and Severe Pulmonary Hypertension in a Patient with Previous Mitral Valve Replacement].  ;A 47-year-old woman with a history of mitral valve replacement (MVR) through a median sternotomy was admitted to our hospital due to dyspnea on exertion. Echocardiography showed bioprosthetic valve dysfunction with mitral stenosis. Right heart catheter examination revealed severe pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular dysfunction. We considered that she could not tolerate the hemodynamic changes during induction of general anesthesia without any cardiopulmonary support. Therefore, the percutaneous cardiopulmonary support was started before induction of anesthesia. To avoid the risk of injury to cardiac structures, we performed redo mitral valve replacement via right mini-horacotomy in the 4th intercostal space. Severe calcification was found in the leaflets of the prosthetic valve. She was discharged home on postoperative day 42.  
"[Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation for Severe Aortic Stenosis with Preexisting Mitral Prosthesis;Report of a Case].  ";An 81-year-old woman presented with progressive congestive heart failure. Seventeen years before, she had undergone mitral valve replacement with a mechanical prosthesis. Echocardiography revealed severe aortic stenosis with a depressed left ventricular ejection fraction of 32%.At first, rescue balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV) was performed. After transient improvement of symptoms, she was readmitted 2 months later with recurrence of severe congestive heart failure. Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) with an Edwards Sapien valve was performed. During the procedure, BAV was performed to confirm that the balloon did not interfere the movement of the mechanical valve. Moreover, supported by a veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, we could prevent myocardial ischemia during rapid pacing and slowly deploy the valve in a precise position. TAVI can be safely and successfully performed in patients with a preexisting mechanical mitral prosthesis.  
[Combined Valvular Disease with Suspected Acquired von Willebrand Syndrome].  ;A 73-year-old female was referred to our department for surgical treatment of combined rheumatic valvular disease. She had undergone percutaneous transluminal mitral commissurotomy 29 years before. She underwent double valve replacement with bioprosthetic valves and tricuspid annuloplasty combined with left atrial appendectomy for chronic atrial fibrillation. Because of remarkable bleeding following surgery, rapid blood transfusion and re-thoracotomy were immediately performed. However, the bleeding persisted even after re-thoracotomy, and acquired von Willebrand syndrome due to valvular disease was suspected. Von Willebrand factor/factor Ⅷ preparation was administered, and bleeding promptly became under control. Recently, acquired von Willebrand syndrome due to valvular disease has attracted attention. We need to keep it in mind during perioperative management for patients with valvular disease.  
"[Complete Anterior Papillary Muscle Rupture with Angiographically Normal Coronary Arteries;Report of a Case].  ";We present a case of complete anterior papillary muscle rupture (PMR) due to localized papillary muscle infarction, without significant coronary artery disease. A 69-year-old woman was transferred to our hospital because of acute orthopnea and cardiogenic shock. Echocardiography showed severe mitral regurgitation due to anterior PMR, and emergency coronary angiography revealed no obstructive disease in the coronary arteries. Emergency mitral valve replacement was performed with intra-aortic balloon pumping support. Intraoperatively, the anterolateral papillary muscle was found to be completely ruptured. With maximal posterior leaflet preservation, mitral valve replacement was successfully performed. Her postoperative course was uneventful. Pathologic examination showed both old fibrosis and new ischemic lesion in the same resected papillary muscle. It could be speculated that repeated localized subendocardial infarction caused so-called spontaneous PMR.  
Impact of procedural capacity on transcatheter aortic valve replacement wait times and outcomes: a study of regional variation in Ontario, Canada.  ;"BACKGROUND: There has been rapid growth in the demand for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), which has the potential to overwhelm current capacity. This imbalance between demand and capacity may lead to prolonged wait times, and subsequent adverse outcomes while patients are on the waitlist. We sought to understand the relationship between regional differences in capacity, TAVR wait times and morbidity/mortality on the waitlist. METHODS AND RESULTS: We modelled the effect of TAVR capacity, defined as the number of TAVR procedures per million residents/region, on the hazard of having a TAVR in Ontario from April 2012 to March 2017. Our primary outcome was the time from referral to a TAVR procedure or other off-list reasons on the waitlist/end of the observation period as measured in days. Clinical outcomes of interest were all-cause mortality, all-cause hospitalisations or heart failure-related hospitalisations while on the waitlist for TAVR. There was an almost fourfold difference in TAVR capacity across the 14 regions in Ontario, ranging from 31.5 to 119.5 TAVR procedures per million residents. The relationship between TAVR capacity and wait times was complex and non-linear. In general, increased capacity was associated with shorter wait times (p<0.001), reduced mortality (HR 0.94; p=0.08) and all-cause hospitalisations (p=0.009). CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study have important policy implications, suggesting that there is a need to improve TAVR capacity, as well as develop wait-time strategies to triage patients, in order to decrease wait times and mitigate the hazard of adverse patient outcomes while on the waitlist.

Impact of device landing zone calcification patterns on paravalvular regurgitation after transcatheter aortic valve replacement with different next-generation devices.  ;"OBJECTIVE: Residual paravalvular regurgitation (PVR) has been associated to adverse outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). This study sought to evaluate the impact of device landing zone (DLZ) calcification on residual PVR after TAVR with different next-generation transcatheter heart valves. METHODS: 642 patients underwent TAVR with a SAPIEN 3 (S3; n=292), ACURATE neo (NEO; n=166), Evolut R (ER; n=132) or Lotus (n=52). Extent, location and asymmetry of DLZ calcification were assessed from contrast-enhanced CT imaging and correlated to PVR at discharge. RESULTS: PVR was ≥moderate in 0.7% of S3 patients, 9.6% of NEO patients, 9.8% of ER patients and 0% of Lotus patients (p<0.001), and these differences remained after matching for total DLZ calcium volume. The amount of DLZ calcium was significantly related to the degree of PVR in patients treated with S3 (p=0.045), NEO (p=0.004) and ER (p<0.001), but not in Lotus patients (p=0.698). The incidence of PVR ≥moderate increased significantly over the tertiles of DLZ calcium volume (p=0.046). On multivariable analysis, calcification of the aortic valve cusps, LVOT calcification and the use of self-expanding transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) prostheses emerged as predictors of PVR. CONCLUSIONS: The susceptibility to PVR depending on the amount of calcium was mainly observed in self-expanding TAVI prostheses. Thus, DLZ calcification is an important factor to be considered in prosthesis selection for each individual patient, keeping in mind the trade-off between PVR reduction, risk of new pacemaker implantation and unfavourable valve ha emodynamics.

Validation of a simplified score for predicting latent rheumatic heart disease progression using a prospective cohort of Brazilian schoolchildren.  ;OBJECTIVES: Echocardiographic (echo) screening is an important tool to estimate rheumatic heart disease (RHD) prevalence, but the natural history of screen-detected RHD remains unclear. The PROVAR+ (Programa de RastreamentO da VAlvopatia Reumática) study, which uses non-experts, telemedicine and portable echo, pioneered RHD screening in Brazil. We aimed to assess the mid-term evolution of Brazilian schoolchildren (5-18 years) with echocardiography-detected subclinical RHD and to assess the performance of a simplified score consisting of five components of the World Heart Federation criteria, as a predictor of unfavourable echo outcomes. SETTING: Public schools of underserved areas and private schools in Minas Gerais, southeast Brazil. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 197 patients (170 borderline and 27 definite RHD) with follow-up of 29±9 months were included. Median age was 14 (12-16) years, and 130 (66%) were woman. Only four patients in the definite group were regularly receiving penicillin. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Unfavourable outcome was based on the 2-year follow-up echo, defined as worsening diagnostic category, remaining with mild definite RHD or development/worsening of valve regurgitation/stenosis. RESULTS: Among patients with borderline RHD, 29 (17.1%) progressed to definite, 49 (28.8%) remained stable, 86 (50.6%) regressed to normal and 6 (3.5%) were reclassified as other heart diseases. Among those with definite RHD, 13 (48.1%) remained in the category, while 5 (18.5%) regressed to borderline, 5 (18.5%) regressed to normal and 4 (14.8%) were reclassified as other heart diseases. The simplified echo score was a significant predictor of RHD unfavourable outcome (HR 1.197, 95% CI 1.098 to 1.305, p<0.001). CONCLUSION: The simple risk score provided an accurate prediction of RHD status at 2-year follow-up, showing a good performance in Brazilian schoolchildren, with a potential value for risk stratification and monitoring of echocardiography-detected RHD.  
[On-pump total arterial revascularization in coronary artery disease patients with left ventricular dysfunction: a multi-center retrospective study].  ;"Objective: To evaluate the clinical outcomes of on-pump total arterial revascularization with bilateral radial artery (BRA) and left internal mammary artery (LIMA) as conduits in coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) patients with left ventricular dysfunction (LVD). Methods: All the perioperative medical records and follow-up results of coronary artery disease patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 40% undergoing CABG from 24 heart centers of 15 provinces and autonomous regions in China between July 2015 and December 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. Results: A total of 87 consecutive patients (55 males and 32 females) underwent on-pump CABG with BRA and LIMA, with a mean age of (57.5±9.1) years old. There were 22 patients complicated with primary hypertension, 12 with diabetes mellitus, 8 with peripheral vascular disease, 7 with chronic obstructive lung disease, 12 with mild renal injury and 3 with partial aortic calcification. There were 43 cases with in-stent stenosis, and 21 had left main disease. The mean LVEF and left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD) was (35.5±7.3)% and (65.5±2.6) mm, respectively. The mean graft number, aortic cross-clamp time and cardiopulmonary bypass duration was 3.2±0.9, (90.5±22.7) min and (113.4±19.2) min, respectively. There were 32 mitral and 9 aortic valve replacements, and 5 tricuspid annuloplasties. Prophylactic intra-aortic balloon pumps were implanted in 27 patients. There were 2 operative deaths from acute heart failure. After surgery, there were 15 cases of atrial fibrillation, 1 case of acute kidney injury, 1 case of acute myocardial infarction, and 1 cases of stroke. All the patients fulfilled the follow-up, with a mean time of (39.5±7.7) months. At 3 months after surgery, LVEDD was decreased and LVEF was improved significantly compared with pre-operative indicators [(53.0±1.5) mm vs (65.5±2.6) mm, t=9.51 P=0.02; (45.2±3.3)% vs (35.5±7.3)%, t=13.79, P=0.001]. No major cardiac events were reported during the follow-up. At (30.5±7.4) months after surgery, 62.4% of patients (53/85) underwent coronary CT angiography examination, and the results indicated that the graft patency was 98.8%, with only one case of RA occlusion occurred. Conclusion: In selected patients of LVD, on-pump total arterial revascularization with BRA and LIMA conduits was proved to be safe and effective.  "
[Coronary artery bypass grafting surgery in left ventricular dysfunction patients complicated with mitral regurgitation].  ;Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery in left ventricular dysfunction patients complicated with different degrees of ischemic mitral regurgitation (IMR). Methods: The clinical data of 525 patients (428 males and 97 females) undergoing CABG in Fuwai Hospital Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences Shenzhen, and Tianjin Medical University General Hospital between January 2015 and December 2018 were collected. The average age was (61±7) years old. Among them, the patients with moderate to serve IMR and left ventricular ejection fraction(LVEF)≤40% were further selected, and the outcomes of CABG were analyzed. Results: In total, 67 patients (48 males and 19 females) with moderate to severe IMR and LVEF≤40% were enrolled, among which 52 patients had moderate IMR, with a LVEF of 38%(35%, 40%). Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) of 52 cases displayed no damage of papillary muscles, and ventricular wall motion was improved after CABG. Therefore, no treatment on the mitral valve was performed in this group. Six patients were with moderate-severe mitral insufficiency, with a LVEF of 38%(35%, 39%). After surgery, TEE found that the ventricular wall motion and regurgitation were improved, and the mitral valve structures were well. Thus, mitral valves were not treated in these patients. Nine patients were with severe mitral regurgitation, with a LVEF of 38%(35%, 39%). Two of them received valve repair because the papillary muscle function and the ring were well. Another 7 patients received valve replacements because the valve ring was dilatated and the leaflet was prolapsed. All patients recovered well. The LVEF increased significantly at 6 months after surgery [47%(45%, 48%) vs 38%(35%, 39%), P=0.024], and the left ventricular end diastolic diameter also became smaller [57(56, 59) mm vs 61(59, 64) mm, P=0.002]. Conclusions: For patients suffered from left ventricular dysfunction complicated with IMR, TEE is crucial to evaluate the valve function. To those with moderate-severe regurgitation, if papillary muscle function and the ring were seriously affected by ischemia, the valve replacement could facilitate the improvement of postoperative cardiac function.  
Investigating gene-microRNA networks in atrial fibrillation patients with mitral valve regurgitation.  ;BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is predicted to affect around 17.9 million individuals in Europe by 2060. The disease is associated with severe electrical and structural remodelling of the heart, and increased the risk of stroke and heart failure. In order to improve treatment and find new drug targets, the field needs to better comprehend the exact molecular mechanisms in these remodelling processes. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to identify gene and miRNA networks involved in the remodelling of AF hearts in AF patients with mitral valve regurgitation (MVR). METHODS: Total RNA was extracted from right atrial biopsies from patients undergoing surgery for mitral valve replacement or repair with AF and without history of AF to test for differentially expressed genes and miRNAs using RNA-sequencing and miRNA microarray. In silico predictions were used to construct a mRNA-miRNA network including differentially expressed mRNAs and miRNAs. Gene and chromosome enrichment analysis were used to identify molecular pathways and high-density AF loci. RESULTS: We found 644 genes and 43 miRNAs differentially expressed in AF patients compared to controls. From these lists, we identified 905 pairs of putative miRNA-mRNA interactions, including 37 miRNAs and 295 genes. Of particular note, AF-associated miR-130b-3p, miR-338-5p and miR-208a-3p were differentially expressed in our AF tissue samples. These miRNAs are predicted regulators of several differentially expressed genes associated with cardiac conduction and fibrosis. We identified two high-density AF loci in chromosomes 14q11.2 and 6p21.3. CONCLUSIONS: AF in MVR patients is associated with down-regulation of ion channel genes and up-regulation of extracellular matrix genes. Other AF related genes are dysregulated and several are predicted to be targeted by miRNAs. Our novel miRNA-mRNA regulatory network provides new insights into the mechanisms of AF.  
Technical considerations for repeat transcatheter aortic valve implantation in a failing Direct Flow Medical transcatheter heart valve.  ;DOI: 10.4244/EIJ-D-20-00426 PMID: 32392170 [Indexed for MEDLINE]  
Inherited Thoracic Aortic Disease: New Insights and Translational Targets.  ;Inherited thoracic aortopathies denote a group of congenital conditions that predispose to disease of the thoracic aorta. Aortic wall weakness and abnormal aortic hemodynamic profiles predispose these patients to dilatation of the thoracic aorta, which is generally silent but can precipitate aortic dissection or rupture with devastating and often fatal consequences. Current strategies to assess the future risk of aortic dissection or rupture are based primarily on monitoring aortic diameter. However, diameter alone is a poor predictor of risk, with many patients experiencing dissection or rupture below current intervention thresholds. Developing tools that improve the risk assessment of those with aortopathy is internationally regarded as a research priority. A robust understanding of the molecular pathways that lead to aortic wall weakness is required to identify biomarkers and therapeutic targets that could improve patient management. Here, we summarize the current understanding of the genetically determined mechanisms underlying inherited aortopathies and critically appraise the available blood biomarkers, imaging techniques, and therapeutic targets that have shown promise for improving the management of patients with these important and potentially fatal conditions.  
The impact of moderate Aortic Valve Disease in patients undergoing MitraClip for severe MR.  ;"BACKGROUND: High surgical risk patients presenting with severe mitral valve regurgitation (MR) and concomitant aortic valve disease are frequently a challenge for the interdisciplinary heart team meeting. If open-heart surgery for severe MR is performed, aortic stenosis (AS) or regurgitation (AR) is corrected during the same procedure if at least moderate severity of AS or AR has been confirmed. In patients with prohibitive surgical risk, optimal management strategies in the light of available transcatheter interventions still needs to be established. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this retrospective single center study, we aimed to investigate the impact of coincident moderate aortic valve disease on the outcome of patients undergoing MitraClip for severe MR. In 286 MitraClip procedures performed in our institution, 21 patients (7,3%) were identified to suffer from concomitant moderate AS and 28 patients had moderate AR (9,8%). Patients with AS were found to have a higher incidence of >moderate MR following the procedure when compared to patients without aortic valve disease (14,3% vs. 8,9%, p = 0.001). No differences between the groups were found regarding a combined endpoint of all cause deaths and heart failure hospitalizations after 1 year follow up (no aortic-valve disease vs. moderate AS: 19% vs 18%; p = 0,881 and no aortic valve disease vs moderate AR: 19% vs. 25%; p = 0.477). However, mortality was significantly higher in patients with coincidental moderate AR (3.8% patients without aortic valve disease, 5% in patients with AS, 17,9% in patients with AR; p = 0.006). CONCLUSION: According to our analysis coincidental Aortic valve stenosis may be associated with worse technical results regarding residual MR after MitraClip. Although our results regarding a combined endpoint of all-cause mortality and heart failure hospitalizations within one year of follow up were comparable between the groups, patients with moderate AR had significantly higher mortality rates. Due to the limited number of patients, our study is only hypothesis generating. Larger trials are necessary to confirm our result.  "

Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation-supported percutaneous angioplasty of coronary button stenosis after aortic root replacement.  ;BACKGROUND AND AIM: A 73-year-old female patient had right coronary button stenosis following aortic root replacement. METHODS: Myocardial ischemia led to hemodynamic instability followed by cardiogenic shock, which was successfully managed using venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation-supported right coronary button angioplasty. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Although the incidence of such complications is low, it is a life-threatening event that requires prompt diagnosis and it may pose a challenging clinical scenario for the treating team.  
Infective endocarditis in patients with cardiac implantable electronic devices: a nationwide study.  ;"AIMS: Patients with infective endocarditis (IE) frequently have cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs). Here, we aim to define the clinical profile and prognostic factors of IE in these patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: Infective endocarditis cases were prospectively identified in the Spanish National Endocarditis Registry. From 3996 IE, 708 (17.7%) had a CIED and 424 CIED-related IE (lead vegetation). Patients with a CIED were older (68 ± 11 vs. 73 ± 8 years); had more comorbidities {pulmonary disease [176 (24.8%) vs. 545 (16.7%)], renal disease [239 (33.8%) vs. 740 (22.7%)], diabetes [248 (35.0%) vs. 867 (26.6%)], and heart failure [348 (49.2%) vs. 978 (29.9%)]}; and fewer complications {intracardiac destruction [106 (15%) vs. 1077 (33.1%)], heart failure [215 (30.3%) vs. 1340 (41.1%)], embolism [107 (15.1%) vs. 714 (21.9%)], and neurological involvement [77 (10.8%) vs. 702 (21.5%)]} (all P-values <0.001) in comparison to subjects without a CIED. In-hospital mortality was similar in patients with and without CIED [171 (24.2%) vs. 881 (27.0%), P = 0.82]. In subjects with a CIED, CIED-related IE was independently associated with in-hospital survival: odds ratio (OR) 0.4 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.3-0.7, P = 0.001]. Surgery was independently associated with in-hospital survival in CIED-related IE: OR 0.4 (95% CI 0.2-0.7, P = 0.004); but not in subjects with valve IE and no CIED lead involvement: OR 0.9 (95% CI 0.5-1.7, P = 0.77). CONCLUSION: Over a sixth of IE patients have a CIED. This group of patients is older, with more comorbidities and fewer IE-related complications in comparison to subjects without a CIED. In-hospital mortality was similar in patients with and without a CIED.  "

"The Quandary of the Quadricuspid Aortic Valve-The ""Unlucky"" 4-Leaf Clover: Case Report and Brief Clinical Review.  ";The quadricuspid aortic valve is an exceedingly rare congenital valvular anomaly, characterized by a tetrad of leaflets that typically presents with aortic regurgitation. Almost one third of cases are associated with coexisting cardiac defects with one fifth warranting surgical intervention. In this article, we describe the first documented-in-Caribbean case and present a brief clinical review of its pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management.  
Cardiac AA amyloidosis in a patient with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  ;Cardiac amyloid A (AA) amyloidosis is rare. We present the case of a 72-year-old woman with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and biopsy-proven renal AA amyloidosis whose dyspnea and exercise intolerance had worsened over the previous year. Her AA amyloidosis was suspected to be secondary to chronic diverticulitis for which she had undergone hemicolectomy and sigmoidectomy 3 years prior. Echocardiographic findings were consistent with worsening left ventricular outflow tract obstruction at rest. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging revealed patchy areas of midwall late gadolinium enhancement. Right ventricular endomyocardial biopsy did not reveal amyloid deposition, and cardiac technetium-99m pyrophosphate scintigraphy did not suggest transthyretin amyloidosis. The patient underwent septal myectomy with resection of an accessory papillary muscle. Pathological examination of the myectomy specimen was consistent with HCM. In addition, there was a thick layer of diffuse endocardial and vascular amyloid deposition that was identified as AA type by laser-microdissection with liquid chromatography-coupled tandem-mass spectrometry. This case report highlights the presence of 2 distinct disease processes occurring simultaneously and the importance of tissue diagnosis of AA amyloidosis, a condition that is not commonly associated with HCM.  
Effects of rivaroxaban and dabigatran on local expression of coagulation and inflammatory factors within human aortic stenotic valves.  ;BACKGROUND: Treatment with non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) such as dabigatran (a direct thrombin inhibitor) or rivaroxaban (a direct inhibitor of factor [F] Xa) attenuates atherosclerotic plaque progression in hypercholesterolemic mice. PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of NOACs application on the expression of coagulation proteins in loco within stenotic aortic valves and in valve interstitial cells (VICs) from patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS). METHODS: Primary cultures of VICs obtained from 90 patients undergoing aortic valve replacement were stimulated with TNF-α (50 ng/mL) and pre-treated with rivaroxaban (1 and 10 ng/mL) or dabigatran (25 and 250 ng/mL). The expression of coagulation proteins was analyzed by immunofluorescence. Cytokine levels were measured by ELISA. RESULTS: FX, FXa, FVII, thrombin and PAR1/2 were present in loco within human aortic stenotic valves. Cultured VICs exhibited constant expression of FX, TF, PAR1/2. Exposure of VICs to TNF-α caused the upregulated expression of TF, PAR1/2 and induced expression of thrombin, FVII and FXa. FX was expressed by 80% of VICs, regardless of stimulation. Cultured VICs were able to synthesize metalloproteinases 1-3, IL-6, IL-32, IL-34, osteopontin and osteocalcin, the levels of which increased under TNF-α stimulation. NOACs added to culture inhibited coagulation factor and PAR1/2 expression. Moreover, NOACs down-regulated VIC-derived proteins responsible for valve calcification and extracellular matrix remodeling. CONCLUSIONS: NOACs at therapeutic concentrations may inhibit the effects of FXa and thrombin at in vitro level. It might be speculated that long-term treatment with rivaroxaban or dabigatran could attenuate the progression of AS in humans.  
Impact of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement on Risk Profiles of Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement Patients.  ;BACKGROUND: The advent of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has changed which patients undergo surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). We sought to understand the impact of TAVR on the characteristics of SAVR patients in the United States. METHODS: A cohort of 2959 patients who underwent isolated SAVR at 11 US hospitals that perform both TAVR and SAVR from 2013 through 2017 were grouped by the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) Adult Cardiac Surgery Database version (v)2.73 (2011-2014), v2.81 (2014-2017), and v2.9 (2017) to assess temporal trends in patient characteristics. RESULTS: Over time, SAVR patients were younger with fewer preoperative comorbidities. There was a significant decrease in median STS predicted risk of mortality (PROM) score (2.0 vs. 1.8 vs. 1.3, p < 0.001, in v2.73 vs. v2.81 vs. v2.9). Specifically, there were fewer high-risk (STS PROM > 8%: 4.3% vs. 4.7% vs. 1.2%, p = 0.03) and intermediate-risk (STS PROM 4% to 8%: 16.3% vs. 11.7% vs. 4.3%, p < 0.001) patients. The proportion of patients with bicuspid aortic valve disease increased significantly (11.2% vs. 26.9% vs. 36.6%, p < 0.001). There were no differences in operative mortality (1.9% vs. 2.1% vs. 1.4%, p = 0.75). CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of TAVR has already impacted the demographics, clinical characteristics and risk profiles of patients undergoing SAVR in the US. Now that TAVR is approved for low-risk patients, SAVR is likely to be reserved for younger patients who are willing to receive a mechanical valve and for patients with aortopathy, coronary artery disease, or concomitant mitral or tricuspid pathology.  
Results of transcarotid compared with transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve replacement.  ;"OBJECTIVES: The femoral artery is the preferred vascular access to perform transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). However, the optimal alternative approach has not been elucidated in patients who are not candidates for a transfemoral (TF) access. The objective of this study was to compare the outcomes of TAVR performed by the transcarotid (TC) compared with the TF approach. METHODS: This was a single-center study that included 526 consecutive patients who underwent TAVR between 2015 and 2019. TC-TAVR was performed in 127 and TF-TAVR in 399 patients. Postprocedural and 30-day clinical events were evaluated according to main access (TC vs TF) using a multivariate logistic regression model. One-year survival and freedom from neurological events were also evaluated. RESULTS: The prevalence of diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary artery disease, and peripheral vascular disease was higher in the TC group. In-hospital mortality (3.2% vs 2.0%, adjusted odds ratio, 1.83; 95% confidence interval, 0.47-7.15; P = .39), and 30-day stroke (2.4% vs 3.3%; odds ratio, 0.84; 95% confidence interval, 0.21-3.41; P = .81), were similar between groups as were other outcomes: procedural success (98.4% vs 97.0%; P = .52), 30-day cumulative mortality (4.8% vs 2.8%; P = .26), major vascular complication (2.4% vs 4.5%; P = .25), and major/life-threatening bleeding (4.7% vs 6.0%; P = .41) (TC vs TF, respectively). No differences were found among groups regarding survival or neurological events at 1-year follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The TC approach is a safe alternate-access strategy for TAVR, and is associated with similar outcomes compared with TF-TAVR, despite a higher disease burden in TC patients.  "
Early Outcome in Patients Requiring Conversion to General Anesthesia During Transfemoral Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.  ;Transfemoral Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (tf-TAVI) has become an established therapy-option for patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis. Conscious sedation (CS) has proven to be an alternative to general anesthesia . So far, the outcome of patients undergoing unplanned periprocedural conversion from CS to general anesthesia has not been investigated. All patients undergoing transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation in CS between 2014 and 2019 were included. The primary end point was early safety at 30 days according to Valve Academic Research Consortium-2 criteria. The reasons for conversion and length of ICU-/ hospital stay were further analyzed. Of 1,058 included patients 35 (3.3%) required a conversion. The end point was documented in 13 (37%) of the converted and 110 (11%) of nonconverted patients (p < 0.001). The causes were: unrest in 11/35 patients, procedural complications in 10/35 patients, respiratory distress in 8/35, and cardiovascular decompensation in 6 patients (17.1%). Compared with the group without conversion (Median (interquartile range ), 4 [4-5] days), length of hospital stay was longest in the group with procedural complications (6 [1-11] days) followed by cardiovascular decompensation (5 [4-7] days). In conclusion, the conversion rate to general anesthesia was low in a large cohort of unselected transcatheter aortic valve implantation patients. Additionally, hospital stay was longer dependent on the reason for conversion.  
Comparison of microstructural alterations in the proximal aorta between aortic stenosis and regurgitation.  ;OBJECTIVE: We aimed to analyze the association among flow patterns, gene expression, and histologic alterations of the proximal aorta in patients with aortic valve disease. METHODS: A total of 131 patients referred for aortic valve replacement were grouped by valve dysfunction (aortic stenosis vs aortic regurgitation) and valve morphology (bicuspid vs tricuspid). On the basis of magnetic resonance imaging, aortic tissue from outer and inner curvature was collected for gene expression and histologic analysis. To identify differences in aortic remodeling, age- and sex-adjusted data for inflammation (CCL2, VCAM1, inflammation and atherosclerosis) and medial degeneration (COL1A1, ELN, fibrosis, elastin fragmentation, and cystic medial necrosis) were compared. RESULTS: First, we compared all patients with aortic regurgitation (n = 64) and patients with aortic stenosis (n = 67). In patients with aortic regurgitation, COL1A1 expression and all histologic markers were significantly increased. With respect to aortic diameter, all subsequent analyses were refined by considering only individuals with aortic diameter 40 mm or greater. Second, patients with bicuspid aortic valve were compared, resulting in a similar aortic diameter. Although patients with aortic regurgitation were younger, no differences were found in gene expression or histologic level. Third, valve morphology was compared in patients with aortic regurgitation. Although aortic diameter was similar, patients with regurgitant bicuspid aortic valve were younger than patients with regurgitant tricuspid aortic valve. Inflammatory markers were similar, whereas markers for medial degeneration were increased in patients with regurgitant tricuspid aortic valve. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the proximal aorta in patients with aortic regurgitation showed an increased inflammation and medial degeneration compared with patients with aortic stenosis. Refining both groups by valve morphology, in patients with bicuspid aortic valve, no difference except age was detected between aortic regurgitation and aortic stenosis. In patients with aortic regurgitation, tricuspid aortic valve revealed increased markers for medial degeneration but no differences regarding inflammatory markers.

Three-dimensional echocardiography assessment of carcinoid valvular heart disease: Images of each and all.  ;A 54-year-old male was found to have neuroendocrine carcinoma with hepatic metastasis. Two-dimensional (2D) transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) demonstrated dilated right ventricle and right atrium, and severe tricuspid and pulmonary regurgitation. Three-dimensional (3D) TTE en-face views showed thickened, retracted, and fixed tricuspid valve and pulmonic valve which remained widely open throughout the cardiac cycle. 3D TTE, particularly en-face views, demonstrates incremental value over 2D TTE by providing precise valvular anatomic details comparable to surgical findings. 3D TTE also offers a unique opportunity to assess all four valves simultaneously with en-face views to delineate their relationships with surrounding structures.  
First-in-human transcatheter pledget-assisted suture tricuspid annuloplasty for severe tricuspid insufficiency.  ;"OBJECTIVES: We report the first pledget-assisted suture tricuspid annuloplasty (PASTA) in a patient with torrential tricuspid regurgitation (TR). BACKGROUND: Tricuspid valve regurgitation is a common malignant disease with no commercially available transcatheter therapy. PASTA is a ""percutaneous surgical"" procedure using pledgeted sutures to create a double-orifice tricuspid valve. METHODS: An 83-year-old man had end-stage TR caused by a defibrillator lead. He consented to undergo PASTA on a compassionate basis. A double-orifice valve was created with pledgeted sutures from percutaneous right ventricular apical access. RESULTS: TR was reduced from torrential to trace. The vena contracta reduced to from 23 to 1 mm and annular area reduced from 1817 to 782 mm2 . However, the annulus dehisced and required closure with a percutaneous nitinol plug. The patient was discharged home and was alive 6 months later but with persistent symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The anatomy of a double-orifice valve can eliminate TR but a better solution is required to avoid excessive suture tension on annular tissue.  "
Percutaneous Mitral Valve Repair With MitraClip in Inoperable Patients With Severe Mitral Regurgitation Complicated by Cardiogenic Shock.  ;BACKGROUND: Severe mitral regurgitation (MR) complicated by cardiogenic shock has high operative mortality. Percutaneous leaflet repair with MitraClip (Abbott Vascular) is a less invasive alternative to surgery. The effectiveness and safety of this approach is unknown. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed procedural characteristics of shock patients with severe MR treated with MitraClip in a tertiary, high-volume program (Abbott Northwestern Hospital, Minneapolis, Minnesota) during 2010-2019. The primary outcome of the study was 30-day survival free of significant MR (grade ≤2). One-year mortality was a secondary outcome. RESULTS: Among 322 patients who underwent MitraClip implantation during the study period, 11 inoperable patients with severe MR and cardiogenic shock were included in this analysis. Mean patient age was 74 ± 11 years and 54% were male. The mechanism of MR was degenerative in 7 patients (63.6%) and functional in 4 patients (36.4%), including 1 post myocardial infarction, 1 with chronic ischemic heart disease, and 2 with end-stage non-ischemic cardiomyopathy. Hemodynamic support with intra-aortic balloon pump was used in 5 patients (45%). The A2-P2 scallop was the more common location for MitraClip insertion, and 27% of patients had >1 clip implanted. Median fluoroscopy time was 18.5 minutes (interquartile range [IQR], 10-22 minutes) and mean postprocedure gradient was 4.5 mm Hg (IQR, 3-5 mm Hg). At 30 days, eight patients (72.7%) were alive with MR grade ≤2. At 1 year, mortality was 66%, and was driven mainly by non-cardiac causes. CONCLUSIONS: Among inoperable patients with severe MR and cardiogenic shock, percutaneous leaflet repair with MitraClip is associated with acceptable short-term effectiveness.

Very late-onset endocarditis complicated by non-significant aortic regurgitation after device closure of perimembranous ventricular septal defect.  ;INTRODUCTION: Aortic regurgitation (AR) was recognized as a major, but rare complication after device closure for perimembranous ventricular septal defects (PmVSD). Most of them are temporary and non-significant. Infectious endocarditis (IE) is another extremely rare post-procedure complication of PmVSD. Theoretically, AR could increase risk for post-interventional IE. However, no cases have been documented thus far. We firstly described a case of very late-onset IE associated with non-significant AR after transcatheter closure of PmVSD with modified symmetrical double-disk device, underscoring the need for reassessing long-term prognostic implications of non-significant post-procedure AR after PmVSD occlusion and the most appropriate treatment strategy. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 15-year old male received transcatheter closure of a 6.4 mm sized PmVSD with a 9-mm modified symmetric double-disk occluder (SHAMA) 11 years ago in our hospital. A new-onset mild eccentric AR was noted on transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) examination 1-year post procedure, without progression and heart enlargement. At this time, the child was admitted with a complaint of persistent fever for 16 days and nonresponse to 2-weeks course of amoxicillin and cefoxitin. DIAGNOSIS: The diagnosis of post-procedure IE was established since a vegetation (14 × 4 mm) was found to be attached to the tricuspid valve, an anechoic area (8 × 7 mm) on left upper side of ventricular septum and below right aortic sinus, and severe eccentric AR as well as the isolation of Staphylococcus aureus from all three-blood cultures. INTERVENTIONS: Treatment with vancomycin was initially adopted. However, surgical interventions including removal of vegetation, abscess and occluder, closure of VSD with a pericardial patch, tricuspid valvuloplasty, and aortic valvuloplasty were ultimately performed because of recurrent fever and a new-onset complete atrioventricular block 12-days later. The child continued with antibiotic therapy up to six weeks post operation. OUTCOMES: The child's temperature gradually returned to normal with alleviation of AR (mild) and heart block (first degree). The following course was uneventful. CONCLUSION: Late-onset IE could occur following device closure of PmVSD and be associated with post-procedure AR. For non-significant AR after device closure of PmVSD, early surgical intervention could be an alternative for reducing the aggravation of aortic valve damage and the risk of associated IE.  
Incidental detection of a retained left atrial catheter via intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography in a patient undergoing tricuspid valve replacement: A case report.  ;RATIONALE: A cardiac foreign body can cause thrombosis or infection, but sometimes it may not cause any symptoms in a patient. The diagnosis is mainly performed using a radiological examination. Especially, ultrasound is useful not only for detecting the foreign body but also for hemodynamic findings. However, the disadvantage of ultrasound is that it cannot be used where shadows are generated because of poor permeability. The transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is superior to transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) for identifying posterior cardiac structures because the probe is located in the esophagus behind the heart. Here, we report on the incidental finding of a foreign body in the left atrium through TEE during cardiac surgery. It did not cause any symptoms or signs for 20 years. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 75-year-old female patient with severe tricuspid regurgitation underwent tricuspid valve replacement (TVR) under general anesthesia. She had a history of mitral valve replacement (MVR) and tricuspid annuloplasty surgery 20 years ago. DIAGNOSIS: A hyper-echoic floating intracardiac foreign body was observed in the left atrium during TEE examination. It was not detected in the preoperative imaging studies such as X-ray, computed tomography, TTE. INTERVENTIONS: The cardiac foreign body found using TEE was visually confirmed through an incision in the left atrium. A long and thin foreign body was located in the right upper pulmonary vein to the left atrium, which was considered to be a left atrial catheter used during the MVR surgery performed 20 years ago. After removing the foreign body, the planned TVR operation proceeded. OUTCOMES: After removing the intracardiac foreign body and TVR, the patient was admitted into the intensive care unit followed by the general ward as planned, and discharged without any complications. LESSONS: TEE was very useful for diagnosing a foreign body in the posterior part of the heart. TEE performed during the perioperative period should be performed beyond the level of re-confirming the findings of TEE performed prior to surgery. If a retained catheter is detected, it may be appropriate to remove it considering the risk of complications.  
Age, Sex, and Valve Phenotype Differences in Fibro-Calcific Remodeling of Calcified Aortic Valve.  ;"Background In calcific aortic valve disease on tricuspid aortic valves (TAVs), men have higher aortic valve calcification and less fibrosis than women. However, little is known in bicuspid aortic valves (BAV). We thus aimed to investigate the impact of age, sex, and valve phenotype (TAVs versus BAVs) on fibro-calcific remodeling in calcific aortic valve disease. Methods and Results We included 2 cohorts: 411 patients who underwent multidetector computed tomography (37% women) for aortic valve calcification density assessment and 138 explanted aortic valves (histological cohort; 50% women). The cohorts were divided in younger (<60 years old) or older patients with BAV (≥60 years old), and TAV patients. In each group, women and men were matched. Women presented less aortic valve calcification density than men in each group of the multidetector computed tomography cohort (all P≤0.01). Moreover, in women, younger patients with BAV had the lowest aortic valve calcification density (both P=0.02). In multivariate analysis, aortic valve calcification density correlated with age (β estimate±standard error: 6.5±1.8; P=0.0004) and male sex (109.2±18.4; P<0.0001), and there was a trend with TAVs (41.5±23.0; P=0.07). Women presented a higher collagen content than men (77.8±10.8 versus 69.9±12.9%; P<0.001) in the entire cohort. In women, younger patients with BAV had denser connective tissue than TAV and older patients with BAV (both P≤0.05), while no difference was observed between men. Conclusions In calcific aortic valve disease, women had less calcification and more fibrotic remodeling than men, regardless of the phenotype of the valve or age of the patient. Moreover, younger women with BAVs had less valve calcification. Thus, mineralization/fibrosis of the aortic valve is likely to have sex/age-specific mechanisms and be influenced by the valve morphology.  "

[MINIMALLY INVASIVE APPROACH IN THE SURGICAL TREATMENT OF THE ASCENDING AORTA PATHOLOGY: ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES].  ;The aim - to improve the results of surgical treatment of ascending aorta pathology in combination with aortic valve disease by minimizing operative trauma for the purpose of rapid physical recovery of patients. In National Amosov Institute of Cardiovascular Surgery from 01/01/2015 to 31/12/2019 65 patients were operated due to isolated aneurysms of the ascending aorta of small diameter and in combination with lesions of the aortic valve in whom upper J-shaped mininotomy was applied as an access. Comparison group which included 61 patients, where the traditional median sternotomy was used. There were no lethal outcomes. The intervention time was 220-380 minutes (mean 279,8±28,0 min.). Mean crossclamp time was 115,8±15,4 min. Intraoperative blood loss in all cases did not exceed 400 ml. Blood loss in the first postoperative day ranged from 50 to 300 ml (average 201,12±12,9 ml.). Mechanical ventilation on average lasted 4.5±0.5 hours after the intervention. All patients were transferred from the intensive care unit within 36±3.5 hours after surgery. The technique of correction of aortic valve defects in combination with aneurysm of the ascending aorta using minimally invasive access allows to minimize surgical trauma, provides a good cosmetic effect and can be used in clinical practice as an alternative to median sternotomy.  
Double Trisomy 48,XXY,+21 in a Neonate with Congenital Heart Disease.  ;Double trisomy 48, XXY, +21 or Down-Klinefelter syndrome is a rare occurrence and presents clinical manifestation of trisomy 21 in early life and of Klinefelter syndrome after 10 months of age. The phenotypic and karyotyping characteristics of a 2-month-old boy were reported. He had mild clinical feature of Down syndrome and echocardiographic features of atrioventricular (AV) septal defects with severe pulmonary valve stenosis.  
Stepwise mitral valve repair for Barlow's disease via a minimally invasive approach.  ;"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Mitral regurgitation (MR) in Barlow's disease is complicated because of its mixed pathophysiology, leaflet billowing with or without organic prolapse, and abnormal annular dynamics that cause functional prolapse. Complex repair techniques, including aggressive leaflet resection and implantation of multiple artificial chordae, are conventionally performed; nevertheless, these are technically demanding, especially when performed using a minimally invasive approach. We aimed to standardize the repair technique for Barlow's disease and developed stepwise repair techniques. METHODS: Of 292 patients who underwent isolated minimally invasive mitral valve repair for MR, 29 patients (seven females, age 49 ± 10 years) were found to have Barlow's disease. Our repair technique consists of the following three steps: (a) stabilization of the mitral annulus by placing annuloplasty ring sutures; (b) distinction between organic and functional prolapse by a saline injection test; and (c) targeted repair for organic prolapse by leaflet resection or chordal replacement. RESULTS: Surgical techniques included leaflet resection in 22 patients, chordal replacement in 19 patients, and ring annuloplasty only in one patient. These procedures were applied to the anterior leaflet in one, posterior leaflet in eight, and both leaflets in 19 patients. The median annuloplasty ring size was 34 mm. The repair success rate was 100%. No patients developed moderate or greater MR during a mean follow-up period of 36 ± 21 months. CONCLUSIONS: A stepwise repair strategy facilitates mitral valve repair in patients with Barlow's disease and provides excellent outcomes even via a minimally invasive approach.  "
The Course of Circulating Small Extracellular Vesicles in Patients Undergoing Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement.  ;In the last years, increasing efforts have been devoted to investigating the role of small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) in cardiovascular diseases. These nano-sized particles (30-150 nm), secreted by different cell types, contain signalling molecules that enable participation in intercellular communication processes. In this study, we examined the course of circulating sEVs in patients undergoing surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) and correlated them with echocardiographic and standard blood parameters. Peripheral blood samples were collected from 135 patients undergoing SAVR preoperatively and at three follow-up points. Circulating sEVs were precipitated using Exoquick™ exosome isolation reagent and analyzed by nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA). Our findings indicate that no more than 7 days after SAVR, there was a marked increase of circulating sEVs before returning to initial values after 3 months. Further, shear stress is not a trigger for the formation and release of circulating sEVs. Moreover, we pointed out a correlation between circulating sEVs and erythrocytes as well as LDH and creatinine levels in peripheral blood. Finally, all patients with a moderate prosthesis-patient mismatch as well as with an impaired left ventricular mass regression had lower levels of circulating sEVs 3 months after SAVR compared to their respective status before surgery. We conclude that in patients with aortic valve stenosis (AVS), sEVs may play an important part in mediating cell-cell communication and SAVR may have a crucial and lasting impact on their circulating levels. Besides, lower levels of sEVs portend to be associated with inferior recovery after major surgical interventions. The additional use of circulating sEVs beyond echocardiographic and laboratory parameters could have a prognostic value to estimate adverse outcomes in patients undergoing SAVR.  
Learning a new way of living together: a qualitative study exploring the relationship changes and intervention needs of patients with cardiovascular disease and their partners.  ;"OBJECTIVES: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) not only affects the patient, but has implications for the partner. Emerging evidence suggests that supportive couple relationships enhance CVD outcomes and reduce patient and partner distress. To date, however, little research has been done to address the couple relationship as a potentially important component of cardiac care. This article examines the impact of CVD on the couple relationship and assesses the perceived needs and desired intervention components of patients with CVD and their partners. DESIGN: Qualitative study using directed and conventional content analysis. SETTING: Single-centre, tertiary cardiac care hospital that serves a population of 1.4 million in the Champlain region of Ontario, Canada. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with CVD and their partners (n=32, 16 couples) participated in focus groups. Patients were mainly male (75%), white (87.5%), aged 64.4 years (range 31-81 years), with varied cardiac diagnoses (50% coronary artery disease; 18.75% valve disease; 18.75% heart failure; 12.5% arrhythmia). RESULTS: Five categories were generated from the data reflecting changes within the couple relationship as a result of CVD: (1) emotional and communication disconnection; (2) overprotection of the patient; (3) role changes; (4) adjustment to lifestyle changes; and (5) positive relationship changes. Three categories were constructed regarding intervention needs and desired resources: (1) practical resources; (2) sharing with peers; and (3) relationship enhancement. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the data suggest that there were profound changes in the couple relationship as a result of CVD, and that there is considerable need to better support the caregiving spouses and the couple as a unit. These results call for interventions designed to provide instrumental support, peer-sharing opportunities and relationship quality enhancement to help couples cope with CVD. Future studies should examine whether couples-based programming embedded into cardiac rehabilitation can be effective at improving relationship quality and reducing patient and partner stress in the aftermath of a cardiac event.

Hypo-attenuated leaflet thickening in surgically-implanted mitral bioprosthesis.  ;BACKGROUND: Hypo-attenuated leaflet thickening (HALT) in bioprosthetic aortic valve has been studied, but its equivalent in bioprosthetic mitral valve (bMV) remains uncharacterized. We sought to identify the prevalence, hemodynamic characteristics, and significance of anticoagulation therapy in bMV HALT. METHODS: A single-center cross-sectional study of 53 consecutive patients who underwent mitral valve replacement (MVR) with bMV between 2007 and 2017 was conducted. Cardiac-gated contrasted CT scans were obtained. Anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy use were ascertained at the time of hospital discharge and CT scanning. Patient characteristics, postoperative stroke, and hemodynamic profile by echocardiogram were obtained to descriptively characterize the prevalence and characteristics associated with bMV HALT. RESULTS: Three patients (5.7%) were found to have a HALT on bMV. The mean time from index MVR to CT scan was 3.4 ± 0.8 years in HALT cohort and 3.4 ± 2.7 years in non-HALT cohort. Fifty patients (94.3%) were discharged on warfarin, and 37 patients (69.8%) were on warfarin at the time of CT scans. One patient with HALT was on therapeutic warfarin at the time of the CT scan that identified HALT. All three patients were asymptomatic at the time of CT scan. In patients with HALT, mean transmitral pressure gradient were 8, 5, and 2.7 mmHg, all with trivial or mild mitral regurgitation. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the prevalence of HALT was low at 5.7%, all presenting without symptoms. One patient presented with HALT while on therapeutic oral anticoagulation, which may suggest thrombotic etiology may not adequately explain HALT.  
Applications of a Specialty Bicuspid Aortic Valve Program: Clinical Continuity and Translational Collaboration.  ;Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is a common congenital heart diagnosis and is associated with aortopathy. Current guidelines for aortic resection have been validated but are based on aortic diameter, which is insufficient to predict acute aortic events. Clinical and translational collaboration is necessary to identify biomarkers that can individualize the timing of prophylactic surgery for BAV aortopathy. We describe our multidisciplinary BAV program, including research protocols aimed at biomarker discovery and results from our longitudinal clinical registry. From 2012-2018, 887 patients enrolled in our clinical BAV registry with the option to undergo four dimensional flow cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (4D flow CMR) and donate serum plasma or tissue samples. Of 887 patients, 388 (44%) had an elective BAV-related procedure after initial presentation, while 499 (56%) continued with medical management. Of medical patients, 44 (9%) had elective surgery after 2.3 ± 1.4 years. Surgery patients' biobank donations include 198 (46%) aorta, 374 (86%) aortic valve, and 314 (73%) plasma samples. The 4D flow CMR was completed for 215 (50%) surgery patients and 243 (49%) medical patients. Patients with BAV aortopathy can be safely followed by a multidisciplinary team to detect indications for surgery. Paired tissue and hemodynamic analysis holds opportunity for biomarker development in BAV aortopathy.  
Functional Role of Natriuretic Peptides in Risk Assessment and Prognosis of Patients with Mitral Regurgitation.  ;The management of mitral valve regurgitation (MR), a common valve disease, represents a challenge in clinical practice, since the indication for either surgical or percutaneous valve replacement or repair are guided by symptoms and by echocardiographic parameters which are not always feasible. In this complex scenario, the use of natriuretic peptide (NP) levels would serve as an additive diagnostic and prognostic tool. These biomarkers contribute to monitoring the progression of the valve disease, even before the development of hemodynamic consequences in a preclinical stage of myocardial damage. They may contribute to more accurate risk stratification by identifying patients who are more likely to experience death from cardiovascular causes, heart failure, and cardiac hospitalizations, thus requiring surgical management rather than a conservative approach. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the available evidence on the role of NPs in the management, risk evaluation, and prognostic assessment of patients with MR both before and after surgical or percutaneous valve repair. Despite largely positive evidence, a series of controversial findings exist on this relevant topic. Recent clinical trials failed to assess the role of NPs following the interventional procedure. Future larger studies are required to enable the introduction of NP levels into the guidelines for the management of MR.  
Five-year outcomes following complex reconstructive surgery for infective endocarditis involving the intervalvular fibrous body.  ;"OBJECTIVES: Destruction of the intervalvular fibrous body (IFB) due to infective endocarditis (IE) warrants a complex operation involving radical debridement of all infected tissue, followed by double valve replacement (aortic and mitral valve replacement) with patch reconstruction of the IFB. This study assesses the 5-year outcomes in patients undergoing this complex procedure for treatment of double valve IE with IFB involvement. METHODS: A total of 127 consecutive patients underwent double valve replacement with reconstruction of the IFB for active complex IE between January 1999 and December 2018. Primary outcomes were 3-year and 5-year survival, as well as 5-year freedom from reoperation. RESULTS: Patients' mean age was 65.3 ± 12.9 years. Preoperative cardiogenic shock and sepsis were present in 17.3% and 18.9%, respectively. The majority of patients (81.3%) had undergone previous cardiac surgery. Overall, 30-day and 90-day mortality rates were 28.3% and 37.0%, respectively. The 3- and 5-year survival rates for all patients were 45.3 ± 5.1% and 41.8 ± 5.8%, and for those who survived the first 90 postoperative days 75.8 ± 6.1% and 70.0 ± 8.0%, respectively. The overall 5-year freedom from reoperation was 85.1 ± 5.7%. Preoperative predictors for 30-day mortality were Staphylococcus aureus [odds ratio (OR) 1.65; P = 0.04] and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <35% (OR 12.06; P = 0.03), for 90-day mortality acute kidney injury requiring dialysis (OR 6.2; P = 0.02) and LVEF <35% (OR 9.66; P = 0.03) and for long-term mortality cardiogenic shock (hazard ratio 2.46; P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Double valve replacement with reconstruction of the IFB in patients with complex IE is a challenging operation associated with high morbidity and mortality, particularly in the first 90 days after surgery. Survival and freedom from reoperation rates are acceptable thereafter, particularly considering the severity of disease and complex surgery.  "
Reference intervals and echocardiographic findings in Leonberger dogs.  ;INTRODUCTION: Leonbergers are large-breed dogs believed to be predisposed to dilated cardiomyopathy, yet the normal echocardiographic measurements of these dogs are unknown. The aim of this study was to describe echocardiographic findings and propose breed-specific reference intervals (RIs) for Leonbergers. ANIMALS: A total of 42 clinically healthy dogs were involved in this study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was designed as a cross-sectional study of 42 Leonberger dogs undergoing complete transthoracic echocardiographic studies at a national show. Reference intervals were determined using robust method with bootstrapping. The effects of age, sex, and body weight (BW) on linear and volumetric dimensions were evaluated by regression analysis. Intra- and interobserver variability were evaluated by coefficient of variation from 10 of the studies. RESULTS: There were significant linear correlations with BW for many of the cardiac variables evaluated. However, despite the statistical significance, most regression equations had small slopes, necessitating large changes in BW for small changes in two-dimensional echocardiographic variables. As such, this study resulted in breed-specific RIs irrespective of BW. Trace mitral insufficiency (n = 18), trace aortic insufficiency (n = 15), or both (n = 1) was identified in 81% of dogs in this population. Coefficients of variation were <9% for all two-dimensional, volumetric, and motion mode measurements. CONCLUSIONS: This study describes echocardiographic findings and provides RIs, which may be useful in echocardiographic evaluations of Leonbergers and may aid in early identification of heart disease within the breed.

State-of-the art bicuspid aortic valve repair in 2020.  ;Patients with a bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) frequently require surgical intervention for aortic regurgitation (AR) and/or aneurysm. Valve-preserving surgery and repair of regurgitant BAVs have evolved into an increasingly used alternative to replacement. Anatomic predictors of possible repair failures have been identified and solutions developed. Using current techniques most non-calcified BAVs can be preserved or repaired. Excellent repair durability and freedom from valve-related complications can be achieved if all pathologic components of aortic valve and root including annular dilatation are corrected. Anatomic variations must be addressed using tailored approaches.  
Transcatheter Tricuspid and Pulmonary Valve Repair and Replacement.  ;Severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is associated with significant mortality and morbidities. Currently, surgical tricuspid repair with annuloplasty is the gold standard treatment. However, the prohibitive risks of open surgery and increasing evidence that severe TR should be intervened on early has led to an outburst in the development and evolution of transcatheter tricuspid valve interventions (TTVI). These technologies are broadly categorized into direct suture annuloplasty devices, minimally invasive annuloplasty, direct ring annuloplasty devices, coaptation-based strategies, edge-to-edge repair devices, and transcatheter valve replacement. Each has its own set of advantages and limitations and have been tried, to varying degrees of success, in a myriad of pathoanatomic scenarios. Challenges faced in TTVI device and trial designs include heterogeneous patient populations, the need for quality imaging, variations of imaging requirements and anatomic criteria by device, hard-to-define clinical endpoints, and the poor prognosis carried by significant residual TR. Similar to tricuspid valve disease, pulmonic valve (PV) disease can occur on its own or secondary to a congenital heart defect, most commonly tetralogy of Fallot. Many patients with pulmonic stenosis or insufficiency often require repeat surgical interventions for other cardiac problems, highlighting the importance of developing transcatheter approaches to reduce the number of repeat open-heart surgeries required. Transcatheter PV replacement (TPVR) is growing in use and is the procedure of choice in patients with failed bioprostheses via valve-in-valve implantation. The Melody (Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis, Minnesota) and SAPIEN XT (Edwards Lifesciences Inc., Irvine, California) devices are the currently available TPVR technologies. Current limitations here include device kinking, the risk of stent fracture, anatomic difficulties, such as asymmetric right ventricular outflow tracts leading to poor landing zones and procedural risks of coronary artery and aortic root compression.  
Illness Perception After Heart Valve Surgery: Differences Among Men and Women.  ;"BACKGROUND: Illness perception is composed of thoughts, ideas, and beliefs about illness, and a negative illness perception is known to be associated with poor outcomes. Among men and women, clinical outcomes after heart valve surgery are known to differ, but knowledge about differences in illness perception is sparse. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to describe the differences in illness perception among men and women after open heart valve surgery and to identify sociodemographic and clinical characteristics associated with worse illness perception in men and women. METHODS: In a national cross-sectional study combined with register-based clinical and sociodemographic information, data on illness perception were collected with the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire. Worse illness perception was defined as the worst quartile of each item of the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire. Multiple logistic regression analyses were conducted to explore characteristics associated with worse illness perception. RESULTS: Of 1084 eligible patients, 32% (n = 349) completed the questionnaire (67% men; mean age, 68 years). Compared with men, women reported significantly worse scores of illness perception in 6 of 8 items. Furthermore, being female, age, length of stay, and comorbidity were associated with worse illness perception (worse quartile of scores). Age, higher educational level, and comorbidity were found to be associated with worse illness perception for men and length of stay for women. CONCLUSION: After open heart valve surgery, illness perception differs among men and women, with women having worse illness perception. Among the total population, being female, age, a longer length of stay, and comorbidity were also associated with worse illness perception.  "
The Spectrum of Pregnancy-Associated Heart Failure Phenotypes: An Echocardiographic Study.  ;"Compare echocardiographic phenotypes of women presenting with peripartum heart failure. A retrospective case-control study of pregnant women (n = 86) presenting with PP-HF symptoms (i.e., dyspnea, PND, orthopnea) and objective examination and laboratory findings (lung congestion, elevated JVP and/or HJR, elevated brain natriuretic peptide [BNP] and pulmonary edema on chest X-ray). Three distinct phenotypes based on echocardiographically-defined LVEF were identified: (a) PP-HF with preserved ejection fraction (PP HFpEF, LVEF: > 50%); (b) PP-HF with midrange ejection fraction (PP HFmrEF, LVEF: 40-50%); c) PP-HF with reduced ejection fraction (PP HFrEF, LVEF: < 40%); these were compared with 17 pregnant subjects without PP-HF symptoms/findings. Most patients were African American (n = 63; 73%), with low prevalence of hypertension (n = 15, 17%) or diabetes mellitus (n = 5, 5%); pre-eclampsia was highly prevalent (n = 52, 60%). Echocardiographically-defined phenotypes (HFpEF, n = 37; HFmrEF, n = 18; HFrEF, n = 31) showed progressively worse abnormalities in LV remodeling (LV enlargement, LV hypertrophy), LV diastolic function, and right ventricular function; the three PP-HF groups had comparable abnormalities in increased left atrial size and estimated peak tricuspid valve regurgitation velocity. Compared to controls, all three groups had significantly increased filling pressures, LV mass index and left atrial volume index. Peripartum women presenting with the clinical syndrome of heart failure exhibit a spectrum of echocardiographic phenotypes. Significant abnormalities in LV structure, diastolic function, LA size, peak TR velocity and RV function were identified in women with preserved and mid-range EFs, suggesting pregnancy-related cardiac pathophysiologic derangements.

Comparison of Different Anticoagulation Regimens Regarding Maternal and Fetal Outcomes in Pregnant Patients With Mechanical Prosthetic Heart Valves (from the Multicenter ANATOLIA-PREG Registry).  ;"Mechanical prosthetic heart valves (MPHVs) are highly thrombogenic, and a pregnancy-induced procoagulant status increases the risk of MPHV thrombosis. Despite numerous case reports, 2 major registries and meta-analyses/systematic reviews, optimal anticoagulation therapy during pregnancy remains controversial. The goal of this study was to evaluate different anticoagulation regimens in pregnant patients with MPHVs. The outcomes of anticoagulation regimens were assessed retrospectively in pregnant women (110 women; 155 pregnancies) with MPHVs. The study population was divided into 5 groups according to anticoagulation regimens used; high-dose warfarin (>5 mg/d) throughout pregnancy (group 1), low-dose warfarin (≤5 mg/d) throughout pregnancy (group 2), low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) throughout pregnancy (group 3), first trimester LMWH, 2nd and 3rd trimester warfarin (group 4), first 2 trimester LMWH, and 3rd trimester warfarin (group 5). Of 155 pregnancies, 55 (35%) resulted in fetal loss; whereas 41 (27%) cases with abortion (miscarriage and therapeutic) and 14 (9%) stillbirths occurred. The comparison of the groups showed that the whole abortion rates including therapeutic abortion were significantly higher in Group 1, and lower in groups 3 and 5 (p <0.001). However, miscarriage rates were similar between the groups. A total of 53 pregnancies (34%) suffered from prosthetic valves thrombosis (PVT) during pregnancy or in the postpartum period. Group 2 had significantly lower rates of PVT than the other groups (p <0.001). In conclusion, the current data suggests that there is no optimal therapy, and that all managements have advantages and disadvantages. Low-dose warfarin (≤5 mg/day) regimen with therapeutic international normalized ratio levels may provide effective maternal protection throughout pregnancy with acceptable fetal outcomes.  "
Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy and Sudden Death Initially Identified at Autopsy.  ;Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HC) is associated with a well-recognized risk for unexpected sudden death (SD). Most such reported patients have been referred to dedicated centers and/or expert cardiologists for risk stratification, with the number of SDs decreasing sharply due to penetration of the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICDs) into HC practice. However, the clinical circumstances, and morphologic features of HC patients who incur SD without the opportunity to be considered for preventive intervention with ICDs are largely undefined. Using the long-standing unique Jesse Edwards Registry (St. Paul, Minnesota), we studied 86 selected heart specimens from young HC patients who died suddenly and unexpectedly without prior clinical evaluation, ages 31 ± 16 years. The patients were predominantly male (87%) with only modest phenotypic expression and maximum LV wall thickening of only 18 ± 4 mm. SD events occurred predominantly with sedentary/mild activities (66%) often in bed or asleep (32%), but also during physical activity (22%) including with organized competitive sports. This largely unappreciated sub-population of patients with HC (and SD) is characterized by mild-to-moderate degree of LV hypertrophy, representing a clinical challenge which is particularly relevant in the current ICD era for HC, with the potential for SD prevention.  
Rapidly vanishing left atrial dissection following mitral valve replacement: a case report.  ;"BACKGROUND: Left atrial dissection is an extremely rare complication of mitral valve replacement. Because of its severity, its prompt diagnosis and treatment is mandatory. The most effective treatment (i.e. surgical vs. non-surgical) for left atrial dissection has not been fully established yet. CASE PRESENTATION: Herein, we have reported left atrial dissection after mitral valve replacement in a 68-year-old obese woman. After closing the thorax, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) revealed an atrial mass of 3 cm × 2 cm, visualized as an oval hypoechoic appearance extending from the posterior annulus of the mitral valve to the posterior wall of the left atrium. Because hemodynamic conditions were stable, surgery was ruled out and conservative treatment with close observation was selected. On postoperative day 2, TEE revealed that the atrial mass had vanished and the broken piece of the endocardium merely remained fluttering in the atrium. On postoperative day 6, the appearance of the left atrium was normalized completely, leaving no traces of left atrial dissection. The patient recovered uneventfully. Serial TEE was a very effective imaging modality during the non-surgical treatment of left atrial dissection. CONCLUSIONS: It is crucial to accurately define diagnosis and optimally consider therapeutic strategies for left atrial dissection based on the hemodynamic conditions of the patient and serial TEE follow-up examinations. In our case study, left atrial dissection was successfully treated with conservative treatment; therefore, we believe that TEE could be a feasible modality for the early diagnosis of this condition.

Concurrent pathogenic variants in SLC6A1/NOTCH1/PRIMPOL genes in a Chinese patient with myoclonic-atonic epilepsy, mild aortic valve stenosis and high myopia.  ;BACKGROUND: Pathogenic SLC6A1 variants have been reported in patients with myoclonic-atonic epilepsy (MAE). NOTCH1, encoding a member of the Notch family of proteins, is known to be associated with aortic valve disease. The PRIMPOL variant has only been identified in Chinese patients with high myopia. Exome sequencing analysis now allows the simultaneous detection of multiple genetic etiologies for patients with complicated clinical features. However, the presence of three Mendelian disorders in one patient supported by their respective pathogenic variants and clinical phenotypes is very rare. CASE PRESENTATION: Here, we report a 4-year-old Chinese boy who presented with MAE, delayed language, borderline intellectual disability (ID), mildly impaired social skills and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). He also had mild aortic valve stenosis and high myopia. Using whole-exome sequencing (WES), we identified three variants: (1) SLC6A1, NM_003042.4: c.881-883del (p.Phe294del), (2) NOTCH1, NM_017617.5:c.1100-2A > G and (3) PRIMPOL, NM_152683.4:c.265 T > G (p.Tyr89Asp). Parental Sanger sequencing confirmed that SLC6A1 and NOTCH1 variants were de novo, whereas the PRIMPOL variant was inherited from the father who also had high myopia. Furthermore, the PRIMPOL variant was absent from the genomes of the paternal grandparents, and thus was also a de novo event in the family. All three variants are classified as pathogenic. CONCLUSION: The SLC6A1 variant could explain the features of MAE, delayed language, borderline ID, impaired social skills and ADHD in this patient, whereas the features of aortic valve stenosis and high myopia of the patient may be explained by variants in NOTCH1 and PRIMPOL, respectively. This case demonstrated the utility of exome sequencing in uncovering the multiple pathogenic variants in a patient with complicated phenotypes due to the blending of three Mendelian disorders.  
[Papillary fibroelastoma in the cardiologist's practice].  ;The article presents a clinical case of diagnosis and treatment of a rare disease, multiple papillary fibroelastoma associated with a relapse and a complication in the form of cardioembolic stroke. The authors stressed difficulties in diagnostics of this disease and a special role of the physician-patient interaction.  
[LEOPARD syndrome].  ;LEOPARD syndrome with multiple lentigines (cardiomyopathic lentiginosis) is a rare, genetically predetermined disease with autosomal dominant inheritance. Prevalence of this syndrome is unknown. One of pathognomonic clinical manifestations of this syndrome is the presence of multiple lentiginous pigment spots all over the body. The most common cardiac manifestation (approximately 80%) is myocardial hypertrophy. We presented a rare clinical case of detecting LEOPARD syndrome with multiple lentigines in a 32-year old female patient with major manifestations evident as pronounces morpho-functional alterations, myocardial hypertrophy, and heart rhythm disorders.  
[Clinical significance of different assesment methods of myocardial fibrosis in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.].  ;"Objective To evaluate prospects for clinical use of circulating biomarkers for characterizing fibrotic changes in the myocardium of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCMP) with left ventricular (LV) outflow tract obstruction.Materials and Methods This was a prospective study with a 12-month follow-up period. The study included 47 patients (29 females and 18 males) with obstructive HCMP who were selected for septal reduction. Echocardiography (EchoCG), cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and measurements of serum C-reactive protein, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, and relevant circulating markers of fibrosis (TGF-β1, MMP-2,-9, TIMP-1, galectin-3, sST2, CITP, PICP, and PIIINP) were performed for all patients. All patients were evaluated at baseline and at 7 days, 6 and 12 months following surgical treatment. Morphometrical analysis of intraoperative biopsy samples was performed for evaluation of the degree of fibrotic changes. Patients received beta-blockers (95.7%), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (34%), loop diuretics (68.1%), aldosterone antagonists (34%), and statins (66%).Results Women with HCMP were older and more frequently had additional risk factors (arterial hypertension). Men had a higher risk of sudden cardiac death. Histological study of intraoperative myocardial biopsy samples showed that the area of fibrotic changes was 13.9±6.9%. According to cardiac MRI mean area of delayed contrast enhancement was 8.7±3.3% of LV myocardial mass. No association was established between traditional cardiovascular risk factors and severity of myocardial fibrotic changes or levels of circulating fibrosis markers. Perhaps that was due to the modifying effect of the drug therapy received by HCMP patients. According to EchoCG maximum pressure gradient in the LV outflow tract before the surgical treatment was 88 (55; 192) mm Hg, and interventricular septal thickness was 22 (16; 32) mm. A considerable decrease (p=0.0002) in the LV outflow tract gradient was observed after myectomy in all patients. At the same time, the left ventricular dimension, which tended to decrease in the early postoperative period, returned to baseline values by the 6th month of follow-up.Conclusion The study confirmed the increase in relevant circulating markers of fibrosis in patients with obstructive HCMP. At the same time, no correlation was observed between levels of circulating biomarkers and severity of fibrosis according to data of histology and cardiac MRI, which was probably due to the modifying effect of drug therapy and limited sampling.

(18)F-Sodium Fluoride ((18)F-NaF) for Imaging Microcalcification Activity in the Cardiovascular System.  ;Accumulating preclinical and clinical evidence suggests that calcification is one of the body's primary responses to injury and a key pathological feature of cardiovascular disease. Calcification activity can now be imaged using 18F-sodium fluoride (18F-NaF) positron emission tomography (PET) in combination with either computed tomography or magnetic resonance. These techniques allow visualization of calcification activity and, therefore, provide different information to the established macroscopic calcium imaged with computed tomography. Indeed, 18F-NaF PET has been used to investigate a wide range of valvular conditions, including aortic stenosis, mitral annular calcification, and bioprosthetic valve disease, as well as vascular conditions, including abdominal aortic aneurysm disease, coronary, and carotid atherosclerosis, peripheral vascular disease, and erectile dysfunction. In this brief review, we will focus on how 18F-NaF PET has improved our pathophysiological understanding of cardiovascular calcification and how it can be used as a marker of vascular calcification, providing a useful tool that can be utilized in clinical trials investigating the prediction of both disease progression and clinical events. Finally, we will discuss how 18F-NaF might be employed clinically to improve patient assessment and to guide decision-making.  
Long-Term Survival Following Surgical Ablation for Atrial Fibrillation Concomitant to Isolated and Combined Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery-Analysis from the Polish National Registry of Cardiac Surgery Procedures (KROK).  ;"The current investigation aimed to evaluate long-term survival in patients undergoing isolated and combined coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with concomitant surgical ablation for atrial fibrillation (AF). Procedural data from KROK (Polish National Registry of Cardiac Surgery Procedures) were retrospectively collected. Eleven thousand three hundred sixteen patients with baseline AF (72.4% men, mean age 69.6 ± 7.9) undergoing isolated and combined CABG surgery between 2006-2019 in 37 reference centers across Poland and included in the registry were analyzed. The median follow-up was four years (3.7 IQR 1.3-6.8). Over a 12-year study period, there was a significant survival benefit (Hazard Ratio (HR) 0.83; (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.73-0.95); p = 0.005) with concomitant ablation as compared to no concomitant ablation. After rigorous propensity matching (LOGIT model, 432 pairs), concomitant surgical ablation was associated with over 25% improved survival in the overall analysis: HR 0.74; (95% CIs: 0.56-0.98); p = 0.036. The benefit of concomitant ablation was maintained in the subgroups, yet the most benefit was appraised in low-risk patients (EuroSCORE < 2, p = 0.003) with the three-vessel disease (p < 0.001) and without other comorbidities. Ablation was further associated with significantly improved survival in patients undergoing CABG with mitral valve surgery (HR 0.62; (95% CIs: 0.52-0.74); p < 0.001) and in patients in whom complete revascularization was not achieved: HR 0.43; (95% CIs: 0.24-0.79); p = 0.006.

In-hospital outcomes of percutaneous mitral valve repair in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: insights from the national inpatient sample database.  ;"OBJECTIVES: We aimed to assess the in-hospital outcomes in patients with mitral regurgitation treated with percutaneous mitral valve repair (PMVR) among patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). BACKGROUND: There is lack of data on the outcomes of PMVR for mitral regurgitation in patients with COPD. METHODS: We analyzed the national inpatient sample (NIS) database from January 2012 to December 2016. RESULTS: A total of 9125 patients underwent PMVR in the period between January 2012 and December 2016, of whom 2,495 (27.3%) patients had concomitant COPD. Comparing COPD patients to non-COPD patients, COPD patients had higher proportion of females (48.3% vs. 46.6%, p = .16), were younger (75.8 ± 10.0 years vs. 76.4 ± 12.2 years; p = .04), had higher prevalence of peripheral vascular disease (17.4% vs. 13.5%; p < .01) and renal failure (39.3% vs. 37%; p < .01). After propensity matching, there was no significant difference in mortality among the COPD group versus non-COPD patients (2.6% vs. 2.9%; p = .6). Patients with COPD had higher proportion of in-hospital morbidities including St-segment elevation myocardial infarction (1.8% vs. 1.0%; p = .02), cardiogenic shock (1.4% vs. 0.4%; p < .01), vascular complications (2% vs. 0.8; p < .01), pneumothorax (1% vs. 0.4%; p < .01), and septic shock (1.2% vs. 0.4%; p < .01). Moreover, surrogates of severe disability (mechanical intubation and non-home discharges), cost of hospitalization, and length of stay were higher in the COPD group. CONCLUSIONS: There was no difference in mortality between the COPD and non-COPD patients after PMVR. Moreover, we observed higher rates of in-hospital morbidities, surrogates of severe disability, and higher resources utilization by the COPD group.  "
Acute fulminant hemolysis after transcatheter mitral valve replacement for mitral annular calcification.  ;"Transcatheter mitral valve replacement (TMVR) is emerging as an alternative treatment strategy to surgery for patients with severe mitral annular calcification (MAC) who are not candidates for traditional mitral valve surgery. Paravalvular leak (PVL) is common following TMVR for severe MAC and can lead to heart failure symptoms and/or intravascular hemolysis, the latter of which usually is clinically stable. We report the case of a 67-year-old woman with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis and mitral stenosis with MAC in the setting of prior chest irradiation who was treated initially with transcatheter aortic valve replacement followed by TMVR at a later date (Sapien S3 system; Edwards Lifesciences). Immediately following TMVR, she developed acute profound hemolysis which manifested with hemoglobinuria, transfusion-dependent anemia, and acute renal failure requiring renal replacement therapy. She was treated with post-dilation balloon valvuloplasty after failed transcatheter PVL closure 10 days following TMVR with resulting improvement in the PVL. The hemolytic anemia resolved and renal function recovered without the need for continued hemodialysis 2 months later and stabilization of glomerular filtration rate at 6 months. This case highlights a potential severe complication of TMVR in MAC and suggests that improvement in hemolysis and late recovery of renal function may occur following treatment of PVL.  "
New Insights into Valve Hemodynamics.  ;"Heart valve diseases are common disorders with five million annual diagnoses being made in the United States alone. All heart valve disorders alter cardiac hemodynamic performance; therefore, treatments aim to restore normal flow. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art clinical and engineering advancements in heart valve treatments with a focus on hemodynamics. We review engineering studies and clinical literature on the experience with devices for aortic valve treatment, as well as the latest advancements in mitral valve treatments and the pulmonic and tricuspid valves on the right side of the heart. Upcoming innovations will potentially revolutionize treatment of heart valve disorders. These advancements, and more gradual enhancements in the procedural techniques and imaging modalities, could improve the quality of life of patients suffering from valvular disease who currently cannot be treated.

Intra-cardiac aspergilloma in a normally structured heart: A case report.  ;Fungal endocarditis is a relatively rare condition which mostly complicates those with intra-cardiac devices and those whose immune system is compromised. Here we present a 63-year-old diabetic man with two-weeks history of weakness and fatigue plus low-grade fever. Transesophageal echocardiography showed a mobile mass attached to the left coronary cusp of the aortic valve which protruded into the left ventricular (LV) outflow tract. Cardiac magnetic resonance further confirmed the presence of a large broad base 18 × 20 × 18 mm mass without gadolinium enhancement suggestive for fungal infection. Voriconazole was administered on the same day after which distal embolization of the mass to distal abdominal aorta ensued shortly. Echocardiography documented the disappearance of the mass from LV outflow tract. Vascular surgeon removed the mass from abdominal aorta immediately and pathology revealed the aspergilloma which was later confirmed by culture. After embolization the patient had become unstable and signs of septic shock occurred which ultimately led to his death in 72 h. Presence of Aspergillus infection in apparently normal cardiac chambers without presence of any intra-cardiac device is extremely rare and the presented case study reports such a scenario. Rapid initiation of anti-fungal agents and early surgery are of paramount importance in patient survival. <Learning objective: Cardiac aspergillosis is a rare condition and delayed diagnosis and treatment can be fatal. Cardiac imaging though helps differentiate the intra cardiac mass etiology, must not hinder early surgical removal especially when the location of the mass is critical.>.  
Preventive effect of low-dose landiolol on postoperative atrial fibrillation study (PELTA study).  ;"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy of prophylactic administration of low-dose landiolol on postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) in patients after cardiovascular surgery. METHODS: Consecutive 150 patients over 70 years of age who underwent cardiovascular surgery for valvular, ischemic heart, and aortic diseases were enrolled in this single-center prospective randomized control study from 2010 to 2014. They were assigned to three treatment groups: 1γ group (landiolol at 1 μg/kg/min), 2γ group (landiolol at 2 μg/kg/min), or control group (no landiolol). In the two landiolol groups, landiolol hydrochloride was intravenously administered for a period of 4 days postoperatively. Electrocardiography was continuously monitored during the study period, and cardiologists eventually assessed whether POAF occurred or not. RESULTS: POAF occurred in 24.4% of patients in the control group, 18.2% in 1γ group, and 11.1% in 2γ group (p = 0.256). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the incidence of POAF tended to decrease depending on the dose of landiolol (trend-p = 0.120; 1γ group: OR = 0.786, 95% CI 0.257-2.404; 2γ group: OR = 0.379, 95% CI 0.112-1.287). Subgroup analysis showed a significant dose-dependent reduction in POAF among categories of female sex, non-use of angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) before surgery, and valve surgery (each trend-p = 0.02, 0.03, and 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that prophylactic administration of low-dose landiolol may not be effective for preventing the occurrence of POAF in overall patients after cardiovascular surgery, but the administration could be beneficial to female patients, patients not using ARBs preoperatively, and those after valvular surgery.

Understanding tricuspid valve remodelling in atrial fibrillation using three-dimensional echocardiography.  ;"AIMS: Atrial fibrillation (AF) has been associated with tricuspid annulus (TA) dilation in patients with severe functional tricuspid regurgitation (TR); however, the impact of AF is less clear in patients without severe TR. Our aim was to characterize TA remodelling in patients with AF in the absence of severe TR using 3D transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE). METHODS AND RESULTS: Ninety patients underwent clinically indicated transthoracic and TOE: non-structural (NS)-AF (n = 30); AF with left heart disease (LHD) (n = 30), and controls in sinus rhythm (n = 30). Three-dimensional TOE datasets were analysed to measure TA dimensions using novel dedicated tricuspid valve software. The NS-AF group showed biatrial dilatation and normal right ventricular (RV) size with decreased longitudinal function compared to controls, whereas the LHD-AF group showed biatrial dilatation, RV enlargement, decreased biventricular function, and higher systolic pulmonary artery pressure compared with the other groups. Indexed TA area, minimum diameter, maximum diameter, and total perimeter were significantly larger in the NS-AF group than in controls (measurements in end-diastole: 6.4 ± 1.1 vs. 5.0 ± 0.6 cm2/m2, 1.8 ± 0.3 vs. 1.6 ± 0.2 cm/m2, 2.1 ± 0.3 vs. 1.9 ± 0.2 cm/m2, and 6.6 ± 0.9 vs. 5.9 ± 0.7 cm/m2, respectively, all P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in any indexed TA parameter between AF groups. TA circularity index (ratio between minimum and maximal diameters) and TA fractional area change between end-diastole and end-systole were no different among the three groups. CONCLUSION: AF is associated with right atrial and tricuspid annular remodelling independent of the presence of LHD in patients with intrinsically normal tricuspid leaflets without severe TR.  "
Timing of peptide receptor radiotargeted therapy in relation to cardiac valve surgery for carcinoid heart disease in patients with neuroendocrine metastases and cardiac syndrome. A single-centre study from a centre of excellence.  ;"INTRODUCTION: Perioperative mortality of patients who undergo heart valve surgery for carcinoid heart valve disease has been observed to be high (5%-10%). We investigated whether peptide receptor radiotherapy with lutetium-177 dotatate can be used safely in patients with neuroendocrine neoplasm carcinoid heart valve disease and if there is associated survival advantage by reducing overall exposure of the valves to high doses of vasoactive peptides. METHOD: Retrospective case notes review was performed on 18 neuroendocrine neoplasm patients (mean 60 years), who underwent heart valve surgery between 2003 and 2017 for carcinoid heart valve disease, 9 of whom received peptide receptor radiotherapy in addition to surgery. RESULTS: All patients were treated with somatostatin receptor antagonists and underwent cardiac valvular surgery (mean two valves replaced) and three benefitted from additional coronary bypass grafting. Nine patients underwent surgery alone: in this group, the time from surgery to progression was 14 months (mean; SD 13.5 months). Nine were treated with peptide receptor radiotherapy in addition to surgery. Six underwent surgery with peptide receptor radiotherapy on progression. Time to progression from surgery to first peptide receptor radiotherapy was mean 25.1 months (SD 23.6 months). No patients developed peritreatment cardiac complications. There were no deaths within the 30-day postoperative period. Average time from surgery to last follow-up/death was 41 months (6-79) in the surgery + lutetium group and in the surgery only group 17 months (1-24). Nine patients died, five in the surgery + lutetium group and four in the surgery only group, all at greater than 1-year postsurgery. DISCUSSION: Peptide receptor radiotherapy is safe in the setting of Carcinoid valvular heart disease in patients with controlled heart failure, PPRT can be use in the pre- and post-valve surgery period. There appears to be a survival benefit of having peptide receptor radiotherapy. Further evidence for peptide receptor radiotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting prior to cardiothoracic surgery is required.  "
Congenital heart disease in adults (when kids grow up) pediatric geriatric anesthesia.  ;PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The current review focuses on the new development of adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) patients in the areas of imaging, percutaneous interventions, ventricular assist devices and transplantation. RECENT FINDINGS: Since the last ACHD publication in the journal, several advances have been made in the evaluation and treatment of these patients. As CHD patients' longevity increases pregnancy, comorbities and acquired heart disease become a concern. Recent data show that the incidence of complications in low-risk CHD is not higher that the regular population. In addition, breakthrough research in percutaneous valve implantation has been published showing good outcomes but needing intensive care recovery in a significant number of patients. In the ACHD heart failure population, assist device and transplant fields mounting evidence shows that these therapies should not be the last resort since low-risk ACHD patient may have similar outcomes to those with acquired heart disease. Finally risk stratification is important in ACHD to define better ways to recover from surgery and anesthesia. SUMMARY: The field of anesthesia for ACHD is growing with new indications for diagnostic, interventional and surgical procedures. Tailoring cardiac and noncardiac care to the different risk profile in ACHD patients will be defined in the next few years. VIDEO ABSTRACT: Motta summary clip: http://links.lww.com/COAN/A65.  
Role of psychiatric, cardiovascular, socioeconomic, and demographic risk factors on idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus: A retrospective case-control study.  ;"OBJECTIVES: Currently, predicting and preventing idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) remains challenging, especially for patients without a history of cerebrovascular disease. By exploring the role of cardiovascular and psychiatric history, demographics, and socioeconomic status in iNPH, will provide better direction for elucidating the etiology or addressing healthcare inequalities. PATIENTS AND METHODS: To investigate iNPH with respect to the selected risk factors, we conducted a retrospective case-control study from a neuroscience institute in Hawaii with a patient pool of 25,843. After excluding patients with a history of cerebrovascular disease, we identified 29 cases which meet the American-European guidelines for iNPH diagnosis. Meanwhile, 116 controls matched to age, sex, and race were also randomly selected. RESULTS: Median age at diagnosis was 83 (IQR: 74-88), with cases estimated 22 years older than controls (95 % CI: 14.00-29.00; p = 0.0000001). Patients with iNPH were more likely to be White (OR 4.01, 95 % CI: 1.59-10.11; p = 0.0042) and less likely Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander (OR 0.010, 95 % CI: 0.00-0.78; p = 0.014). Median household income was $2874 (95 % CI: 0.000089-6905; p = 0.088) greater amongst iNPH cases. Effect size amongst cardiovascular risk factors was not found statistically significant (i.e., body mass index, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease or prior myocardial infarction history, peripheral vascular disease, smoking status, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation/flutter, and history of prosthetic valve replacement). However, iNPH patients were more likely to have a history of alcohol use disorder (OR 8.29, 95 % CI: 0.99-453.87; p = 0.050) and history of a psychiatric disorder (OR 2.48; 95 % CI: 1.08-5.68; p = 0.029). Odds ratio for autoimmune disorder, thyroid disorder, glaucoma, and seizures did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSION: Patient race (i.e., White; Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander) was found associated with iNPH development. Meanwhile, after excluding those with cerebrovascular disease, cardiovascular risk factors were not found associated with iNPH. Lastly, iNPH cases were more inclined to have a history of alcohol use disorder and prior psychiatric disorder. Overall, this data reveals that a racial disparity exists amongst iNPH, as well as highlights the role of various cardiovascular and psychiatric risk factors, which can potentially provide direction in etiology elucidation.

[Long-term outcome of patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy post percutaneous transluminal septal ablation].  ;Objective: To evaluate the long-term outcome of patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy(HOCM) after percutaneous transluminal septal ablation(PTSMA). Methods: HOCM patients who underwent PTSMA and surgical myectomy at the Chest Hospital of Shanghai Jiao Tong University from April 2001 to February 2019 were included in this retrospective analysis. Patients were divided into PTSMA group and surgical myectomy group. In addition, patients undergoing PTSMA were further divided into HOCM-PTSMA non-survivor group and HOCM-PTSMA survivor group. The general clinical information, procedural/surgical information and complications during hospitalization were compared between groups. Multivariate Cox regression model was used to analyze the independent risk factors for all-cause death in HOCM patients after PTSMA. Results: A total of 104 patients with HOCM who underwent PTSMA were enrolled. Mean age of the patients was (54±15) years old, including 41 females (38.7%). The follow-up time was 37.5(14.3, 76.8) months. At the last follow-up, 12 patients died (HOCM-PTSMA non-survivor group) and 92 were alive(HOCM-PTSMA survivor group). The proportion of patients with NYHA function class Ⅲ/Ⅳ was higher(P=0.036), and the posterior wall of the left ventricle was thicker(P=0.006) in the HOCM-PTSMA non-survivor group than in the HOCM-PTSMA survivor group. The immediate success rate of PTSMA in this cohort was 66%(70/104). The amount of absolute alcohol during the operation in the HOCM-PTSMA non-survivor group was (2.9±0.8) ml, which tended to be higher as compared to that in the HOCM-PTSMA survivor group((2.4±1.0)ml, P=0.056). Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis showed that patients with HOCM who underwent PTSMA had an all-cause mortality-free survival rate of 90.1%, 78.3%, and 56.9% at 5, 10 and 15 years, and a HOCM-free survival rate of 91.3%, 79.4% and 57.7% at 5, 10 and 15 years, respectively. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that age≥ 65 years was an independent risk factor for all-cause death after PTSMA in patients with HOCM (HR=2.697, 95%CI 1.292-18.977, P=0.020). There were 32 patients in the surgical myectomy group. The proportion of patients with NYHA function class Ⅲ/Ⅳ was higher than that in the PTSMA group(P<0.001), while age, gender, and major comorbidities(atrial fibrillation, coronary heart disease, hypertension, and diabetes) as well as the left atrium dimension were all similar between the two groups(all P>0.05). Patients in the surgical myectomy group were followed up for 38.0(17.6, 64.2)months, and no deaths occurred during the follow-up period. Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis showed that there were no statistically significant differences in all-cause-free and HOCM-free survival rates between patients in PTSMA group and surgical myectomy group(P=0.089 and 0.110, respectively). Conclusion: PTSMA is safe and effective for the treatment of patients with HOCM, and the long-term survival rate of patients after PTSMA is similar as patients undergoing classical surgical myectomy surgery.  
[The role of three-dimensional speckle tracking imaging derived parameters on predicting outcome of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients with MYH7 mutations].  ;"Objective: To evaluate the cardiac functional changes in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy(HCM) patients with β-myosin heavy chain gene (MYH7) mutations by three-dimensional (3D) speckle tracking imaging(3D-STI) and conventional echocardiography modalities, and then to explore the potential predictors of adverse cardiovascular events in these patients. Methods: A consecutive series of 192 HCM patients admitted in our center from October 2014 to October 2016 were genetically screened to identify MYH7 mutations in this retrospective study. A total of 43 HCM patients with MYH7 mutations were enrolled. The patients were divided into events group(n=13) and no event group(n=30) according to the presence or absence of adverse cardiovascular events(primary and secondary endpoints). All patients were followed up to January 2019 after comprehensive evaluation of 3D-STI, two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography. The adverse cardiovascular events were recorded. Results: The median follow up time was 1 012 (812, 1 330) days. During follow-up, 13 patients (30.2%) reached endpoints: 6 cases of the primary endpoints(2 cases of sudden cardiac death(SCD), 3 cases of survival after defibrillation, and 1 case of appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator(ICD) discharge); 7 cases of the second endpoints(5 cases of heart failure hospitalization, 1 case of syncope and cardioversion due to supraventricular tachycardia, and 1 case of end-stage HCM). Patients with adverse cardiovascular events had higher prevalence of syncope and risk of SCD, enlarged left atrial volume index(LAVI) and reduced 3D left ventricular global longitudinal train (3D-GLS), as compared to those without adverse events(all P<0.05). The multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that reduced 3D-GLS(HR=0.814, 95%CI 0.663-0.999, P=0.049) was an independent predictor for adverse cardiovascular events. The cutoff value of 3D-GLS≤13.67% was linked with significantly increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events in this patient cohort(AUC=0.753, 95%CI 0.558-0.948, sensitivity 86%, specificity 69%, P<0.05). The Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that the patients with the 3D-GLS≤ 13.67% faced higher risk of death than those with 3D-GLS>13.67%. Conclusion: 3D-GLS is useful on predicting adverse cardiovascular events in HCM patients with MYH7 mutations.  "
Transcatheter aortic valve-in-valve-in-valve implantation with three-dimensional printing guidance: A case report.  ;"BACKGROUND: Valve-in-valve implantation (ViV) has become a valid option for the treatment of bioprosthetic valve failure. We describe the first in-man transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) or ""turducken"" in a patient with previous TAVR within surgical aortic valve replacement with preprocedural guidance utilizing three-dimensional (3D) printing and intraprocedural guidance with fusion imaging. CASE SUMMARY: A 65-year-old male with a previous valve-in-valve with a transcatheter Melody valve presented with symptomatic severe valvular and paravalvular aortic incompetence. Using 3D printing for preprocedural guidance and computed tomography angiography-fluoroscopy fusion imaging for intraprocedural guidance we successfully placed a 29 mm self-expanding valve with minimal residual gradients. The patient continued to be asymptomatic at 1- and 5-year follow-up. DISCUSSION: We describe the first in man aortic valve-in-valve-in-valve using preprocedural guidance with 3D printing and intraprocedural guidance with fusion imaging. The valve has continued to demonstrate good function up to 5 years postprocedure suggesting that transcatheter aortic valve-in-valve-in-valve may be feasible with the proper pre- and intraprocedural guidance.

Successful implantation of self-expanding valve for a failed stentless prosthesis.  ;Valve-in-valve transcatheter aortic valve implantation is currently used for failed bioprosthesis. The use of a transcatheter prosthesis in a regurgitant noncalcified root implanted Medtronic Freestyle prosthesis is particularly challenging. We present a successful transaxillary valve-in-valve implantation of a self-expandable transcatheter aortic valve prosthesis in a failed Freestyle bioprothesis implanted eleven years earlier. Tips and tricks are discussed.  
Sex-specific cardiac remodeling in early and advanced stages of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  ;Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most frequent genetic cardiac disease with a prevalence of 1:500 to 1:200. While most patients show obstructive HCM and a relatively stable clinical phenotype (stage II), a small group of patients progresses to end-stage HCM (stage IV) within a relatively brief period. Previous research has shown sex-differences in stage II HCM with more diastolic dysfunction in female than in male patients. Moreover, female patients more often show progression to heart failure. Here we investigated if differences in functional and structural properties of the heart may underlie sex-differences in disease progression from stage II to stage IV HCM. Cardiac tissue from stage II and IV patients was obtained during myectomy (n = 54) and heart transplantation (n = 10), respectively. Isometric force was measured in membrane-permeabilized cardiomyocytes to define active and passive myofilament force development. Titin isoform composition was assessed using gel electrophoresis, and the amount of fibrosis and capillary density were determined with histology. In accordance with disease stage-dependent adverse cardiac remodeling end-stage patients showed a thinner interventricular septal wall and larger left ventricular and atrial diameters compared to stage II patients. Cardiomyocyte contractile properties and fibrosis were comparable between stage II and IV, while capillary density was significantly lower in stage IV compared to stage II. Women showed more adverse cellular remodeling compared to men at stage II, evident from more compliant titin, more fibrosis and lower capillary density. However, the disease stage-dependent reduction in capillary density was largest in men. In conclusion, the more severe cellular remodeling in female compared to male stage II patients suggests a more advanced disease stage at the time of myectomy in women. Changes in cardiomyocyte contractile properties do not explain the progression of stage II to stage IV, while reduced capillary density may underlie disease progression to end-stage heart failure.  
Minithoracotomy vs. Conventional Mitral Valve Surgery for Rheumatic Mitral Valve Stenosis: a Single-Center Analysis of 128 Patients.  ;"OBJECTIVE: To compare the in-hospital outcomes of a right-sided anterolateral minithoracotomy with those of median sternotomy in patients who received a mitral valve replacement (MVR) because of rheumatic mitral valve stenosis (RMS). METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of 128 patients (34% male) with RMS between 2011 and 2015. The median age was 53 years (45; 56). The mean ejection fraction was 58.4±6.3%. All the subjects were divided into two groups - Group 1 contained 78 patients who underwent MVR via minithoracotomy (MT-MVR), while Group 2 contained 50 patients who underwent MVR via median sternotomy (S-MVR). RESULTS: In the MT-MVR group, a mechanical prosthesis was implanted in 72% of cases, while it was implanted in 90% of cases in the S-MVR group (P=0.01). The duration of myocardial ischemia was similar (MT-MVR, 77±24 min; S-MVR, 70±18 min) (P=0.09). However, the cardiopulmonary bypass time was lower in the S-MVR group than in the MT-MVR group (99±24 min and 119±34 min, respectively) (P≤0.001). There was no difference in the duration of mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit stay, and hospitalization period. Postoperative blood loss was lower in the MT-MVR group (P≤0.001) than in the S-MVR group. There are no statistically significant differences in postoperative complications (superficial wound infection, stroke, delirium, pericardial tamponade, pleural puncture, acute kidney insufficiency, and implantation of pacemaker). The overall in-hospital mortality was 3.9% (P=0.6). CONCLUSION: The minimally invasive approach for RMS is feasible and has an excellent cosmetic effect without increasing the risk of surgical complications.  "
Is the Newly Defined R2CHA2DS2-Vasc Score a Predictor for Late Mortality in Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement?  ;"OBJECTIVE: To assess the performance of the modified R2CHA2DS2-VASc score for predicting mid-to-long-term mortality (> 30 days) in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). METHODS: Data of 78 patients who underwent TAVR were retrospectively reviewed. R2CHA2DS2-VASc score was compared with the European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation II (EuroSCORE II or ES II) and the transcatheter valve therapytranscatheter aortic valve replacement (TVT-TAVR) risk score. RESULTS: The mean follow-up period was 17.4±9.9 months (maximum 37 months). Early mortality (first 30 days) was observed in 10 (12.8%) patients, whereas mid-to-long-term mortality (> 30 days) was observed in 26 (33.3%) patients. Non-survivors had higher values of R2CHA2DS2-VASc, ES II, and TAVR scores than survivors (P<0.001, P<0.001, and P=0.001, respectively). Analysis of Pearson's correlation revealed that R2CHA2DS2-VASc score was moderately correlated with ES II and TAVR scores (r=0.51, P<0.001; r=0.44, P=0.001, respectively). Pairwise comparisons of R2CHA2DS2-VASc (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.870, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.776-0.964; P<0.001), ES II (AUC: 0.801, 95% CI: 0.703-0.899; P<0.001), and TAVR scores (AUC: 0.730, 95% CI: 0.610-852; P=0.002) showed similar accuracy for predicting mortality. R2CHA2DS2-VASc score is an independent predictor of mortality in multivariable Cox regression analysis. A cutoff value of six for R2CHA2DS2-VASc score showed a sensitivity of 74% and a specificity of 89% for predicting mid-to-long-term mortality. CONCLUSION: R2CHA2DS2-VASc score, easily calculated from clinical parameters, is associated with prediction of mid-to-longterm mortality in patients undergoing TAVR.  "
German Aortic Valve Score in Risk Assessment for Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement in a Brazilian Center.  ;"OBJECTIVE: To test the German Aortic Valve (GAV) score at our university hospital in patients undergoing isolated aortic valve replacement (AVR). METHODS: A total of 224 patients who underwent isolated conventional AVR between January 2015 and December 2018 were included. Patients with concomitant procedures and transcatheter aortic valve implantation were excluded. Patients' data were collected and analyzed retrospectively. Patients' risk scores were calculated according to criteria described by GAV score. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy (area under the ROC curve [AUC]) were also calculated. The calibration of the model was tested by the Hosmer-Lemeshow method. RESULTS: The mortality rate was 8.04% (18 patients). The patients' mean age was 58.2±19.3 years and 25% of them were female (56 patients). Mean GAV score was 1.73±5.86 (min: 0.0; max: 3.53). The GAV score showed excellent discriminative capacity (AUC 0.925, 95% confidence interval 0.882-0.956; P<0.001). The cutoff ""1.8"" turned out to be the best discriminatory point with the best combination of sensitivity (88.9%) and specificity (75.7%) to predict operative death. Hosmer-Lemeshow method revealed a P-value of 0.687, confirming a good calibration of the model. CONCLUSION: The GAV score applies to our population with high predictive accuracy.  "
Hemodynamic and Imaging Assessment of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement with the Inovare® Proseal using Multislice Computed Tomography.  ;OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the hemodynamic performance (i.e., gradients and paravalvular leakage [PVL]) of the new and experimental Braile Inovare® Proseal. Additionally, we aimed to assess pre and postoperatively the aortic annulus and the transcatheter prosthesis using multislice computed tomography (MSCT). METHODS: Patients were selected by a multidisciplinary heart team and referred for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). MSCT was performed before and after surgery. Measurements of the aortic valve and prosthesis were conducted and correlated with the valve gradient and residual PVL. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients were selected for the protocol. Patients had a mean age of 79 years and 38% of them were of female sex. The mean EuroSCORE II value was 12.5%±10.8. Mean gradient was reduced from 45.8±11.04 mmHg to 5.59±2.61 mmHg and there were no instances of PVL worse than mild. There were no cases of coronary obstruction or procedural death. Circularity was present in all prostheses evaluated. Circularity indexes for the prostheses were: inflow 0.05±0.03, middle third 0.04±0.02, and outflow 0.04±0.02 (P=0.08). The mean distance between the prosthesis and the left and right coronary ostia were 14.8 mm±3.3 and 17.3 mm±3, respectively. Oversizing was appropriate with a mean of 22.14%±6%. CONCLUSION: Braile Inovare® Proseal transcatheter device has demonstrated low gradients with low rates of PVL. Oversizing by annular measurements was adequate. MSCT was adequate to evaluate device sizing and has demonstrated preserved expansibility and circularity in the evaluated cases.  
Impact of type and size of annuloplasty prosthesis on hemodynamic status after mitral valve repair for degenerative disease.  ;OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to evaluate mitral valve hemodynamics after mitral valve repair for degenerative disease, and seek the impact of type/size of annuloplasty prosthesis on resting cardiac hemodynamics. METHODS: Between October 2012 and June 2019, 301 patients underwent isolated mitral valve repair for degenerative disease were enrolled. Correlation between postoperative mitral hemodynamics and type/size of annuloplasty prosthesis was evaluated. RESULTS: There were significant correlations between annuloplasty size and peak velocity (r = -0.41, p < 0.001), peak transmitral pressure gradient (TMPG) (r = -0.40, p < 0.001), mean TMPG (r = -0.41, p < 0.001), effective orifice area (EOA) (r = 0.26, p < 0.001), and pulmonary artery systolic pressure (r = -0.15, p = 0.010). In patients with larger annuloplasty prostheses (≥30 mm), the type of annuloplasty prosthesis (band or ring) did not influence the mitral hemodynamics, however, mean TMPG was significantly greater in patients with a full ring (2.9 mmHg [2.1-3.7] vs. 4.0 mmHg [2.8-5.0], p < 0.001) in patients with smaller annuloplasty (<30 mm). Left ventricular ejection fraction and stroke volume were significantly associated with an increase of TMPG (r = 0.14, p = 0.016 and r = 0.24, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: A larger partial band had the potential to improve mitral hemodynamics after mitral repair for degenerative disease. However, echocardiographic mitral hemodynamics was influenced by LV function. Therefore, a more accurate method is required to elucidate the true impact of mitral repair on hemodynamics.  
Alcohol Consumption and Cardiovascular Disease: A Mendelian Randomization Study.  ;"BACKGROUND: The causal role of alcohol consumption for cardiovascular disease remains unclear. We used Mendelian randomization (MR) to predict the effect of alcohol consumption on 8 cardiovascular diseases. METHODS: Up to 94 single-nucleotide polymorphisms were used as instrumental variables for alcohol consumption. Genetic association estimates for cardiovascular diseases were obtained from large-scale consortia and UK Biobank. Analyses were conducted using the inverse variance-weighted, weighted median, MR-PRESSO, MR-Egger, and multivariable MR methods. RESULTS: Genetically predicted alcohol consumption was consistently associated with stroke and peripheral artery disease across the different analyses. The odds ratios (ORs) per 1-SD increase of log-transformed alcoholic drinks per week were 1.27 ([95% CI, 1.12-1.45] P=2.87×10-4) for stroke and 3.05 ([95% CI, 1.92-4.85] P=2.30×10-6) for peripheral artery disease in the inverse variance-weighted analysis. There was some evidence for positive associations of genetically predicted alcohol consumption with coronary artery disease (OR, 1.16 [95% CI, 1.00-1.36]; P=0.052), atrial fibrillation (OR, 1.17 [95% CI, 1.00-1.37]; P=0.050), and abdominal aortic aneurysm (OR, 2.60 [95% CI, 1.15-5.89]; P=0.022) in the inverse variance-weighted analysis. These associations were somewhat attenuated in multivariable MR analysis adjusted for smoking initiation. There was no evidence of associations of genetically predicted alcohol consumption with heart failure (OR, 1.00 [95% CI, 0.68-1.47]; P=0.996), venous thromboembolism (OR, 1.04 [95% CI, 0.77-1.39]; P=0.810), and aortic valve stenosis (OR, 1.03 [95% CI, 0.56-1.90]; P=0.926). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence of a causal relationship between higher alcohol consumption and increased risk of stroke and peripheral artery disease. The causal role of alcohol consumption for other cardiovascular diseases requires further research.  "
Hybrid Approach to Right Ventricle Decompression in Muscular Pulmonary Atresia with Intact Ventricular Septum.  ;Muscular pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum (PA/IVS) in neonates is traditionally managed by surgery. We describe hybrid approach to decompress the right ventricle (RV) and establish RV to pulmonary artery connection in a neonate avoiding cardiopulmonary bypass. A 21-gauge access needle was used to perforate the atretic pulmonary valve via periventricular approach followed by stent placement. This case is an example of how patients with congenital heart disease can be palliated in creative ways through thoughtful collaboration between surgical and interventional cardiology teams.  
Invasive versus non-invasive assessment of valvuloarterial impedance in severe aortic stenosis.  ;BACKGROUND: As a measure of the global left ventricular afterload, valvuloarterial impedance (ZVA) can be estimated using transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and invasive measuring methods. The objective of this study was to compare the performance of TTE in measuring ZVA with invasive haemodynamics, direct Fick and thermodilution (TD), in patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS). METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of 66 patients with severe AS who underwent TTE and bilateral heart catheterisation preaortic valve replacement. ZVA was calculated non-invasively from TTE and invasively using TD and Fick. The differences in measurements were estimated using a generalised estimating equation approach. The exchangeability of the measurements from different methods was evaluated under binary risk stratification rules. RESULTS: The mean±SD ZVA by TTE was 4.6±1.4 vs 4.9±1.6 by TD vs 4.3±1.2 mm Hg m2/mL by Fick. From multivariate analyses, ZVA by TTE was 5.9% (95% CI -15.0 to 2.5) lower than by TD and 5.9% (95% CI -1.5 to 12.8) higher than by Fick. At the same time, ZVA by TD was 12.5% (3.0 to 22.9) higher than with Fick. Risk classifications for ZVA-based binary decision rules showed poor agreement between TTE and invasive methods (kappa ≤0.3). CONCLUSIONS: The differences in ZVA estimates between TTE and invasive standards do not appear to exceed those between the standards. As such TTE-based estimates may be deemed acceptable as a clinical measure of global haemodynamic load. However, TTE-based and invasive measurements may not be interchangeable to identify patients at risk using binary classification rules based on ZVA.  
Prevalence and clinical significance of cardiovascular magnetic resonance adenosine stress-induced myocardial perfusion defect in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  ;BACKGROUND: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is thought to be associated with microvascular dysfunction. Adenosine stress-perfusion cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) is a sensitive method for assessing microvascular perfusion abnormalities. We evaluated the prevalence and clinical characteristics of HCM patients with adenosine-induced perfusion defects on CMR. METHODS: Among 189 consecutive patients with HCM who underwent adenosine-stress perfusion CMR, 115 patients who had clinical, echocardiography, 24-h Holter monitoring and treadmill exercise test data were analyzed. We calculated myocardial perfusion ratio index from the intensity-over-time curve to quantify perfusion defects. The presence and extent of the stress-induced perfusion defect were compared with clinical characteristics, presence and extent of late gadolinium enhancement (LGE), left ventricular (LV) mass index and volume, presence of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) and results of treadmill exercise test. RESULTS: The mean age of enrolled patients was 51.8 ± 11.3 years. Most patients were asymptomatic except 25 subjects presented with New York Heart Association Class II dyspnea and 16 patients with atypical non-exertional chest discomfort. LGE was present in 103 (89.6%) subjects. Adenosine stress-induced perfusion defects were present in 48 (42%) subjects. None of the perfusion defects corresponded with a single or multiple coronary artery territories, showing a multiple patchy pattern in 24 (50.0%), a concentric subendocardial pattern in 20 subjects (41.7%), and as a single blot-like defect in the remaining 4 (8.3%). A perfusion defect was associated with NSVT, LV apical aneurysm, higher LV mass index, and higher LGE volume on univariate analysis. Multivariate analysis revealed female gender (P = 0.008), presence of apical aneurysm and NSVT (P = 0.036 and 0.047, respectively), and LV mass index (P = 0.022) to be independently associated with adenosine stress-induced perfusion defects. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with HCM, adenosine-stress perfusion defects on CMR are present in more than 40% of subjects. This perfusion defect is associated with NSVT, higher LV mass index, and apical aneurysms. The prognostic value of this finding needs further elucidation.  
Comparison of safety and outcomes with two approaches to the mitral valve.  ;BACKGROUND AND AIM: The efficacy of the superior trans-septal (STS) approach to the mitral valve has been offset by the perceived risks of adverse postoperative events. The aim of this study was to review our experience with using the left atriotomy (LA) and STS approaches in patients undergoing mitral valve surgery. METHODS: Charts of patients who underwent mitral valve surgery by a single surgeon over a period of 20 years were reviewed retrospectively. A total of 319 patients (aged 42.9 ± 16.2 years) were studied. Surgical operations were carried out through the LA approach in 111 patients, and through the STS approach in 208 patients. RESULTS: The two groups were comparable in terms of patients' characteristics, but cardiopulmonary bypass and aortic cross-clamp times were longer in the STS approach group (P = .0005). No technical complications related to either approach occurred. Rates of re-exploration for postoperative bleeding, durations of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, in-hospital days, and mortality were comparable in both approaches. Statistical analyses indicated that a patient was more likely to maintain a preoperative sinus rhythm if the LA approach rather than the STS approach was used (P < .05). On the other hand, when the preoperative heart rhythm was atrial fibrillation, no significant difference in perioperative changes in heart rhythm was observed between the two approaches. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that the routine use of the STS approach is not associated with important adverse postoperative outcomes, but is associated with increased incidence of postoperative sinus node dysfunction in patients who were in sinus rhythm preoperatively.  
Caution regarding potential changes in AVR practices during the COVID-19 pandemic.  ;To improve resource allocation in face of the COVID-19 pandemic, hospitals around the country are restricting the performance of elective surgery to preserve ventilators, operating rooms, ICU beds and protect anesthesiologists. For patients with severe aortic stenosis, efforts to bring treatment to symptomatic patients amid this pandemic might lead to favored use of catheter based management using minimalist techniques that do not require these elements. In this context, some patients with well tested surgical indications for valve replacement may be treated by catheter-based methods. It is important that outcomes for these cases are followed closely both at respective sites and in national registries. As we recover from this pandemic, surgical cases should once again be driven by multi-disciplinary discussion and clinical trial data, and not a mentality of crisis management.  
Tricuspid Regurgitation in Ostium Secundum Atrial Septal Defects: Repair or Not?  ;BACKGROUND: Longstanding ostium secundum atrial septal defects lead to functional tricuspid regurgitation. Significant functional tricuspid regurgitation associated with left heart valve disease is addressed at the time of primary left heart valve surgery. In contrast, there is no global recommendation for tricuspid regurgitation associated with atrial septal defects. This study assesses changes in tricuspid regurgitation after isolated atrial septal defect closure. METHODS: Retrospectively, records were examined of 100 patients who underwent isolated ostium secundum atrial septal defect closure without tricuspid valve repair. Echocardiograms were done preoperatively and 3 days, 3 months, and 1 year after surgery. Data on tricuspid regurgitation status, right ventricle dimensions, and pulmonary artery hypertension status were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: After surgical closure, echocardiography showed a regression of tricuspid regurgitation to mild or less in 76% of patients at 3 days, 89% at 3 months, and 93% at 1 year. Severe pulmonary artery hypertension (32% patients preoperatively) showed statistically significant regression: 14% at 3 days, 10% at 3 months, and 2% at 1 year. Preoperatively, the mean right ventricular internal diameter was 37.9 mm, which decreased to 34 ± 5.5 mm (mean ± standard deviation) at 3 days, 32.3 ± 5.3 mm at 3 months, and 31.3 ± 5.4 mm at 1 year. It was also noted that regression favored patients who were <25 years old. CONCLUSION: Tricuspid valve repair may not be required in patients with ostium secundum atrial septal defect with functional tricuspid regurgitation.  
Influence of Age on Cardiac Surgery Outcomes in United States Veterans.  ;"OBJECTIVE: Heart disease is still the leading cause of death for both men and women in the United States, and the rate of cardiovascular disease in veterans is even higher than in civilians. This study examines age-related outcomes for veterans undergoing cardiac surgeries at a single institution. METHODS: We included all veterans undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and/or valve surgery between 1997 to 2017 at a single Veterans Affairs (VA) medical center. We stratified this cohort into 4 age groups: ≤59 years old, 60-69 years old, 70-79 years old, and ≥80 years old. Outcomes in age groups were compared using standard statistical methods with the ≤59 years old group as reference. RESULTS: A total of 2,301 patients underwent open cardiac procedures at our institution. The frequency of simultaneous CABG and valve operations increased with age. Usage of cardiopulmonary bypass versus off-pump CABG and operative time was not associated with age. Increased pulmonary and renal complications as well as rates of postoperative arrhythmias all were associated with increasing age. There was no statistically significant difference in 30-day mortality. However, multivariable analysis adjusted for covariates showed all-cause mortality significantly was increased with older age groups (aHR ≥80 years old: 2.94 [2.07-4.17], P < .01; aHR 70-79 years old: 2.15 [1.63-2.83], P < 0.01, with ≤59 years old as reference). CONCLUSIONS: Older patients may have comparable perioperative mortality as their younger counterparts. However, age still is a significant predictor of all-cause mortality, pulmonary and renal complications, and postoperative arrhythmia, and should be considered as a major factor in preoperative risk assessment.

Mitral Valve Surgery via a Right Infra-axillary Thoracotomy in High-Risk Reoperative Patients.  ;"BACKGROUND: A right infra-axillary thoracotomy can offer excellent exposure of the mitral valve. This study evaluated this incision for high-risk patients undergoing redo mitral valve procedures. METHODS: Of a series of 189 patients who had redo mitral valve surgery, 32 were reoperated via vertical infra-axillary thoracotomy based on previous aortic valve replacement, dense adhesion, location of patent bypass grafts, and peripheral vascular disease. RESULTS: Sternotomy was avoided in all cases. The mitral valve was replaced in 22 patients and repaired in 10 patients; left atrial folding was performed in 6 patients. All patients had uneventful outcomes and normal valve function during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Reoperative mitral valve surgeries can be performed safely using right infra-axillary thoracotomy in certain patients. The procedure offers excellent exposure of the mitral valve and minimizes the need for cardiac dissection, thus reducing injury risk. Avoiding a high risk of resternotomy increases patient comfort and safety.  "
Surgical Treatment of Primary Cardiac Tumor Associated with Malignant Arrhythmias.  ;OBJECTIVE: Pediatric primary cardiac tumor is an extremely rare disease. The tumor can extend into the conduction system and cause malignant arrhythmias. We retrospectively reviewed 6 consecutive cases of children with primary cardiac tumor that manifested as rhythm disturbance. METHODS: In our center, 6 children were enrolled from October 2009 to August 2016. Detailed operative data and follow-up information were comprehensively collected and statistically analyzed. RESULTS: The patients were ages 1 to 16 years and weighed 7.9 to 44.5 kg. Preoperative ventricular tachycardia was present in 3 patients, frequent ventricular ectopic beats in 1 patient, supraventricular tachycardia in 1 patient, and atrial flutter in 1 patient. All 6 patients underwent a complete tumor resection. The tumors were localized in the left ventricular free wall (3 patients), left ventricular outflow tract (1 patient), left atrium (1 patient), and right atrium (1 patient). One patient received 2 radiofrequency ablation procedures before tumor resection. Postoperative sick sinus syndrome occurred in 1 patient because the tumor infiltrated the sinoatrial node. Tumors from 2 patients were pathologically diagnosed as fibroma and 4 as rhabdomyoma. Reoperation of mitral valve repair was performed in 1 patient 1 year after tumor resection. The mean (± SD) follow-up time was 63.7 ± 31.4 months, and all children were well, with Ross functional classification I and no signs of recurrence or metastasis. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, cardiac tumor is a rare but nonneglectable reason for arrhythmia, and surgical resection is the optimal procedure, with satisfactory results.  
Hinge point-based annular plane with abnormal aortic cusps in transcatheter aortic valve replacement.  ;A virtual aortic annular plane that is built using the three hinge points, known as the hinge point-based annular plane (HPAP), is routinely used during transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Abnormal aortic cusps (AAC) with unequal length and size influence the relationship of the HPAP to the aortic root axis significantly and pose challenges to valve deployment, leading to paravalvular leak and valve embolisation. Obtaining a centreline-based aortic annular plane in addition may help to understand valve deployment behaviour in AAC better.  
Use of radiographic measurements to diagnose stage B2 preclinical myxomatous mitral valve disease in dogs.  ;DOI: 10.2460/javma.256.10.1129 PMID: 32364449 [Indexed for MEDLINE]  
Are there any novel markers in acute rheumatic fever: neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio, and monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio.  ;"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte, platelet-to-lymphocyte, and monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratios in acute rheumatic fever in children. METHOD: In this retrospective study, 182 patients with acute rheumatic fever and 173 controls were included. Complete blood count parameters, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte, monocyte-to-lymphocyte, and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratios were recorded for all the patients underwent transthoracic echocardiography. RESULTS: Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte, monocyte-to-lymphocyte, and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratios were significantly higher in patients with rheumatic heart disease than patients without cardiac involvement (p < 0.05). C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate levels were found to have a positive correlation with neutrophil-to-lymphocyte (r = 0.228, p = 0.001; r = 0.355, p = 0.001), platelet-to-lymphocyte (r = 0.227, p = 0.01; r = 0.149, p = 0.005), and monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratios (r = 0.117, p = 0.005; r = 0.107, p = 0.044). Cardiac involvement was present in 152 (83.5%) of the patients. Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte, monocyte-to-lymphocyte, and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratios were significantly higher in patients with rheumatic heart disease than patients without cardiac involvement (p < 0.05). Patients with carditis were grouped according to mitral, aortic, or both valve involvement but there was no significant difference between the groups with respect to neutrophil-to-lymphocyte, monocyte-to-lymphocyte, and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratios. In addition, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte and monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratios were significantly higher in patients with Sydenham's chorea than without chorea (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte, platelet-to-lymphocyte, and monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratios may help make the diagnosis of acute rheumatic fever and its prognosis by serial measurements in follow-up but none of them tell us the severity of carditis. Also, this is the first study showing the positive correlation between Sydenham's chorea and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte and monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratios. Further studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis, as this is the first study in the literature on this topic.  "

[Determination of cytokines and adhesion molecules in elderly and senile patients with aortic valve calcification.].  ;A laboratory study of the cytokine profile and the content of the intercellular adhesion molecules was performed in 38 patients with initial signs of aortic hemilunus calcification. It has been determined that the content of IL-6 and IL-8 had significantly higher values compared with the control group, which indicates the direct role of nonspecific chronic inflammation in the development of calcifying aortic valve damage. A significantly lower content of sE-selectin was also identified, which may indicate the absence of activation of adhesion molecules at the initial stage of aortic valve calcification. Further study of the dynamics of sE- and sP-selectins content in the process of development of acceleration of blood flow in the aortic valve and the formation of stenosis is needed.  
Outcomes of isolated surgical aortic valve replacement in the era of transcatheter aortic valve implantation.  ;"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Until early into the 21st century, the only therapeutic option for aortic valve (AV) stenosis was surgical aortic valve replacement (AVR), but this changed with the introduction of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). Our objective was to present the results of surgical AVR performed in low-risk patients in the era of TAVI, in a large tertiary medical center. METHODS: Data from low surgical risk patients (defined as Euroscore < 5) greater than 60 years of age, who underwent isolated AVR surgery between 2004 and 2018, were obtained from our departmental database. Of the 313 study patients, 110 (35%) underwent isolated AVR before 2010 (early period) and 203 patients (65%) underwent the same procedure from 2010 onward (late period). RESULTS: Mean age was 67 ± 5 years and 182 (58%) were male. Fifty-six patients (18%) had a unicuspid or bicuspid AV. Patient characteristics were similar between the early and late periods. There was no in-hospital or 30-day mortality throughout the entire cohort, with one case (0.3%) of postoperative stroke. Permanent pacemaker implantation was required in 2.2% (N = 7). Patients in the early period required significantly more re-exploration due to bleeding/tamponade (8.2% vs 1.5%; P = .008). Long-term mortality (1, 3, and 5 years) was higher in the early compared with the late period (2.7% vs 1%, 7.3% vs 3%, and 15.5% vs 3.4%, respectively; log-rank P = .005). CONCLUSIONS: Surgical AVR provides excellent short- and long-term results with low morbidity and mortality in low surgical risk patients. While patient characteristics did not change dramatically over the years, the long-term results were encouraging.  "
Advances in Clinical Cardiology 2019: A Summary of Key Clinical Trials.  ;INTRODUCTION: A large number of important clinical trials in cardiology were published or presented at major international conferences during 2019. This paper aims to offer a concise overview of these significant advances and to put them into clinical context. METHODS: Trials presented at the major international cardiology meetings during 2019 were reviewed including The American College of Cardiology (ACC), Euro PCR, The European Society of Cardiology (ESC), Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics (TCT), and the American Heart Association (AHA). In addition to this a literature search identified several other publications eligible for inclusion based on their relevance to clinical cardiology, their potential impact on clinical practice and on future guidelines. RESULTS: A total of 70 trials met the inclusion criteria. New interventional and structural data include trials examining use of drug-coated balloons in patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI), interventions following shockable cardiac arrest, mechanical circulatory support in cardiogenic shock complicating MI, intervention in stable coronary artery disease, surgical or percutaneous revascularisation strategies in left main coronary artery disease, revascularisation strategy in ST elevation MI, transcatheter aortic valve replacement in low-risk patients, and percutaneous mitral or tricuspid valve interventions. Preventative cardiology data included the use of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors (dapagliflozin), proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors (evolocumab), bempedoic acid, and novel approaches to the management of hypertension. Antiplatelet data included trials evaluating both the optimal length of course and combination of antiplatelet agents and regimes including combination antithrombotic therapies for patients with atrial fibrillation. Heart failure data included trials of sacubitril-valsartan in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and the use of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with heart failure but without diabetes. Electrophysiology data included trials examining alcohol in atrial fibrillation and the use of wearable fitness devices for identifying atrial fibrillation. CONCLUSION: This article presents key clinical trials completed during 2019 and should be valuable to clinicians and researchers working in cardiology.  
Association of aortic valve calcification and vitamin K antagonist treatment.  ;"AIMS : Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) are suspected of causing aortic valve calcification (AVC). The objective of this study was to clarify whether patients undergoing VKA treatment have increased AVC scores compared to patients treated with new oral anticoagulants (NOACs) and patients who never have been treated with VKA/NOAC. METHODS AND RESULTS : We included participants from the population-based DANCAVAS trial (n = 15 048). Information on confounders was collected, and the AVC scores were measured on non-contrast computed tomography scans. The participants' medication data, including VKA and NOAC data, were collected from the Danish National Health Service Prescription Database. The final population consisted of 14 604 participants (67.4 years, 95% men) of whom 873 had been treated with VKA and 602 with NOAC. The association between AVC score and duration of anticoagulant use was investigated in an adjusted zero-inflated negative binomial regression model. For every year treated with VKA, the AVC score increased, on average, by 6% [ratio of expected counts (RECs) = 1.06; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02-1.10] compared to non-use. The results were consistent in sensitivity analyses excluding patients with known cardiovascular disease and statin users (REC = 1.07; 95% CI 1.02-1.11 and REC = 1.10; 95% CI 1.03-1.17, respectively). NOAC treatment was not significantly associated with AVC score in any of the corresponding models (REC = 1.03, 1.02, and 0.96). CONCLUSION : Compared to no treatment with anticoagulants, VKA use was associated with increased AVC score, while a similar association could not be established for NOAC.  "
Differential Expression of the Angiotensin-(1-12)/Chymase Axis in Human Atrial Tissue.  ;BACKGROUND: Heart chymase rather than angiotensin (Ang)-converting enzyme has higher specificity for Ang I conversion into Ang II in humans. A new pathway for direct cardiac Ang II generation has been revealed through the demonstration that Ang-(1-12) is cleaved by chymase to generate Ang II directly. Herein, we address whether Ang-(1-12), chymase messenger RNA (mRNA), and activity levels can be differentiated in human atrial tissue from normal and diseased hearts and if these measures associate with various pathologic heart conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Atrial appendages were collected from 11 nonfailing donor hearts and 111 patients undergoing heart surgery for the correction of valvular heart disease, resistant atrial fibrillation, or ischemic heart disease. Chymase mRNA was analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction and enzymatic activity by high-performance liquid chromatography using Ang-(1-12) as the substrate. Ang-(1-12) levels were determined by immunohistochemical staining. RESULTS: Chymase gene transcripts, chymase activity, and immunoreactive Ang-(1-12) expression levels were higher in left atrial tissue compared with right atrial tissue, irrespective of cardiac disease. In addition, left atrial chymase mRNA expression was significantly higher in stroke versus nonstroke patients and in cardiac surgery patients who had a history of postoperative atrial fibrillation versus nonatrial fibrillation. Correlation analysis showed that left atrial chymase mRNA was positively related to left atrial enlargement, as determined by echocardiography. CONCLUSIONS: As Ang-(1-12) expression and chymase gene transcripts and enzymatic activity levels were positively linked to left atrial size in patients with left ventricular heart disease, an important alternate Ang II forming pathway, via Ang-(1-12) and chymase, in maladaptive atrial and ventricular remodeling in humans is uncovered.  
Transcatheter aortic valve replacement for patients with severe bicuspid aortic stenosis.  ;BACKGROUND: Patients with bicuspid aortic valve stenosis (BAV) were excluded from all the trileaflet aortic valve stenosis (TAV) pivotal trials, and therefore, their outcomes are not clearly defined. The aim of the study was to evaluate the outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in patients with BAV and compared them with those of TAV. METHODS: We evaluated the outcomes following TAVR of patients with BAV at our institution between April 2011 and November 2016 and compared them with the outcomes of patients with TAV treated with TAVR. The χ2 and the Mann-Whitney U tests were used to compare the groups, and a Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to estimate long-term survival. RESULTS: TAVR was performed in a total of 567 patients, from which 50 (8.8%) had BAV and 517 (91.2%) had TAV. Patients with BAV were younger and had higher prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lower prevalence of coronary artery disease, higher body mass index, and lower Society of Thoracic Surgeons score (STS PROM). Patients with BAV had a slightly higher mean aortic valve gradient postoperatively (median 12 mm Hg [10-15] vs 10 [7-13], P < .001), but paravalvular aortic regurgitation was not different between the groups (> mild 4.0% vs 3.5%, P = .541). Clinical outcomes were not different between the groups, including stroke (2.0% vs 1.5, P = .567) and the 30-day all-cause mortality (6.0% vs 1.5, P = .064). The 2-year survival (82.0% vs 83.4, P = .476) was similar between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: This initial experience suggests that TAVR can be safely performed in patients with BAV, achieving similar short-term procedural and clinical outcomes when compared with patients with TAV.  
Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome and Severe Aortic Stenosis: A New Hope for Treatment.  ;Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome is an autosomal dominant, rare, fatal pediatric segmental premature aging disease. Cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases constitute the major cause of morbidity and mortality. Patients with the syndrome and severe aortic valve stenosis have been described in the literature, and for all of them a strategy of conservative management has been followed. We describe the first successful treatment of a 23-year-old Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome patient with severe aortic stenosis who underwent transapical transcatheter aortic valve replacement.  
Value of Echocardiographic Right Ventricular and Pulmonary Pressure Assessment in Predicting Transcatheter Tricuspid Repair Outcome.  ;"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the value of echocardiographic right ventricular (RV) and systolic pulmonary artery pressure (sPAP) assessment in predicting transcatheter tricuspid edge-to-edge valve repair (TTVR) outcome. BACKGROUND: RV dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension are associated with poor prognosis and are systematically sought during tricuspid regurgitation evaluation. The value of echocardiographic assessment in predicting TTVR outcome is unknown. METHODS: Data were taken from the TriValve (Transcatheter Tricuspid Valve Therapies) registry, which includes patients undergoing TTVR at 14 European and North American centers. The primary outcome was 1-year survival free from hospitalization for heart failure, and secondary outcomes were 1-year survival and absence of hospital admission for heart failure at 1 year. RESULTS: Overall, 249 patients underwent TTVR between June 2015 and 2018 (mean tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion [TAPSE] 15.8 ± 15.3 mm, mean sPAP 43.6 ± 16.0 mm Hg). Tricuspid regurgitation grade ≥3+ was found in 96.8% of patients at baseline and 29.4% at final follow-up; 95.6% were in New York Heart Association functional class III or IV initially, compared with 34.3% at follow-up (p < 0.05). Final New York Heart Association functional class did not differ among TAPSE and sPAP quartiles, even when both low TAPSE and high sPAP were present. Rates of 1-year survival and survival free from hospitalization for heart failure were 83.9% and 78.7%, respectively, without significant differences according to baseline echocardiographic RV characteristics (TAPSE, fractional area change, and end-diastolic area) and sPAP (p > 0.05 for all). CONCLUSIONS: TTVR provides clinical improvement, with 1-year survival free from hospital readmission >75% in patients with severe tricuspid regurgitation. Conventional echocardiographic parameters used to assess RV function and sPAP did not predict clinical outcome after TTVR.  "

Current trends of sutureless and rapid deployment valves: an 11-year experience from the Sutureless and Rapid Deployment International Registry.  ;OBJECTIVES: Current evidence on sutureless and rapid deployment aortic valve replacement (SURD-AVR) is limited and does not allow for the assessment of the clinical impact and the evolution of procedural and clinical outcomes of this new valve technology. The Sutureless and Rapid Deployment International Registry (SURD-IR) represents a unique opportunity to evaluate the current trends and outcomes of SURD-AVR interventions. METHODS: Data from 3682 patients enrolled between 2007 and 2018 were analysed. Patients were divided according to the date of surgery into 6 equal groups and by the type of intervention: isolated SURD-AVR (n = 2472) and combined SURD-AVR (n = 1086). RESULTS: Across the 11-year study period, significant changes occurred in patient characteristics including a decrease in age and in estimated surgical risk. Less invasive approaches for isolated SURD-AVR increased considerably from 49.4% to 85.5%. The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 1.6% and 3.9% in isolated and combined procedures, respectively, with no change over time. The rate of perioperative stroke decreased significantly (from 4% to 0.5%), as did the rates of postoperative pacemaker implantation (from 12.8% to 5.9%) and aortic regurgitation (from 17.8% to 2.7%). CONCLUSIONS: The present study provides a comprehensive analysis of the current trends and results of SURD-AVR interventions. The most notable changes over time were the increasing implantation of SURD valves in a younger population, with more frequent utilization of less invasive techniques. SURD-AVR demonstrated remarkable improvements in clinical outcomes with a significant reduction in the rates of stroke, pacemaker implantation and postoperative aortic regurgitation.  
Catheter-based cerebral protection system in open cardiac surgery: An example of true hybrid surgery.  ;Postoperative stroke after cardiac surgery is an ominous complication. Clinical manifestations range from cognitive disturbances and altered states of consciousness to focal neurological deficits. Stroke is also a well-documented risk of catheter-based cardiac interventions. Recently, the growth of transcatheter procedures has led to the increasing development of devices that are designed to minimize neurological events during valve implantation.  In this video tutorial we demonstrate how to transfer a catheter-based cerebral protection technology into an open cardiac surgical intervention. The operation shown in this tutorial was an aortic valve replacement and the cerebral protection device implanted was the  Sentinel Cerebral Protection System (Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA, USA).  
Implantation of a decellularized aortic homograft in a child.  ;The implantation of a decellularized aortic homograft in children and young adults has been shown to be a good alternative to existing surgical approaches. Lower risk of calcification and the potential of growth render a homograft a promising valve substitute. The child presented in this video tutorial is a 10-year-old boy diagnosed with congenital aortic stenosis which was treated by balloon valvuloplasty early in life. Current echocardiographic findings show severe aortic regurgitation and stenosis. The tutorial provides detailed insight into how to implant a decellularized aortic homograft as a total root replacement.

Integrated analysis of immunocyte infiltration and differential gene expression in tricuspid aortic valve-associated thoracic aortic aneurysms.  ;BACKGROUND: Progressive dilatation is responsible for significant mortality and morbidity in patients with thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs). Studies have shown that the development and progression of TAAs are closely related to immune regulatory pathways and genes. Therefore, it is important to understand the immune regulatory mechanisms and biomarkers of TAA dilatation. METHODS: Systematic bioinformatics analysis was applied, including linear models for microarray data (LIMMA) differential expression analyses, principal component analysis (PCA), immunocyte identification, and genetic function enrichment analysis. RESULTS: Our results showed that both aortic intima-media (AMed) and outer aortic adventitia (AAdv) tissues were closely associated with T cell activation during the process of tricuspid aortic valve (TAV)-associated TAA dilation. Additionally, the degree of infiltration of resting memory CD4+ T cells was linked to both AAdv and AMed vascular dilation. The core regulators PPTRC, IL1B, CD4, CD3G, and IL2RA were also identified and are closely related to resting memory CD4+ T cell infiltration in this pathological process. CONCLUSIONS: The candidate genes PPTRC, IL1B, CD4, CD3G, and IL2RA were involved in the regulation of resting memory CD4 T cell tissue infiltration, which is closely related to the process of AAdv and AMed vascular dilation in TAV patients.  
Focus on the annuloplasty in aortic valve repair: implications from a quantitative multislice computed tomography analysis.  ;"BACKGROUND: Aortic valve (AV) repair has evolved towards a treatment alternative in young patients with AV regurgitation and was accompanied by the development of surgical repair strategies. An efficient and reproducible AV annulus stabilization (i.e., annuloplasty) has been proposed as a crucial component to obtain the long-term stability of AV repair. However, there is still major controversy regarding the most appropriate annuloplasty approach. We aimed to address AV annulus structures which are relevant for AV annuloplasty, based on MS-CT data. METHODS: We retrospectively analysed 326 consecutive patients with AV disease who all underwent preprocedural MS-CT examination. Study cohort was subdivided according to the underlying AV pathology: 25 patients with aortic regurgitation (AR subgroup) (mean age 73±11 years, 68% male), 243 patients with aortic stenosis (AS subgroup) (73±11 years, 68% male) and 58 patients with normally functioning AV (normal AV subgroup) (mean age 76±7 years, 36% male). We systematically measured maximum and minimum AV annulus diameter, AV annular area, projected AV annular perimeter and anatomic AV annular perimeter during mid-systole using MS-CT data. Based on these measurements, AV annular eccentricity index was calculated [(max AV annulus × 100/min AV annulus) - 100]. Furthermore, we assessed the tissue components of AV annular plane, distinguishing between muscular and fibrous portions of the basal ring. RESULTS: AV annular eccentricity index was significantly larger in the normal AV-subgroup as compared to the AR-subgroup (33.2%±10.7% vs. 27.8%±9.2%; P=0.048) as well as to the AS-subgroup (33.2%±10.7% vs. 20.4%±8.8%; P<0.001). AV annular area was significantly larger in the AR subgroup as compared to the AS subgroup (5.7±1.0 vs. 5.1±0.8 cm2; P=0.003) and normal AV subgroup (5.7±1.0 vs. 4.8±0.8 cm2; P<0.001). Intramuscular plane in the right coronary sinus was significantly increased in the AR subgroup vs. AS subgroup (12.8±2.7 vs. 7.5±3.6 mm; P<0.001) and normal AV subgroup (12.8±2.7 vs. 8.7±3.0 mm; P<0.001). Muscular component of the basal ring was significantly reduced in the AR subgroup vs. AS subgroup (37.5%±5.1% vs. 40.5%±5.5%; P=0.039) and normal AV subgroup (37.5%±5.1% vs. 44.3%±10.2%; P=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: MS-CT enables a quantitative analysis of aortic root anatomy which may have an impact on AV annuloplasty. AR patients differ significantly regarding their AV annular dimensions and basal ring morphology as compared to the AS patients and those with a normal AV function. These findings may have major implications in tricuspid AV repair when designing the most appropriate AV annulus stabilisation technique.  "

4D flow cardiovascular magnetic resonance for monitoring of aortic valve repair in bicuspid aortic valve disease.  ;"BACKGROUND: Aortic valve repair has become a treatment option for adults with symptomatic bicuspid (BAV) or unicuspid (UAV) aortic valve insufficiency. Our aim was to demonstrate the feasibility of 4D flow cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) to assess the impact of aortic valve repair on changes in blood flow dynamics in patients with symptomatic BAV or UAV. METHODS: Twenty patients with adult congenital heart disease (median 35 years, range 18-64; 16 male) and symptomatic aortic valve regurgitation (15 BAV, 5 UAV) were prospectively studied. All patients underwent 4D flow CMR before and after aortic valve repair. Aortic valve regurgitant fraction and systolic peak velocity were estimated. The degree of helical and vortical flow was evaluated according to a 3-point scale. Relative flow displacement and wall shear stress (WSS) were quantified at predefined levels in the thoracic aorta. RESULTS: All patients underwent successful aortic valve repair with a significant reduction of aortic valve regurgitation (16.7 ± 9.8% to 6.4 ± 4.4%, p < 0.001) and systolic peak velocity (2.3 ± 0.9 to 1.9 ± 0.4 m/s, p = 0.014). Both helical flow (1.6 ± 0.6 vs. 0.9 ± 0.5, p < 0.001) and vortical flow (1.2 ± 0.8 vs. 0.5 ± 0.6, p = 0.002) as well as both flow displacement (0.3 ± 0.1 vs. 0.25 ± 0.1, p = 0.031) and WSS (0.8 ± 0.2 N/m2 vs. 0.5 ± 0.2 N/m2, p < 0.001) in the ascending aorta were significantly reduced after aortic valve repair. CONCLUSIONS: 4D flow CMR allows assessment of the impact of aortic valve repair on changes in blood flow dynamics in patients with bicuspid aortic valve disease.  "
Management of patients with combined arterial hypertension and aortic valve stenosis: a consensus document from the Council on Hypertension and Council on Valvular Heart Disease of the European Society of Cardiology, the European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging (EACVI), the European Association of Percutaneous Cardiovascular Interventions (EAPCI).  ;Aortic valve stenosis (AS) is the third most common cardiovascular disease. The prevalence of both AS and arterial hypertension increases with age, and the conditions therefore often co-exist. Co-existence of AS and arterial hypertension is associated with higher global left ventricular (LV) pressure overload, more abnormal LV geometry and function, and more adverse cardiovascular outcome. Arterial hypertension may also influence grading of AS, leading to underestimation of the true AS severity. Current guidelines suggest re-assessing patients once arterial hypertension is controlled. Management of arterial hypertension in AS has historically been associated with prudence and concerns, mainly related to potential adverse consequences of drug-induced peripheral vasodilatation combined with reduced stroke volume due to the fixed LV outflow obstruction. Current evidence suggests that patients should be treated with antihypertensive drugs blocking the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system, adding further drug classes when required, to achieve similar target blood pressure values as in hypertensive patients without AS. The introduction of trans-catheter aortic valve implantation has revolutionized the management of patients with AS, but requires proper blood pressure management during and following valve replacement. The purpose of this document is to review the recent evidence and provide practical expert advice on management of hypertension in patients with AS.  
Antegrade transseptal transcatheter aortic valve replacement: Back to the future?  ;Antegrade transseptal approach was utilized in the first human case of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and in the early phase of TAVR. Various challenges with the antegrade transseptal approach including procedural complexity, need for atrial septal crossing, and potential for injury to the mitral valve apparatus led it to being supplanted by other approaches. These challenges have now largely been mitigated as structural interventionalists routinely perform left atrial procedures. We report a case of antegrade transseptal TAVR using a large bore sheath placed in the mid left ventricle across the mitral orifice to protect the mitral valve apparatus and facilitate valve deployment. An 84-year-old man with heart failure symptoms was seen for severe aortic stenosis. The severity of peripheral arterial disease precluded femoral, axillary, carotid, or transcaval routes. After transseptal puncture and creation of an arteriovenous rail, a long 26-Fr sheath was advanced from the right femoral vein transseptally over the arteriovenous rail, past the mitral valve inflow to the mid left ventricular cavity. The sheath provided a stable platform with stable intraprocedure hemodynamics. Balloon valvuloplasty was performed in an antegrade manner, after which a 29-mm SAPIEN S3 prosthesis was advanced into the aortic valve position and deployed under rapid pacing. We observed no injury to the mitral leaflets or subvalvular apparatus after the procedure. The antegrade transseptal approach should be revisited as an option for patients at high surgical risk with no other suitable access site. The use of a large bore sheath facilitates this approach.

Rescue aortic balloon valvuloplasty during procedural cardiac arrest while treating critical left main stem stenosis: a case report.  ;BACKGROUND: Best timing for coronary revascularization in patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) who was a candidate for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is still matter of debate. CASE SUMMARY: We here report the case of an 87-year-old man with severe AS presenting with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Coronary angiography revealed a highly complex and calcific left main stem (LMS) lesion. Rotablation-assisted percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was attempted but was complicated by post-stenting rapidly evolving haemodynamic impairment. A rescue 'pacing-free' balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV) was performed to rescue the patients, allowing prompt restoration of cardiac output and coronary perfusion. DISCUSSION: According to guidelines and preliminary evidence, decision should be performed case by case and based on the degree of severity and complexity of either AS or coronary disease. The strategy of treating coronary lesions first may limit the risk of potential ischaemic complications during TAVI. However, the downside of it is the risk of hemodynamic crash with potential catastrophic evolution in case of PCI complications in presence of severe AS. A 'bailout BAV' can be considered as a salvage-strategy in case of complex and complicated LMS-PCI in the context of severe AS and advanced status of haemodynamic impairment. This approach must be seen as very last resort, while appropriate pre-procedural planning is still highly recommended in order to prevent potentially fatal procedural complications in this fragile clinical setting.  
Platypnoea-orthodeoxia syndrome due to deformation of the patent foramen ovale caused by a dilated ascending aorta: a case report.  ;BACKGROUND: Platypnoea-orthodeoxia syndrome (POS) is characterized by dyspnoea and arterial desaturation in the sitting position. Although its pathophysiology is complex and still needed to be investigated, the disease is one of the clinical situations which should be immediately and adequately managed by health care workers from the initial presentation. CASE SUMMARY: A 66-year-old woman with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus, deep vein thrombosis, and lumbar compression fracture was admitted for evaluation of the sudden onset of dyspnoea, while in the sitting position that was relieved on placing her in the supine position. Her transoesophageal echocardiogram did reveal a deformity in the patent foramen ovale (PFO) structure with a wide gap due to aortic compression, which was markedly different from that observed in the supine position, along with massive right-to-left shunting caused by redirected venous return due to a persistent Eustachian valve. With the computed tomography and angiograms, POS was diagnosed. Then, the patient received aortic replacement and patch closure of PFO, and her symptoms were completely resolved. DISCUSSION: Platypnoea-orthodeoxia syndrome is a condition with quite unique features and needs multiple clinical measures for the diagnosis and medical management. For all health care workers, it is essential to have a high suspicion in order to detect POS in patients with unexplained dyspnoea. Echocardiography plays a major role in establishing the diagnosis and offering the choice of therapeutic options.  
Clinical Management and Long-Term Prognosis of Combined Left-Sided Valvular Heart Disease.  ;In studies on left-sided valve disease, patients with combined lesions are generally excluded. We aimed to describe the clinical management and prognosis of patients with combined left-sided valve disease.From a single, tertiary care center, a total of 122 patients with combined left-sided valve disease of at least moderate severity were identified and compared with 143 controls with single-lesion valve disease (1VaD) of at least moderate severity. Endpoints were all-cause mortality and the combination of valve intervention and mortality.Overall survival for patients with two-lesion valve disease was significantly lower than that for patients with 1VaD (estimated 3-year survival: 52% versus 73%, P < 0.001). Compared with 1VaD, the combination of aortic stenosis and aortic regurgitation (AS/AR) was associated with a similar overall survival (hazard ratio (HR) (95% confidence interval (CI) ): 0.83 (0.47-1.48), P = 0.53), the combination of AR and mitral regurgitation (AR/MR) with an intermediate survival (HR (95% CI): 1.76 (1.03-3.00), P = 0.039) and the combination of AS and MR (AS/MR) with the poorest survival (HR (95% CI): 3.28 (2.16-4.98), P < 0.001). At 2.2 years of follow-up, the majority of patients in all three groups were either dead or had received valve intervention (AS/AR: 72%, AR/MR: 64%, and AS/MR: 80%).Combined valve disease was relatively rare but was associated with a decreased overall survival. Survival depended on the specific combination of valve lesions, with AS/MR carrying the worst prognosis. The majority of patients in all groups were either dead or had valve intervention performed within 2.2 years.  
Pulmonary Artery Aneurysm Associated with Bicuspid Pulmonary Valve.  ;A 73-year-old Japanese man was admitted with an asymptomatic pulmonary artery aneurysm. However, chest X-ray and contrast-enhanced thoracic computed tomography revealed a protrusion at the second left branch that in fact was a pulmonary artery aneurysm with a diameter of 50 mm. Transesophageal echocardiography showed a bicuspid pulmonary valve, and cardiac catheterization revealed pulmonary stenosis with a pressure gradient of 45 mmHg, but no other heart diseases were noted. An extremely rare pulmonary artery aneurysm associated with an isolated bicuspid pulmonary valve was diagnosed.

Two approaches-one phenomenon-thrombocytopenia after surgical and transcatheter aortic valve replacement.  ;BACKGROPUND AND AIM: Postoperative thrombocytopenia after surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) or transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and aggravating causes were the aim of this retrospective study. METHODS: Data of all patients treated with SAVR (n = 1068) and TAVR (n = 816) due to severe aortic valve stenosis was collected at our center from 2010 to 2017. Preprocedural and postprocedural values were collected from electronic patient records. RESULTS: There was a significant drop in platelets in both groups, the TAVR group showed overall superior platelet preservation compared to the AVR group (P < .001). In the SAVR subgroup analysis, a significant difference in platelet preservation was observed between the valve types (P < .001), particularly with the Freedom SOLO valve. In the TAVR subgroup analysis, the valve type did not influence platelet count (PLT) reduction (P = .13). In the SAVR subgroup analyses, PLT was found to be worsened with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) duration. CONCLUSION: Thrombocytopenia frequently occurs after implantation of a biological heart valve prosthesis, with a higher frequency observed in patients after cardiac surgery rather than TAVR. Although some surgical bioprosthetic models are more susceptible to this phenomenon, CPB duration seems to be a major determinant for the development of postoperative thrombocytopenia.  
Dextrocardia, situs solitus, inlet ventricular septal defect (VSD), and iatrogenic tricuspid regurgitation (TR)-A surgical perspective.  ;Dextrocardia with situs solitus is a rare congenital anomaly, often associated with intra- or extracardiac malformations. A clear understanding of the spatial orientation of the chambers of the heart for planning surgical approach, is imperative. Access to the right side of the heart, especially for repair of the tricuspid valve can be challenging. We describe a case of dextrocardia, situs solitus, inlet ventricular septal defect (VSD) with iatrogenic tricuspid regurgitation (TR) in an adult patient, highlighting the surgical aspects essential for a successful outcome.  
Epidemiological, clinical, and echocardiographic features, and outcome of dogs with Ebstein's anomaly: 32 cases (2002-2016).  ;INTRODUCTION/OBJECTIVES: Ebstein's anomaly (EA) is a congenital heart disease characterized by apical displacement of the tricuspid valve leaflets in the right ventricle. The objective of this retrospective study was to investigate the signalment, clinical features, echocardiographic findings, and outcome of dogs with EA. ANIMALS, MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medical records of 40 dogs with EA were reviewed. Echocardiographic variables used to assess EA severity in human pediatrics were also evaluated (e.g. displacement index, Celermajer index, Carpentier class, and apex-mitral annulus:apex-tricuspid annulus distance ratio). RESULTS: Labrador retriever was the most commonly recruited breed (24 of the 40 dogs, 60%). Eight of the 40 dogs with EA had hemodynamically compromising concurrent heart (n = 7) or respiratory diseases (n = 1). A right apical systolic heart murmur (median grade = 5/6) was detected in the remaining 32 dogs, without any other clinical sign related to EA in 19 of the 32 dogs (59%). Median (interquartile range) values of the displacement index and Celermajer index were 17.4 mm/m2 (12.0-21.9) and 100% (50-130), respectively. Median time to all-cause death was 74 months, and 72% dogs (95% confidence interval, 50-86%) had not succumbed to cardiac death (CD) 160 months after diagnosis. Univariate analyses showed that the time from diagnosis to CD was associated with the presence of clinical signs, ascites, severe right atrial dilation, palpable thrill, and a Celermajer index ≥100%. DISCUSSION: Right atrial enlargement is significantly associated with decreased survival time of dogs with EA although most may live for years and may not die from CD. CONCLUSIONS: These results support medium to long-term survival for most dogs with EA.  
Incidental Coronary Artery Calcification and Stroke Risk in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation.  ;"OBJECTIVE. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a major risk factor for stroke. The CHA2DS2-VASc score is used to risk stratify patients, and the score includes known coronary artery disease (CAD) as a variable. The aim of this study was to assess if the presence of incidental coronary artery calcification (CAC), without known CAD, is associated with stroke independent of CHA2DS2-VASc variables. MATERIALS AND METHODS. A retrospective review of health records was performed for patients who had AF, a chest CT scan performed within 1 year, and a subsequent visit for stroke. Patients with CAD and other vascular disease, a mechanical valve, or who were older than 74 years old were excluded. Included patients were one-to-one matched by age and CHA2DS2-VASc risk factors to patients who had had similar follow-up but who did not have a stroke. Nongated CT images were reviewed for CAC. Univariate and Cox regression analyses were performed. RESULTS. A total of 203 patients met the study criteria, and 203 matched patients without stroke were identified. Median age was 61 years old with stroke and 62 years old without stroke (p = 0.99). In both groups, 82 (39.0%) were women and the median CHA2DS2-VASc was 2 (interquartile range, 1-2). Anticoagulation medication was prescribed to 46 (22.7%) patients in the group who had had a stroke and 52 (25.6%) in the group without stroke (p = 0.49). On Cox regression analysis, CAC was associated with stroke (hazard ratio [HR], 1.47; 95% CI, 1.10-1.97; p < 0.01) and mortality (adjusted HR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.02-1.95; p = 0.04). CONCLUSION. Patients with AF and incidental CAC depicted on chest CT have an increased risk of stroke and mortality beyond established risk factors.  "

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) as bridge therapy restoring eligibility for liver transplantation in cirrhotic patients.  ;Severe aortic stenosis is a widespread valve disease, constituting a contraindication to organ transplantation due to cardiovascular morbidity and projected mortality. Mortality after conventional surgical aortic valve replacement in cirrhotic patients depends upon the Child-Pugh class. In the past few years, transcatheter aortic valve replacement has progressively become the treatment of choice for high-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis. Here, we report the cases of 3 cirrhotic patients who became eligible for liver transplantation after successful transcatheter aortic valve replacement as bridge therapy.  
Anticipating the management of Streptococcus agalactiae infective endocarditis.  ;A patient who presented after falling out of bed had signs of right-sided stroke, which, after imaging, was suspicious for embolism with cardiac origin. Further investigation revealed a large aortic valve vegetation with mild aortic insufficiency, and the patient eventually developed heart failure requiring surgical intervention. Infective endocarditis is slowly becoming more prevalent, and clinicians should have a high index of suspicion when patients present with common complications of this disease, such as valvular dysfunction, heart failure, or stroke. Early diagnosis has been shown to reduce time to appropriate antibiotic treatment and definitive care, which can lead to better outcomes.  
Detection of Myocardial Tissue Alterations in Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Using Texture Analysis of T2-Weighted Short Inversion Time Inversion Recovery Magnetic Resonance Imaging.  ;OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of texture analysis of T2-weighted short inversion time inversion recovery (T2-STIR) for detecting myocardial tissue alterations in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). METHODS: Twenty patients with HCM and 11 controls were examined. Texture analysis was performed for the hypertrophied regions with and without and abnormal hyperintensity (AHI) and for the interventricular septum of the controls on T2-STIR. T2 mapping was performed to measure myocardial T2 values. RESULTS: A gray-level nonuniformity value of 64.7 was the best discriminator between patients and controls with an area under the curve of 0.93 on a receiver operating characteristic curve. T2 values did not differ between them. The gray-level nonuniformity was significantly smaller in AHI regions than in the hypertrophied regions without AHI in HCM patients. CONCLUSIONS: Texture analysis is useful for quantitatively detecting myocardial tissue altenations, including AHI, associated with HCM on T2-STIR.

[Ischemic Mitral Regurgitation: Echocardiographic Algorithm, the Place of Three-Dimensional Transesophageal Echocardiography].  ;"Objective Identify the diagnostic markers of the severe MV changes in patients with ischemic mitral regurgitation (IMR) and suggest a modification of the echocardiography (EchoCG) algorithm.Materials and Methods A two-stage examination of 65 patients with mild (n=22), moderate (n=22), and severe (n=21) IMR was performed using two-dimensional (2D) transthoracic EchoCG with dopplerography, 2D and three-dimensional (3D) transesophageal EchoCG (TEE). 4D MV-Assessment in off-line mode was made in TomTec Imaging Systems GmbH, Germany. Statistical analysis (SAS 9.4) included Student's t-test, Kruskal-Wallis method, Pearson correlation, multivariate regression analysis, and ROC-analysis.Results According to 3D TEE the significant changes in MV annulus, leaflets and tenting are detected. 3D parameters of MV geometry are related to IMR severity, left ventricle (LV) remodeling (global and regional), and they are different in symmetric and asymmetric variants. In symmetric variant MV reconstruction is correlated with LV dilatation and contractility decrease, in asymmetric variant it's correlated with regional remodeling parameters. Severe IMR is characterized by a decrease in MV annulus displacement (27,0±6,6 mm/s versus 32,4±10,8 mm/s in mild IMR; р&lt;0,05), tenting volume fraction (32,5±14,8% versus 56,2±16,8% in mild IMR; p&lt;0,05), and annulus area fraction (4,7±2,7% versus 6,6±4,5% in mild IMR; р&lt;0,05). Vena contracta width (VCW), Proximal Isovelocity Surface Area (PISA) radius, Effective Regurgitant Orifice Area (EROA), Regurgitant Volume (Rvol), LV end systolic dimension (LV ESD), and central large jet &gt;50% of left atrium (LA) area have a predictive value in the diagnosis of MV geometry severe changes. If thresholds are reached these 2D TTE parameters can be used as indications for the 3D TEE.Conclusion 3D TEE allows for detailed assessment of MV geometry and function depended on IMR severity and variant. To make decision of MV surgery 3D TEE is recommended if the following indicators are presented: (1) VCW ≥0,7 cm; PISA radius ≥1,0 cm; central large jet &gt;50% of LA area; LV ESD ≥4,0 cm; (2) VCW ≥0,6 cm; PISA radius = 0,6-0,99 cm; EROA ≥0,3 cm2; RVol≥45 cm; IMR eccentric jet + IMR elliptical orifice.

Kritzmire SM(1), Cossu AE(2).  ;Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) is a type of congenital heart disease that results in the underdevelopment of the left-sided structures of the heart, including the mitral valve, left ventricle, aortic valve, the ascending aorta, and aortic arch. HLHS was first described as a syndrome in 1958 by Nadas and NoonanFontanwho referred to it as combined aortic and mitral atresia. HLHS affects 1 in 5,000 neonates or 3% of all infants born with congenital heart disease. Thirty years ago, there were no treatment options for these neonates, and mortality was 100% within the first week of life. Neonates born with HLHS are dependent on a patent ductus arteriosus and an interatrial communication for survival until surgical intervention. A continuous infusion of prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) is needed to maintain ductal patency.  Today, there are several treatment options available in the prenatal or neonatal period, which include the Norwood procedure, hybrid stage 1, heart transplantation, palliative care, and fetal intervention. A series of three palliative surgical operations (Norwood/Hybrid, Hemi-Fontan/Bidirectional Glenn, and Fontan) are typically necessary for survival beyond the neonatal period and infancy.  Though rare, a diagnosis of HLHS is responsible for 23% of all cardiac deaths in the first week of life.  
Aortic valve microcalcification and cardiovascular risk: an exploratory study using sodium fluoride in high cardiovascular risk patients.  ;"18F-sodium fluoride (18F-NaF) has been used to access aortic stenosis in clinical research setting. It is known that its uptake is related with microcalcification. The purpose of this study was to assess the relationship between 18F-NaF uptake by the aortic valve and cardiovascular risk. Twenty-five patients with risk factors for cardiovascular disease, without known cardiovascular disease or aortic stenosis underwent PET-CT with 18F-NaF. Cardiovascular risk was assessed through the ASCVD (Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease) risk calculator. Aortic valve 18F-NaF (AoVCUL) uptake was evaluated through the corrected uptake per lesion (CUL = max SUV - mean blood-pool SUV). Calcium score was obtained through cardiac CT. The patients present a mean age of 63.90 ± 8.60 years and 56% males. The mean ASCVD was of 28.76 ± 18.96 (M 25, IQR 38.50). The mean aortic valve calcium score (AoVCaSc) was of 53.24 ± 164.38 (M 6; IQR 29.75) and the AoVCUL was of 0.50 ± 0.10 (M 0.52, IQR 0.15). The patients were classified according to the ASCVD: patients with a risk greater or equal than the 50th percentile of the ASCVD risk and patients with a risk lower than the 50th percentile. The AoVCUL was evaluated in both groups: AoVCUL = 0.56 ± 0.10 vs 0.42 ± 0.15, p = 0.02; AoVCaSc was of 0 in 11 patients (44%) and those with an ASCVD greater or equal than the 50th percentile had a mean AoVCaSc of 8.00 ± 13.80, and those with an ASCVD risk lower than the 50th percentile had a mean AoVCaSc of 95.00 ± 223.45; p = 0.09. In this study microcalcification, evaluated through 18F-NaF on PET-CT, was related with cardiovascular risk. Although the score of calcium seems to be higher in higher cardiovascular risk patients, no significant difference was found between groups.  "
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in myosin-binding protein C (MYBPC3) Icelandic founder mutation carriers.  ;"OBJECTIVE: The myosin-binding protein C (MYBPC3) c.927-2A>G founder mutation accounts for >90% of sarcomeric hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) in Iceland. This cross-sectional observational study explored the penetrance and phenotypic burden among carriers of this single, prevalent founder mutation. METHODS: We studied 60 probands with HCM caused by MYBPC3 c.927-2A>G and 225 first-degree relatives. All participants underwent comprehensive clinical evaluation and relatives were genotyped. RESULTS: Genetic and clinical evaluation of relatives identified 49 genotype-positive (G+) relatives with left ventricular hypertrophy (G+/LVH+), 59 G+without LVH (G+/LVH-) and 117 genotype-negative relatives (unaffected). Compared with HCM probands, G+/LVH+ relatives were older at HCM diagnosis, had less LVH, a less prevalent diastolic dysfunction, fewer ECG abnormalities, lower serum N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I levels, and fewer symptoms. The penetrance of HCM was influenced by age and sex; specifically, LVH was present in 39% of G+males but only 9% of G+females under age 40 years (p=0.015), versus 86% and 83%, respectively, after age 60 (p=0.89). G+/LVH- subjects had normal wall thicknesses, diastolic function and NT-proBNP levels, but subtle changes in LV geometry and more ECG abnormalities than their unaffected relatives. CONCLUSIONS: Phenotypic expression of the Icelandic MYBPC3 founder mutation varies by age, sex and proband status. Men are more likely to have LVH at a younger age, and disease manifestations were more prominent in probands than in relatives identified via family screening. G+/LVH- individuals had subtle clinical differences from unaffected relatives well into adulthood, indicating subclinical phenotypic expression of the pathogenic mutation.  "
Utility of balloon aortic valvuloplasty in the transcatheter aortic valve implantation era.  ;"BACKGROUND: Balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV) has seen renewed interest since the advent of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). The study aimed to characterise a contemporary BAV cohort and determinants of clinical outcomes. METHODS: Patients undergoing BAV at a single tertiary centre were retrospectively reviewed over a 10-year period, and functional and mortality outcomes were reported with up to a 2-year follow-up. RESULTS: 224 patients (aged 82.5±8.3 years; 48% female) underwent BAV over the study period. Indications were either destination treatment (39%) or bridge-to-valve replacement (61%)-including bridge-to-decision (29%), symptom relief while on the waitlist (27%), and temporary contraindications to TAVI/aortic valve replacement (AVR) (5%). The mean reduction of aortic mean pressure gradient was 38%. Procedural mortality occurred in 0.5%, stroke in 1.3%, and major bleeding in 0.9%. Twelve-month mortality was 36% overall, and 26% and 50% in the bridging and destination groups, respectively. New York HeartAssociation (NYHA) class improved by ≥1 at 30 days in 50%. Among the bridge-to-TAVI/AVR group, 40% proceeded to TAVI/AVR within 12 months following BAV. In multivariate analysis, active malignancy at baseline (OR: 4.4, 95% CI: 1.3 to 15.1, p=0.02), smoking history (OR: 3.3, 95% CI: 1.3 to 7.9, p<0.01), LVEF ≤30% at baseline (OR: 3.2, 95% CI: 1.3 to 7.6, p<0.01), destination treatment (OR: 2.2, 95% CI: 1.0 to 4.9, p=0.04) were all associated with 12-month mortality. CONCLUSIONS: BAV remains a useful procedure with relatively low rates of complications, however, 1-year mortality rates are high. Contemporary indications for BAV include a bridge to definitive valve replacement or destination treatment.  "

Additive Value of High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol and C-Reactive Protein Level Assessment for Prediction of 2-year Mortality After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.  ;Available prediction models are inaccurate in elderly who underwent transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). The aim of present study was to analyze the separate and combined prognostic values of baseline HDL-C and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in patients treated successfully with TAVI who had complete 2-year follow-up. We analyzed 334 patients treated with TAVI from 01/2010 to 07/2017 who had measurements of HDL-C and CRP on admission or during qualification for the procedure. Baseline HDL-C ≤46 mg/dl (areas under the curve [AUC] = 0.657) and CRP ≥0.20 mg/dl (AUC = 0.634) were predictive of 2-year mortality. After stratification with both cutoffs, patients with low HDL-C and concomitant high CRP most often had LVEF ≤50% and were high risk as per EuroSCORE II. Those with isolated CRP elevation had the lowest frequency of LVEF ≤50%, but more sarcopenia (based on psoas muscle area). After adjustment in the multivariate analysis for other identified predictors including EuroSCORE II and statin therapy, isolated HDL-C ≤46 mg/dl (identified in 40 patients) and isolated CRP ≥0.20 mg/dl (n = 109) were both independent predictors of 2-year mortality (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.92 and HR = 2.42, respectively) compared with patients with both markers within established cutoffs (n = 105) who had the lowest 2-year mortality (9.5%). Patients with both markers exceeding cutoffs (n = 80) had the highest risk (HR = 4.53) with 2-year mortality of 42.5%. High CRP was associated with increased mortality within the first year of follow-up, whereas low HDL-C increased mortality in the second year. The combination of both markers with EuroSCORE II enhanced mortality prediction (AUC = 0.697). In conclusion, low baseline HDL-C and high CRP jointly contribute to the prediction of increased all-cause mortality after TAVI.  
Left Ventricular End-Systolic Dimension and Outcome in Patients With Heart Failure Undergoing Percutaneous MitraClip Valve Repair for Secondary Mitral Regurgitation.  ;Recent MitraClip heart failure (HF) trials suggest that baseline left ventricular (LV) remodeling may be critical for patient selection. We, therefore, investigated whether baseline LV remodeling affects safety, efficacy, and clinical outcomes in HF patients with symptomatic secondary mitral regurgitation (MR) undergoing percutaneous mitral valve repair using MitraClip. LV remodeling was assessed by LV end-systolic dimension index (LVESDi) on transthoracic baseline echocardiography. Early and late outcome was reported using Mitral Valve Academic Research Consortium-criteria. A total of 107 consecutive HF patients (73 ± 10 years, 70% male) who underwent MitraClip intervention for secondary MR were studied. The study population was stratified by median LVESDi between nonadvanced (<28 mm/m², n = 49) and advanced LV remodeling (≥28 mm/m², n = 58). Both groups had similar acute procedural success, in hospital bleeding and nonbleeding complications and significant improvement in MR severity and symptoms, sustained up to 36 months (all p >0.05). LVESDi, but not LV end-diastolic diameter index nor LV ejection fraction, independently related to HF hospitalization (hazard ratio 1.11, 95% confidence interval 1.05 to 1.16, p <0.001) and mortality (hazard ratio 1.11, 95% confidence interval 1.06 to 1.17, p <0.001). At 1 and 3 years, survival free of HF hospitalization was higher in patients without versus with advanced LV remodeling (89% vs 66% and 65% vs 37%, p = 0.002) and mortality was lower (9% vs 24% and 36% vs 47%, p = 0.074), respectively. Annual HF hospitalization rate only decreased in the nonadvanced LV remodeling group (-43%, p = 0.025). Advanced LV remodeling, assessed by LVESDi, in HF patients who underwent MitraClip therapy does not influence therapeutic safety nor efficacy, but implies increased HF hospitalization and mortality risk. This parameter may be valuable for MitraClip therapy patient selection.  
Greater burden of risk factors and less effect of cardiac rehabilitation in elderly with low educational attainment: The Eu-CaRE study.  ;"AIMS: Socioeconomic status is a strong predictor of cardiovascular health. The aim of this study was to describe the immediate and long-term effects of cardiac rehabilitation (CR) across socioeconomic strata in elderly cardiac patients in Europe. METHODS AND RESULTS: The observational EU-CaRE study is a prospective study with eight CR sites in seven European countries. Patients ≥65 years with coronary heart disease or heart valve surgery participating in CR were consecutively included. Data were obtained at baseline, end of CR and at one-year follow up. Educational level as a marker for socioeconomic status was divided into basic, intermediate and high. The primary endpoint was exercise capacity (peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak)). Secondary endpoints were cardiovascular risk factors, medical treatment and scores for depression, anxiety and quality of life (QoL). A total of 1626 patients were included; 28% had basic, 48% intermediate and 24% high education. A total of 1515 and 1448 patients were available for follow-up analyses at end of CR and one-year, respectively. Patients with basic education were older and more often female. At baseline we found a socioeconomic gradient in VO2peak, lifestyle-related cardiovascular risk factors, anxiety, depression and QoL. The socioeconomic gap in VO2peak increased following CR (p for interaction <0.001). The socioeconomic gap in secondary outcomes was unaffected by CR. The use of evidence-based medication was good in all socioeconomic groups. CONCLUSIONS: We found a strong socioeconomic gradient in VO2peak and cardiovascular risk factors that was unaffected or worsened after CR. To address inequity in cardiovascular health, the individual adaption of CR according to socioeconomic needs should be considered.  "
Rapid deployment aortic valve replacement through anterior right thoracotomy: Clinical outcomes and haemodynamic performance.  ;BACKGROUND: The ease of implantation of the rapid deployment (RD) and sutureless valves has contributed to the adoption of anterior right thoracotomy (ART) approach for aortic valve replacement (AVR). AIM OF THE STUDY: This study evaluates the safety and haemodynamic performance of minimally invasive AVR through ART using the RD valves. METHODS: This is a retrospective, single-center review of a total of 50 consecutive patients who received RD-AVR through ART. RESULTS: The median age of patients was 75 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 69-80), and median Euroscore II was 5.1 (IQR: 2.4-7.5). ART RD-AVR was successfully performed in all cases with no conversion to sternotomy, paravalvular leaks or need for valve explantation. The mean size of the implanted valve was 23.2  ± 2.3 mm. In-hospital mortality was 2%. The mean and maximum pressure gradients across the aortic prosthesis were 10 mm Hg (IQR: 9-12) and 19 mm Hg (IQR: 16-23). CONCLUSIONS: Rapid deployment aortic valve replacement can be safely performed through anterior right thoracotomy wit excellent haemodynamic performance and low postoperative complications rate.

Contemporary use of balloon aortic valvuloplasty and evaluation of its success in different hemodynamic entities of severe aortic valve stenosis.  ;OBJECTIVES: To evaluate outcome assessment of percutaneous balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV) in different flow and gradient patterns of severe aortic stenosis (AS). BACKGROUND: The mean pressure gradient reduction after BAV is an often-used surrogate parameter to evaluate procedural success. The definition of a successful BAV has not been evaluated in different subgroups of severe AS, which were introduced in the latest guidelines on the management of patients with valvular heart disease. METHODS: In this observational study, consecutive patients from July 2009 to March 2018 undergoing BAV were divided into normal-flow high-gradient (NFHG), low-flow low-gradient (LFLG), and paradoxical low-flow low-gradient (pLFLG) AS. Baseline characteristics, hemodynamic, and clinical information were collected and compared. RESULTS: One-hundred-fifty-six patients were grouped into NFHG (n = 68, 43.5%), LFLG (n = 68, 43.5%), and pLFLG (n = 20, 12.8%) AS. Mean age of the study population was 81 years. Cardiogenic shock or refractory heart failure (46.8%) was the most common underlying reasons for BAV. Spearman correlation revealed that the mean pressure gradient reduction, determined by echocardiography, had a moderate correlation with the increase in the aortic valve area (AVA) in patients with NFHG AS (ρ: 0.529, p < .001) but showed no association in patients with LFLG (ρ: 0.017, p = .289) and pLFLG (ρ: 0.030, p = .889) AS. BAV as bridge to surgical or transcatheter aortic valve replacement was possible in 44.2% of patients, with no difference between groups (p = .070). CONCLUSION: The mean pressure gradient reduction might be an adequate surrogate parameter for BAV success in patients with NFHG AS but is not suitable for patients with other hemodynamic entities.  
Current status in decision making to treat acute type A dissection: limited versus extended repair.  ;"Acute type A aortic dissection remains one of the most challenging conditions in aortic surgery. Despite the advancements in the field, the mortality rate still remains high. Though there is a general consensus that the ascending aorta should be replaced, the distal extension of the surgery still remains a controversy. Few surgeons argue for a conservative approach to reduce operative and postoperative morbidity while others considering the problems associated with ""downstream problems"" support an aggressive approach including a frozen elephant trunk. The cohort in the Indian subcontinent and APAC is far different from the western world. Many factors determine the decision for surgery apart from the pathology of the disease. Economy, availability of the suitable prosthesis, the experience of the surgeon, ease of access to the medical facility all contribute to the decision making to treat acute type A dissection.  "
Permanent left bundle branch area pacing in a child with a third-degree atrioventricular block: A case report.  ;Permanent left bundle branch area pacing (LBBP) is a promising physiological pacing technique that has emerged in recent years. However, LBBP is almost exclusively clinically applied in adult patients. The feasibility and safety of the use of LBBP in children have not been well-assessed. Here, we report the case of a 6-year-old child with a third-degree atrioventricular block after surgical aortic valve replacement who successfully received a permanent LBBP.

Comparison of different imaging modalities for the quantification of tricuspid valve geometry and regurgitation: a retrospective, single-center study.  ;"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is a frequent valvular heart disease with relevant adverse impact on patients' prognosis. Adequate TR imaging and evaluation is challenging. In this study, we aimed to compare different imaging modalities (echocardiography and multi-slice computed tomography) for the assessment of tricuspid valve (TV) function and geometry. METHODS: We retrospectively investigated patients that presented to University Hospital Bonn, Germany, between September 2018 and March 2019, who underwent comprehensive echocardiography and multi-slice computed tomography (MSCT) to evaluate TR. MSCT was considered the reference approach for dimensional assessment of TV anatomy and echocardiography (transthoracic echocardiography + transesophageal echocardiography) for functional assessment of TV. We used Spearman's Rank order correlation, Bland-Altman analysis, and intra-class correlation to compare the different imaging modalities. RESULTS: Forty patients (Mean Age ± SD: 77.5 ± 7.1 years; 35% female) with high grade TR (effective regurgitant orifice area, EROA: 0.49 ± 0.3 cm2, RegVol: 49.5 ± 13.4 mL) were included. There was a statistically significant but moderate correlation between 2D-TEE and MSCT for anteroposterior (AP) (r = 0.68, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.44-0.93, P = .05; intraclass correlation [ICC]: 0.77, P = .03) and septolateral (SL) diameters (r = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.33-0.93, P = .03; ICC = 0.76, P = .05). MSCT and 3D-TEE showed a strong correlation for determination of TV annulus area (r = 0.94, 95% CI: 0.57-0.98, P = .002; ICC = 0.95, P = .4), perimeter (r = 0.9, 95% CI: 0.6-0.98, P = .002; ICC = 0.97, P = .3) and diameters (AP-Diameter: r = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.06-0.94, P = .03; ICC = 0.83, P = .09; SL-Diameter: r = 0.86, 95% CI: 0.47-0.97, P = .02; ICC = 0.95, P = .1). Only 3D-TEE allowed for direct measurement of planimetric EROA, which exhibited a significant difference from calculated EROA (0.49 ± 0.4 cm2, 0.67 ± 0.17 cm2, P = .05; r = 0.93, 95% CI: 0.5 to 0.99, P = .006). According to Bland-Altman analysis, we found a relevant agreement between MSCT and 3D-TEE only for TV area (bias: -1.95, 95% limits of agreement -3.6 to -0.1). CONCLUSION: Only 3D-TEE allowed for sufficient simultaneous functional and dimensional assessment of TR in our cohort.  "
Lipoprotein(a) and Cardiovascular Diseases　- Revisited.  ;Two decades ago, it was recognized that lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) concentrations were elevated in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, the importance of Lp(a) was not strongly established due to a lack of both Lp(a)-lowering therapy and evidence that reducing Lp(a) levels improves CVD risk. Recent advances in clinical and genetic research have revealed the crucial role of Lp(a) in the pathogenesis of CVD. Mendelian randomization studies have shown that Lp(a) concentrations are causal for different CVDs, including coronary artery disease, calcified aortic valve disease, stroke, and heart failure, despite optimal low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) management. Lp(a) consists of apolipoprotein (apo) B100 covalently bound to apoA. Thus, Lp(a) has atherothrombotic traits of both apoB (from LDL) and apoA (thrombo-inflammatory aspects). Although conventional pharmacological therapies, such as statin, niacin, and cholesteryl ester transfer protein, have failed to significantly reduce Lp(a) levels, emerging new therapeutic strategies using proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 inhibitors or antisesnse oligonucleotide technology have shown promising results in effectively lowering Lp(a). In this review we discuss the revisited important role of L(a) and strategies to overcome residual risk in the statin era.  
Right Atrial Conduit Phase Emptying Predicts Risk of Adverse Events in Pediatric Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension.  ;"BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a severe disease associated with a 20% 5-year mortality, often due to right heart failure. Recent studies suggest that compensatory changes in right atrial (RA) function may precede other clinical and echocardiographic evidence of right ventricular dysfunction. No prior prospective study has evaluated the role of RA emptying pattern as a prognostic marker of adverse clinical events in pediatric PAH. OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate whether RA fractional emptying indices will prospectively predict risk of adverse clinical outcomes in pediatric PAH patients. METHODS: Single-center, prospective cohort analysis of 41 patients with idiopathic or heritable PAH and 1:1 age and sex-matched controls with normal echo and electrocardiogram. Right atrial area (RAA) was measured just prior to tricuspid valve opening (RAAmax), at electrical p wave (RAAp), and just after tricuspid valve closing (RAAmin). Right atrial conduit fraction percent (RA cF%) was defined as the percentage of total RAA change happening prior to the electrical p wave = (RAAmax - RAAp)/(RAAmax - RAAmin) ∗ 100. Clinical worsening was analyzed with a predefined composite adverse event outcome. RESULTS: RA measurements were technically feasible in all study participants. The PAH patients (median age 11.9 years) had decreased RA cF% compared with controls (P < .0001), and PAH subjects with lower RA cF% demonstrated higher right ventricular systolic (R = -0.49, P = .019) and end-diastolic (R = -0.52, P = .012) pressure than those with higher RA cF%. Sixteen subjects had a clinical event. Right atrial cF% (hazard ratio = 0.09; P < .001) was highly prognostic for risk of adverse clinical event with area under the curve = 0.90 on receiver operating characteristic curve analysis (median 3.2-year follow-up). CONCLUSIONS: Right atrial conduit phase emptying is significantly altered in pediatric PAH. Within the PAH population, decreased RA cF% was prognostic for risk of clinical worsening. The combination of accuracy and ease of measurement could make RA cF% a clinically useful, noninvasive biomarker of early right heart failure and risk of disease progression in pediatric PAH.  "
Aortic Valve Replacement for Severe Aortic Stenosis Before and During the Era of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.  ;Recent positive results of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVI) in clinical trials have sparked debate on whether TAVI should be first line for all patients with aortic stenosis. However, limited evidence exists on the clinical impact of TAVI on a national level. Using the national inpatient sample (NIS) of hospital discharges in the United States from 2001 to 2016, we evaluated the rate of AVR and associated in-hospital outcomes in pre-TAVI and TAVI era. Hierarchical mixed effect modeling was used to assess for trend and calculate risk adjusted estimates. Annual volume of AVR increased from 49,357 in 2001 to 100,050 in 2016 (103% increase). Compared with the pre-TAVI era, mean annual change in volume of AVR was higher in the TAVI era (+2.9% vs +9.4%, respectively, p <0.001). In contrast, rate of in-hospital mortality decreased from 5.4% in 2001 to 2.7% in 2016 (50% decrease). Compared with the pre-TAVI era, magnitude of mean annual change in mortality was higher in TAVI era (-4.0% vs -6.7%, respectively, p = 0.04). Unlike SAVR for which risk-adjusted rate for most outcomes seems to have plateaued, TAVI demonstrated significant improvement from 2012 to 2016 for mortality (4.6% to 1.8%), acute kidney injury (15.1% to 2.6%) and nonroutine home discharge (63.6% to 44.6%). However, no significant change in the rate of stroke (2.4% to 2.1%) and pacemaker implantation remained high (8.1% to 9.4%). Lastly, median length of stay was shorter for TAVI compared with isolated SAVR (3 vs 8 days, respectively). In conclusion, the adoption of TAVI has led to increase in volume of AVR for severe aortic stenosis in the United States with favorable short-term outcome.

Combined hybrid pulmonary valve placement and atrial septal defect closure: case report and literature review.  ;We report a case of a 15-year-old female who underwent combined hybrid pulmonary valve replacement and transcatheter atrial septal defect device closure, which was performed due to severe volume overload of the right side of the heart secondary to pulmonary regurgitation and atrial septal defect.  
Screening Rheumatic Heart Disease in 1530 New Caledonian Adolescents.  ;BACKGROUND In New Caledonia, a South Pacific archipelago whose inhabitants comprise Melanesians, Europeans/whites, Wallisians, Futunans, Polynesians, and Asians, the prevalence of rheumatic heart disease (RHD) is 0.9% to 1% at ages 9 and 10. It could be higher at the age of 16, but this remains to be verified. METHODS AND RESULTS A total of 1530 Melanesian, Métis, white, Wallisian, Futunan, Polynesian, and Asian adolescents benefited from a transthoracic echocardiogram. Definite or borderline RHD, nonrheumatic valve lesions, congenital heart defects, family and personal history of acute rheumatic fever, and socioeconomic factors were collected. The prevalence of cardiac abnormalities was 8.1%, made up of 4.1% RHD including 2.4% definite and 1.7% borderline RHD, 1.7% nonrheumatic valve lesions, and 2.3% congenital anomalies. In whites and Asians, there were no cases of RHD. RHD was higher in the Wallisian, Futunan, and Polynesian group (7.6%) when compared with Melanesians (5.3%) and Métis (2.9%). The number of nonrheumatic valve lesions was not statistically different in the different ethnicities. The prevalence of RHD was higher in adolescents with a personal history of acute rheumatic fever, in those living in overcrowded conditions, and in those whose parents were unemployed or had low-income occupations, such as the farmers or manual workers. CONCLUSIONS RHD was 4 times higher in adolescents at age 16 than at ages 9 and 10 (4.1% versus 0.9%-1%). No cases of RHD were observed in whites and Asians. The determining factors were history of acute rheumatic fever and socioeconomic factors.  
Aortic valve calcification scoring with computed tomography: impact of iterative reconstruction techniques.  ;"To investigate whether image reconstruction with iterative reconstruction (IR) affects aortic valve calcification (AVC) scoring and likelihood categorization of severe aortic stenosis (AS). In this IRB-approved retrospective study, we included 100 consecutive patients with AS (40 females; mean age 77 ± 10 years; age range: 36-99 years) undergoing CT prior to transcatheter aortic valve replacement. Non-enhanced, electrocardiography-gated CT of the heart was reconstructed with filtered back projection (FBP) and with advanced modeled IR at strength levels 1-5. AVC Agatston scores were calculated and gender-specific cut-off values for AS likelihood categorization were applied according to current European Society of Cardiology recommendations (from unlikely to very likely). Friedman test with post-hoc Bonferroni correction was applied to analyze interval- and ordinal-scaled data. Compared to FBP, each IR strength level produced significantly different AVC Agatston scores (p < 0.001-0.002). Median AVC Agatston score for image reconstruction with FBP was 2527 (IQR: 1711-3663) and decreased with increasing IR strength levels up to 2281 (IQR: 1471-3357) at strength level 5. Likelihood categorization of severe AS was significantly different among image reconstruction algorithms (p < 0.001). Image reconstruction with IR strength level 5 led to a downward shift of likelihood categorization in 28 patients (28%) compared to images reconstructed with FBP. IR significantly impacts AVC scoring with significantly decreasing AVC scores with increasing IR strength levels. This leads to relevant changes in likelihood categorization of patients with severe AS., leading to underestimation of severe AS.  "
Progression of aortic stenosis and echocardiographic criteria for its severity.  ;"AIMS : Guidelines-recommended criteria for identifying severe aortic stenosis (AS) are based on small, homogenous cohorts of patients, leading to potentially inconsistent or missed diagnosis. We used a large cohort of patients with varying degrees of AS to (i) characterize its progression; (ii) evaluate the influence of demographic and echocardiographic variables; and (iii) derive haemodynamically consistent cut-off values. METHODS AND RESULTS : We identified 916 patients with mild to severe AS who had undergone >1 echocardiographic study (N = 2547). For each study, aortic valve area (AVA), peak transaortic velocity (Vmax), and mean pressure gradient (ΔP) were extracted. Annual rates of AVA change were determined by a linear mixed-effects model. To determine the prevalence of inconsistent diagnosis of severe AS, AVA was plotted against ΔP and Vmax, with quadrants defined using guidelines-recommended cut-offs. The rate of AVA change was -0.070 ± 0.003 cm2/year and was more rapid in men than women and in Whites than African Americans. AVA = 1 cm2 corresponded to ΔP = 32 mmHg and Vmax = 3.7 m/s, causing discrepancies in defining severe AS in 480 (19%) and 458 (18%) studies, respectively. Conversely, ΔP = 40 mmHg corresponded to AVA = 0.89 cm2 and Vmax = 4.0 m/s corresponded to AVA = 0.92 cm2, confirming the inconsistency of the guidelines. Notably, discrepancy rate was higher in 206 patients with low flow (SVi < 35 mL/m2): 40% vs. 16% in the remaining patients. CONCLUSION : Our findings demonstrated gender- and race-related differences in AS progression and underscored the need to refine the multiparametric criteria for diagnosis of severe AS to minimize internal inconsistencies, which are high with the current cut-offs and amplified in patients with low stroke volumes.

Depth of Coaptation: The Key to Long-term Valve Performance?  ;"Comment on Ann Thorac Surg. 2020 Sep;110(3):969-978.  "
Clinical outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in nonagenarians from the optimized catheter valvular intervention-TAVI registry.  ;"OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to investigate 30-day and 2-year clinical outcomes, and predictors of 2-year mortality in nonagenarians undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). BACKGROUND: TAVI has been applied to nonagenarians. However, sufficient clinical data in nonagenarians who could benefit from TAVI are limited. METHODS: We evaluated the data from the optimized catheter valvular intervention-TAVI registry. Clinical outcomes were compared between patients' age ≥90 years and age <90 years. Predictive factors of 2-year mortality were assessed by multivariable Cox regression analyses. RESULTS: From October 2013 to May 2017, a total of 375 nonagenarians (age ≥90 years) and 2,213 younger patients (age <90 years) were included. Although nonagenarians had a higher surgical risk score, 30-day clinical outcomes were similar between two groups. There were no significant differences in 2-year mortality (22.0% vs. 17.3%; p = .11) and stroke (5.5% vs. 3.9%; p = .31); however, 2-year heart failure readmission was higher in nonagenarians (13.3% vs. 9.0%; p = .03). After adjusting covariates, age ≥90 years was not independent predictor for 2-year outcomes. In nonagenarians, female sex (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.43; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.26-0.74; p = .002), chronic kidney disease grade ≥4 (HR = 2.14; 95% CI = 1.21-3.64; p = .01), and Clinical Frailty Scale ≥4 (HR = 1.82; 95% CI = 1.02-3.42; p = .04) were independently associated with 2-year mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical outcomes of TAVI in selected nonagenarians were favorable. Severe renal dysfunction and frailty may be important factors to predict mid-term mortality after TAVI in nonagenarians.  "

Incidence and outcome of prosthetic valve endocarditis after transcatheter aortic valve replacement in the Netherlands.  ;BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is increasingly being used as an alternative to conventional surgical valve replacement. Prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) is a rare but feared complication after TAVR, with reported first-year incidences varying from 0.57 to 3.1%. This study was performed to gain insight into the incidence and outcome of PVE after TAVR in the Netherlands. METHODS: A multicentre retrospective registry study was performed. All patients who underwent TAVR in the period 2010-2017 were screened for the diagnosis of infective endocarditis in the insurance database and checked for the presence of PVE before analysis of general characteristics, PVE parameters and outcome. RESULTS: A total of 3968 patients who underwent TAVR were screened for PVE. During a median follow-up of 33.5 months (interquartile range (IQR) 22.8-45.8), 16 patients suffered from PVE (0.4%), with a median time to onset of 177 days (IQR 67.8-721.3). First-year incidence was 0.24%, and the overall incidence rate was 0.14 events per 1000 person-years. Overall mortality during follow-up in our study was 31%, of which 25% occurred in hospital. All patients were treated conservatively with intravenous antibiotics alone, and none underwent a re-intervention. Other complications of PVE occurred in 5 patients (31%) and included aortic abscess (2), decompensated heart failure (2) and cerebral embolisation (1). CONCLUSION: PVE in patients receiving TAVR is a relatively rare complication and has a high mortality rate.  
Prognostic factors associated with postoperative adverse outcomes in patients with aortic valve prolapse.  ;BACKGROUND AND AIM: Aortic valve (AV) cusp prolapse and subsequent aortic insufficiency (AI) are 2 of factors leading to left ventricular (LV) enlargement and decreased LV function. Aortic valve replacement (AVR) has been the standard surgical procedure for AI. However, few data is available on the prognosis of these patients undergoing AVR procedure, especially in Chinese population. The study aims to evaluate the potential risk factors affecting the mid-term adverse outcomes after AVR. METHODS: One hundred thirty-four patients (mean age: 46.7 years old) with AV cusp prolapse and severe AI who all received surgical aortic valve replacement were recruited in our hospital between January 1, 2009 and December 30, 2017. The clinical characteristics, echocardiography parameters, as well as operative parameters were obtained. The primary endpoint included death, heart failure development, and reoperation. RESULTS: There were 14 adverse events altogether with the primary endpoint during a median follow-up of 8.6 (6-10) months. The multivariable Cox regression analysis revealed that baseline LVEDD (hazard rate, HR = 1.08, 95% CI: 1.01-1.15, P = .021), moderate pulmonary hypertension (HR = 9.36, 95% CI: 1.81-48.28, P = .008), and the time of assisted mechanical ventilation (HR = 1.01, 95% CI: 1.00-1.01, P = .022) were independently associated with the primary endpoint. Kaplan-Meier survival curve showed a significant worse survival free of the endpoint for patients with LVEDD≥70 mm, indexed LVEDD≥37.3 mm/m (the mean in this study), indexed LVESD≥25 mm/m or baseline LVEF <50% (all P<.05). CONCLUSION: Baseline enlarged LV dimensions, low LV function, moderate pulmonary hypertension, and prolonged assisted mechanical ventilation may predict the poor mid-term postoperative outcomes for AV cusp prolapse patients undergoing AVR procedure.  
Acute circumflex occlusion after a successful mitral valve repair.  ;We herein present an interesting case of acute iatrogenic coronary artery occlusion after a successful mini mitral valve repair in a young patient with Barlow's disease. It was successfully managed with percutaneous coronary intervention. This is a well-recognized complication of mitral valve surgery and is often misdiagnosed or late recognized. Implementation of non-invasive and intracoronary imaging is pivotal in-patient management.  
Impact of balloon mitral valvuloplasty on left ventricular rotational deformation: Magnetic Resonance Imaging follow up study.  ;In patients with rheumatic mitral stenosis (MS), some previous studies have investigated the influence of balloon mitral valvuloplasty (BMV) on left ventricular (LV) systolic function. However, the impact of BMV on LV twisting motion in this clinical setting has not been studied before yet. To describe changes in LV torsion in patients with rheumatic MS following BMV. Thirty patients (median age 33 years, 22 women) with isolated severe MS were studied. CMR myocardial tissue tagging was used for assessment of LV rotational deformation. LV torsion was calculated as the twist value (the net difference between apical counterclockwise and basal clockwise rotation) normalized to the length of the ventricle and multiplied by the mean radius at the base and apex. All patients had CMR studies before, 6 months and 1 year after successful BMV. At baseline, patients had a mitral valve area of 0.9 (0.6-1.3) cm2, mean pressure gradient of 12.5 (8-24) mmHg across the valve as measured by transthoracic echocardiography. Median LV ejection fraction (LVEF) estimated by CMR was 57 (range: 45-69) %. A significant improvement in LV base-apex torsion was shown at 6 months (3.3° vs. 2.5°, p < 0.001) with a further improvement at 1 year (4.1° vs. 3.3°, p = 0.05). Similar pattern of change was seen in LV base-mid torsion with a significant increase at 6 months (3.6° vs. 2.3°, p < 0.001) and a further increase at 1 year (4.7° vs. 3.6°, p = 0.007). These changes were associated with a significant increase in LVEF (62% vs. 57%, p < 0.001) at 1 year following BMV. Successful BMV is associated with a significant improvement in LV torsion that is accompanied by a significant improvement in LVEF.  
Asporin Reduces Adult Aortic Valve Interstitial Cell Mineralization Induced by Osteogenic Media and Wnt Signaling Manipulation In Vitro.  ;Worldwide, calcific aortic valve disease is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality among patients with cardiac abnormalities. Aortic valve mineralization and calcification are the key events of adult calcific aortic valve disease manifestation and functional insufficiency. Due to heavy mineralization and calcification, adult aortic valvular cusps show disorganized and dispersed stratification concomitant with deposition of calcific nodules with severely compromised adult valve function. Interestingly, shared gene regulatory pathways are identified between bone-forming cells and heart valve cells during development. Asporin, a small leucine-rich proteoglycan (43 kDa), acts to inhibit mineralization in periodontal ligament cells and is also detected in normal murine adult aortic valve leaflets with unknown function. Therefore, to understand the Asporin function in aortic cusp mineralization and calcification, adult avian aortic valvular interstitial cell culture system is established and osteogenesis has been induced in these cells successfully. Upon induction of osteogenesis, reduced expression of Asporin mRNA and increased expression of bone and osteogenesis markers are detected compared to cells maintained without osteogenic induction. Importantly, treatment with human recombinant Asporin protein reduces the mineralization level in osteogenic media-induced aortic valvular interstitial cells with the concomitant decreased level of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Overall, all these data are highly indicative that Asporin might be a novel biomolecular target to treat patients of calcific aortic valve disease over current cusp replacement surgery.

Effect of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation on Renal Function in Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease.  ;"Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) theoretically increases cardiac output and renal blood flow, and renal function (RF) recovers in patients with severe aortic valve stenosis (AS). However, procedural steps of TAVI including contrast use potentially damage RF. Data describing RF improvements after TAVI in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are lacking. We aimed to determine preoperative predictors of RF improvement after TAVI in severe AS patients with CKD. This observational study included 121 consecutive patients with severe AS and CKD (grade ≥3) who underwent TAVI. The patients were grouped according to their RF improvement after TAVI that was defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) increase ≥10% at discharge from their preoperative level. Sixty-five patients' (54%) RF improved after TAVI. Patients with lower preoperative eGFR tended to achieve greater eGFR increases after TAVI (r = -0.17, p = 0.059). After adjustments for the factors that were significant in the univariate analysis, the preoperative mean transaortic pressure gradient (TAPG) (adjusted odds ratio, 1.03; 95% confidence interval, 1.00 to 1.07) and E/e' (adjusted odds ratio, 0.93; 95% confidence interval, 0.88 to 0.99) independently predicted RF improvement. The cut-off values for the preoperative mean TAPG and E/e' for an RF improvement after TAVI were 47.0 mm Hg and 13.8, respectively. In conclusion, preoperatively, a high mean TAPG and a low E/e' could predict RF improvement after TAVI in patients with CKD.  "

Priorities for Patient-Centered Research in Valvular Heart Disease: A Report From the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Working Group.  ;"Over the past decade, the field of valvular heart disease (VHD) has rapidly transformed, largely as a result of the development and improvement of less invasive transcatheter approaches to valve repair or replacement. This transformation has been supported by numerous well-designed randomized trials, but they have centered almost entirely on devices and procedures. Outside this scope of focus, however, myriad aspects of therapy and management for patients with VHD have either no guidelines or recommendations based only on expert opinion and observational studies. Further, research in VHD has often failed to engage patients to inform study design and identify research questions of greatest importance and relevance from a patient perspective. Accordingly, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute convened a Working Group on Patient-Centered Research in Valvular Heart Disease, composed of clinician and research experts and patient advocacy experts to identify gaps and barriers to research in VHD and identify research priorities. While recognizing that important research remains to be done to test the safety and efficacy of devices and procedures to treat VHD, we intentionally focused less attention on these areas of research as they are more commonly pursued and supported by industry. Herein, we present the patient-centered research gaps, barriers, and priorities in VHD and organized our report according to the ""patient journey,"" including access to care, screening and diagnosis, preprocedure therapy and management, decision making when a procedure is contemplated (clinician and patient perspectives), and postprocedure therapy and management. It is hoped that this report will foster collaboration among diverse stakeholders and highlight for funding bodies the pressing patient-centered research gaps, opportunities, and priorities in VHD in order to produce impactful patient-centered research that will inform and improve patient-centered policy and care.

Marfan Syndrome Versus Bicuspid Aortic Valve Disease: Comparative Analysis of Obstetric Outcome and Pregnancy-Associated Immediate and Long-Term Aortic Complications.  ;"Pregnancy poses a threat to women with aortopathy. Conclusive data on the obstetric and aortic outcome in this risk collective, especially when it comes to aortic complications in the long term, are still missing. This study offers a comparative analysis of pregnancy-associated outcome in 113 consecutive women with Marfan syndrome or bicuspid aortic valve disease, including 46 ever-pregnant and 37 never-pregnant women with Marfan syndrome, and 23 ever-pregnant and 7 never-pregnant females with bicuspid aortic valve disease. The overall obstetric outcome was comparable between ever-pregnant women with Marfan syndrome and with bicuspid aortic valve disease (p = 0.112). Pregnancy-associated aortic dissection occurred in two women with Marfan syndrome (3%) during a total of 62 completed pregnancies, whereas no single case of aortic event occurred in women with bicuspid aortic valve disease during a total of 36 completed pregnancies (p = 0.530). In the long-term follow-up, aortic dissection occurred in 21% of ever-pregnant women with Marfan syndrome, but in none of the women with bicuspid aortic valve disease (p = 0.022). Proximal aortic surgery was performed with similar frequency in ever-pregnant women with Marfan syndrome and with bicuspid aortic valve disease in the long term (p = 0.252). However, ever-pregnant women with Marfan syndrome were younger when surgery was performed (44 ± 9 vs. 59 ± 7 years; p = 0.041). In Marfan syndrome, long-term growth of the aorta was comparable between ever-pregnant and never-pregnant women. Pregnancy thus exhibited an increased immediate aortic risk only in women with Marfan syndrome, but not in women with bicuspid aortic valve disease. Previous pregnancy did not relate to an increased long-term risk of adverse aortic events in women with Marfan syndrome or with bicuspid aortic valve disease.  "
New Technique in Assessment of Heart Chambers Remodeling in Acquired Mitral Valve Defects.  ;OBJECTIVE: Analysis and presentation of the capabilities of the new ultrasound technique -the index of volume remodeling (IRV), which allows comprehensive assessing of pathological remodeling of the heart as an integrated functional anatomical system. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For this study 316 patients with acquired mitral valve disease (MVD) were examined prior to and following mitral valve replacement with bileaflet, disc-, and bioprostheses. Key parameters of the heart were measured in classical echocardiographic projections (end systolic area, end-diastolic area, end systolic volume, and end diastolic volume of ventricles, ventricular ejection fraction, atrial volume, and the ratio of ventricular to atrial volumes). The patients were examined 1-2 days prior to and following the surgery-before discharge, 6 months later, 1 year later, and then annually within next 5 years. The examination data were collected in one- and two-dimensional modes by using Philips EpiQ-7, iE33, HDI, Siemens Acuson, and HP Sonos 2500 diagnostic ultrasound machines equipped with 2.5 and 3.5 MHz transthoracic sensors. RESULTS: A comprehensive study of structural geometric remodeling parameters of heart cavities in the context of acquired MVD allowed identifying new patterns in changes of the heart chambers geometry. These changes are reflected in the IRV, a digital indicator of the severity of cardiac pathological remodeling. Analysis of the dynamics of post-operative vs. pre-operative IRV-based remodeling data also showed that the index is highly sensible to the hemodynamic features of through-flows in various designs of prostheses. The IRV has a pronounced prognostic power and allows predicting the long-term outcome of surgical treatment with an accuracy of 82.35%. CONCLUSIONS: The IRV predictive accuracy formed the basis of the original classification of types of cardiac remodeling, which can assist both in determining the optimal timing for surgery, and in conjunction with other clinical diagnostic data, in predicting the long-term outcome of heart geometry restoration depending on the type of surgical correction. The IRV can be used in evaluation of the heart geometry for any cardiac pathology. It makes the approach to the analysis of pathological remodeling of the heart understandable, consistent, and universal, and also opens up opportunities for further expanding the diagnostic capabilities of radiology in cardiac surgery at all stages of the diagnostic process.  
Aerococcus urinae - A potent biofilm builder in endocarditis.  ;The diagnosis of infective endocarditis (IE) remains a challenge. One of the rare bacterial species recently associated with biofilms and negative cultures in infective endocarditis is Aerococcus urinae. Whether the low number of reported cases might be due to lack of awareness and misidentification, mainly as streptococci, is currently being discussed. To verify the relevance and biofilm potential of Aerococcus in endocarditis, we used fluorescence in situ hybridization to visualize the microorganisms within the heart valve tissue. We designed and optimized a specific FISH probe (AURI) for in situ visualization and identification of A. urinae in sections of heart valves from two IE patients whose 16S rRNA gene sequencing had deteced A. urinae. Both patients had a history of urinary tract infections. FISH visualized impressive in vivo grown biofilms in IE, thus confirming the potential of A. urinae as a biofilm pathogen. In both cases, FISH/PCR was the only method to unequivocally identify A. urinae as the only causative pathogen for IE. The specific FISH assay for A. urinae is now available for further application in research and diagnostics. A. urinae should be considered in endocarditis patients with a history of urinary tract infections. These findings support the biofilm potential of A. urinae as a virulence factor and are meant to raise the awareness of this pathogen.

Obstructive bioprosthetic mitral valve thrombosis.  ;Bioprosthetic valve thrombosis (BPVT) is not uncommon but can be under diagnosed due to the lack of awareness and technical limitations of echocardiography. When suspecting BPVT, it is imperative to consider multimodality imaging to establish the diagnosis as early treatment can alter the clinical course. Here we present a case series of two patients with a history of rheumatic heart disease status post bioprosthetic mitral valve replacement who presented with acute heart failure symptoms. In both cases, supplemental imaging with real-time 3D echocardiography was critical in establishing a diagnosis of BPVT, resulting in timely treatment. These cases support updating current guidelines for the management of patients with bioprosthetic valve replacement to include more frequent surveillance imaging even if patients are asymptomatic.  
ADAMTS19-associated heart valve defects: Novel genetic variants consolidating a recognizable cardiac phenotype.  ;Recently, ADAMTS19 was identified as a novel causative gene for autosomal recessive heart valve disease (HVD), affecting mainly the aortic and pulmonary valves. Exome sequencing and data repository (CentoMD) analyses were performed to identify patients with ADAMTS19 variants (two families). A third family was recognized based on cardiac phenotypic similarities and SNP array homozygosity. Three novel loss of function (LoF) variants were identified in six patients from three families. Clinically, all patients presented anomalies of the aortic/pulmonary valves, which included thickening of valve leaflets, stenosis and insufficiency. Three patients had (recurrent) subaortic membrane, suggesting that ADAMTS19 is the first gene identified related to discrete subaortic stenosis. One case presented a bi-commissural pulmonary valve. All patients displayed some degree of atrioventricular valve insufficiency. Other cardiac anomalies included atrial/ventricular septal defects, persistent ductus arteriosus, and mild dilated ascending aorta. Our findings confirm that biallelic LoF variants in ADAMTS19 are causative of a specific and recognizable cardiac phenotype. We recommend considering ADAMTS19 genetic testing in all patients with multiple semilunar valve abnormalities, particularly in the presence of subaortic membrane. ADAMTS19 screening in patients with semilunar valve abnormalities is needed to estimate the frequency of the HVD related phenotype, which might be not so rare.  
A smaller heart-aorta-angle associates with ascending aortic dilatation and increases wall shear stress.  ;"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the orientation of the heart, measured as an angle between the long axis of the heart and ascending aorta midline (heart-aorta-angle, HAA), associates with ascending aortic (AA) dilatation. Furthermore, the association between HAA and wall shear stress (WSS) was studied. METHODS: HAA was retrospectively measured in 1000 consecutive coronary artery computed tomographic angiography (CCTA) images in patients with low-to-moderate pretest probability for coronary artery disease (CAD). To evaluate the effects of HAA on AA flow, 4D flow MRI was performed for 28 patients with AA dilatation (> 40 mm) and WSS was analyzed. RESULTS: The mean age of patients undergoing CCTA was 52.9 ± 9.8 years; 66.5% were women. Their median HAA was 128.7° and interquartile range 123.3-134.1°. HAA was significantly smaller in patients with dilated AA (median 126.7° [121.3-130.8°]) compared with the patients with normal AA (median 129.5° [124.3-135.3°], p < 0.001). HAA was smaller in males (p < 0.001) and in patients with diabetes (p = 0.016), hypertension (p = 0.001), CAD (p = 0.003), hypercholesterolemia (p < 0.001), and bicuspid aortic valve (p = 0.025) than without these factors. In a subpopulation without any of these underlying diseases (n = 233), HAA was still significantly smaller in the patients with dilated AA (median 127.9° [124.3-134.3°]) compared with patients with normal AA (median 131.9° [127.6-136.9°], p = 0.013). In 4D flow MRI, a smaller HAA correlated with increased total WSS in the outer curvature of the proximal AA (r = - 0.510, p = 0.006). CONCLUSION: A smaller HAA associates with AA dilatation and affects the blood flow in the proximal AA. KEY POINTS: • A smaller angle between the long axis of the heart and ascending aorta midline associated with ascending aortic dilatation. • A smaller heart-aorta-angle correlated with increased total wall shear stress in the outer curvature of the proximal ascending aorta.

Features of heritable disorders of connective tissue in children with acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease.  ;OBJECTIVES: Heritable disorders of connective tissue (HDCT) are associated with morphological and functional disorders of different organs and systems. The aim of our study was to determine the clinical signs of heritable disorders of connective tissue and oxyproline levels in children with acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and rheumatic heart disease (RHD). MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 155 patients aged 4 to 17 years participated in the study: 23 with ARF, 78 with RHD, and 54 healthy patients with a history of ARF. All patients underwent a standardized examination protocol, which consisted of a detailed medical history recorded by the physician, general and special laboratory tests, electrocardiogram, echocardiography, and Doppler echocardiography. Special attention was paid to the clinical signs of HDCT. The intensity of the metabolic processes in the connective tissue was evaluated by serum oxyproline levels. RESULTS: The signs of HDCT were revealed in 121 (78.1%) of the patients with ARF and RHD. Among cardiovascular manifestations, we observed mitral valve prolapse most often - in 91 (58.7%) patients. Musculoskeletal anomalies were observed in 94 (60.7%) patients. Both groups of patients with ARF and RHD had elevated mean serum oxyproline levels. CONCLUSIONS: Children with acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease presented with a number of signs characteristic of heritable connective tissue disorders. The cardiovascular and musculoskeletal system changes are the most frequent among all features of HDCT. Elevated levels of serum oxyproline in patients with ARF and RHD confirm connective tissue disorders. Children with manifestations of HDCT are at the risk of ARF and RHD development.  
"Mitral valve replacement in mitral stenosis; the problem of small left ventricle.  ";"BACKGROUND: Mitral valve stenosis in adults especially due to rheumatic heart disease may be associated with a smaller than normal left ventricular cavity. Mitral valve replacement in such cases may lead to hemodynamic instability either during weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass or in the early postoperative period manifested by the need for inotropic support and even mortality due to low cardiac output syndrome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 184 patients with predominately severe stenotic mitral valves who underwent elective isolated mitral valve replacement in the period between January 2012 and January 2018 at our hospital were included in this study. Patients were divided into 2 matched groups; (small LV group) consisting of 86 cases and (normal or dilated LV group) consisting of 98 cases. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences in operative details among both groups apart from the need for inotropic support and intra-aortic balloon pump due to low cardiac output which were statistically significantly higher in (small LV group) than (normal or dilated LV group) with a p-values of 0.01 and 0.03 respectively. Within the ICU stay only the incidence of occurrence of heart failure was significantly higher in (small LV group) with a p-value of 0.008. No statistically significant difference could be elicited in the in-hospital mortality between both groups (p-value = 0.1). CONCLUSION: Patients with mitral valve stenosis and small left ventricular cavity are in a higher need for inotropic and even mechanical support after mitral valve replacement as well as at a higher risk for the development of heart failure before hospital discharge than patients with mitral stenosis and normal-sized left ventricular cavity.

The role of 18FDG PET/CT in the assessment of endocarditis, myocarditis and pericarditis.  ;"BACKGROUND: Endocarditis, myocarditis and pericarditis are a heterogeneous group of phenotypic syndromes where the culprit area of inflammation is the heart. Inflammation may be determined by an infective agent, toxins, drugs or an activated immune system. Clinical manifestations can be subtle and diagnosis remains a challenge for cardiologists, requires high level of suspicion and advanced multimodal cardiac imaging to avoid life-threatening consequences. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this review is to report the recent advances of PET/CT imaging with 18FDG in helping the management of patients affected by inflammatory heart disease. METHODS: Two independent reviewers searched in PubMed articles published before or on June 2019 and final decisions on the inclusion of references were done in consensus with a third reviewer. At the end of the selection process were included 23/206 articles on ""cardiac inflammation""; 26/235 articles on ""endocarditis"", ""prosthetic heart valve"", ""pacemaker"", ""implantable cardiac device""; 7/103 articles on ""myocarditis""; 13/330 articles on sarcoidosis"" and 2/19 articles on ""pericarditis"". CONCLUSION: Compared with conventional methods, molecular imaging has the advantage to noninvasively and directly trace the inflammatory process, and to early identify the presence and the extent of intra-cardiac and extra-cardiac involvement, to enable quantification of disease activity, guide therapeutic interventions, and monitor treatment success.

On-Pump vs Off-Pump coronary artery bypass surgery in atrial fibrillation. Analysis from the polish national registry of cardiac surgery procedures (KROK).  ;"BACKGROUND: No single randomized study has ever before addressed the safety of On-Pump coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) vs Off-Pump CABG in the setting of atrial fibrillation (AF) and data from small observational samples remain inconclusive. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Procedural data from KROK (Polish National Registry of Cardiac Surgery Procedures) were retrospectively collected. Of initial 188,972 patients undergoing CABG, 7,913 presented with baseline AF (76.0% men, mean age 69.1±8.2) and underwent CABG without concomitant valve surgery between 2006-2019 in 37 reference centers across Poland. Mean follow-up was 4.7±3.5 years (median 4.3 IQR 1.7-7.4). Cox proportional hazards models were used for computations. Of included patients, 3,681 underwent On-Pump- (46.52%) as compared to 4,232 (53.48%) who underwent Off-Pump CABG. Patients in the latter group less frequently were candidates for complete revascularization (P<0.001). In an unadjusted comparison, On-Pump surgery was associated with significantly worse survival at 30 days: HR: 1.28; 95%CIs: (1.07-1.53); P = 0.007. Along the 13-year study period, the trend shifted in favor of On-Pump CABG: HR: 0.92; 95%CIs: (0.83-0.99); P = 0.005. After rigorous propensity matching, 636 pairs were identified. The direction and magnitude of treatment effects was sustained with HRs of 3.58; (95%CIs: 1.34-9.61); p = 0.001 and 0.74; [95%CIs: 0.56-0.98]; p = 0.036) for 30-day and late mortality respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Off-Pump CABG offered 30-day survival benefit to patients undergoing CABG surgery and presenting with underlying AF. On-Pump CABG was associated with significantly improved survival at long term.  "
Bench to bedside defining calcific aortic valve disease: osteocardiology.  ;INTRODUCTION: For years, calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) was thought to be due to a degenerative process, but recent scientific discoveries have proven it to be an active process. Understanding the cellular mechanisms for the development of disease and translating the cellular changes critical in the development of calcific phenotypes. The use of multimodality imaging has been the gold standard to define the development of calcification to determine the timing of therapy. AREAS COVERED: This review will discuss the scientific literature in a new and evolving field known as osteocardiology, which specifically defines the cellular mechanisms involved in the development of the osteogenic phenotype in the heart and vasculature. The work in this field has been highlighted by the calcific aortic valve disease working group at the NIH. This review will discuss the appropriate use criteria for multimodality imaging techniques to identify early cellular and hemodynamic disease progression in the aortic valve to help determine the timing of therapy, the osteocardiology theory. EXPERT OPINION: The authors will provide their background in basic science and clinical medicine to support the opinions in this paper.

Non-contrast MRI protocol for TAVI guidance: quiescent-interval single-shot angiography in comparison with contrast-enhanced CT.  ;"OBJECTIVES: To prospectively compare unenhanced quiescent-interval single-shot MR angiography (QISS-MRA) with contrast-enhanced computed tomography angiography (CTA) for contrast-free guidance in transcatheter aortic valve intervention (TAVI). METHODS: Twenty-six patients (mean age 83 ± 5 years, 15 female [58%]) referred for TAVI evaluation underwent QISS-MRA for aortoiliofemoral access guidance and non-contrast three-dimensional (3D) ""whole heart"" MRI for prosthesis sizing on a 1.5-T system. Contrast-enhanced CTA was performed as imaging gold standard for TAVI planning. Image quality was assessed by a 4-point Likert scale; continuous MRA and CTA measurements were compared with regression and Bland-Altman analyses. RESULTS: QISS-MRA and CTA-based measurements of aortoiliofemoral vessel diameters correlated moderately to very strong (r = 0.572 to 0.851, all p ≤ 0.002) with good to excellent inter-observer reliability (intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0.862 to 0.999, all p < 0.0001) regarding QISS assessment. Mean diameters of the infrarenal aorta and iliofemoral vessels differed significantly (bias 0.37 to 0.98 mm, p = 0.041 to < 0.0001) between the two modalities. However, inter-method decision for transfemoral access route was comparable (κ = 0.866, p < 0.0001). Aortic root parameters assessed by 3D whole heart MRI strongly correlated (r = 0.679 to 0.887, all p ≤ 0.0001) to CTA measurements. CONCLUSION: QISS-MRA provides contrast-free access route evaluation in TAVI patients with moderate to strong correlations compared with CTA and substantial inter-observer agreement. Despite some significant differences in minimal vessel diameters, inter-method agreement for transfemoral accessibility is strong. Combination with 3D whole heart MRI facilitates unenhanced TAVI guidance. KEY POINTS: • QISS-MRA and CTA inter-method agreement for transfemoral approach is strong. • QISS-MRA is a very good alternative to CTA and MRA especially in patients with Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiativestages 4 and 5. • Combination of QISS-MRA and 3D ""whole heart"" MRI facilitates fully unenhanced TAVI guidance.

Role for Vascular Factors in Long-Term Outcomes After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.  ;"Despite major technological advances, 1-year morbi-mortality after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is still high. Further outcome improvements may be obtained provided proper identification of prognostic factors. A change of prognostic value over time should be the hallmark of an outcome-implicated factor. In 1,425 patients treated by TAVI, the examined prognostic factors were: demographic factors and co-morbidities (age, male gender, glomerular filtration rate, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), cardiac function (left ventricular ejection fraction, pulmonary pressure, aortic gradient, dyspnea, and mitral regurgitation), and vascular factors (coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), previous stroke, and thoracic aortic calcium-TAC-as assessed by CT scan). Cox models were used to analyze cardiovascular and all-cause mortalities over 3 years of follow-up. The time-dependent effects of the factors were analyzed using the distribution of Schoenfeld residuals. During the study period, 375 (26.3%) deaths occurred of whom 248 (17.4%) from cardiovascular causes. Only 2 factors associated with cardiovascular or all-cause mortality showed significant changes over time: dyspnea and PVD. The effect of dyspnea on cardiovascular mortality decreased over time (first- and third-year hazard ratios [95% confidence intervals]: 1.47 [1.10; 1.96] and 0.94 [0.55; 1.63], respectively), whereas the effect of PVD increased (first- and third-year hazard ratios: 0.87 [0.56; 1.35] and 2.58 [1.25; 5.33], respectively). TAC had a stable effect. In conclusion, the detrimental effects of vascular factors remained stable (TAC) or increased (PVD) over time. These factors should be targeted by specific measures to improve post-TAVI outcomes.  "
"Case report: early aortic valve degeneration associated with interstitial deletion of chromosome 2-46,XX,del (2)(q31.3; q32.2).  ";BACKGROUND: Interstitial deletions within the long arm of chromosome 2, involving the 2q31q33 region, are rare but are known to be associated with delays in development, behavioral problems, facial dysmorphism and various hand/foot anomalies. CASE PRESENTATION: Here, we describe a case with an interstitial 2q31.3.q32.2 deletion, presenting the previously described phenotype, exhibiting fibromyxoid degeneration of the aortic valve in addition to previously described clinical features. CONCLUSION: Interstitial deletion in chromosome 2q31.2q32.3 might be associated to a fibromyxoid degeneration of valvular leaflets generating regurgitation. Patients diagnosed with this mutation may require investigation to rule out a valvular disease.  
Aortic Valve Replacement by a Transaxillary Anterior Minithoracotomy Approach.  ;A modified transaxillary approach for aortic valve disease to obtain the same exposure as the anterior minithoracotomy approach and to preserve the pectoralis major muscle is presented. When the patient's right shoulder is adducted horizontally, or the right arm is flexed anteriorly 90 degrees and adducted to the left, the right axilla comes close to the chest midline. That means that a right anterior thoracotomy can be made through the right axilla when the arm position is adjusted appropriately. The modified new approach is safe and faster than the conventional transaxillary approach, and it provides cosmetic advantages to the patient.  
Revisiting the Diagnostic Yield of Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Genetic Testing.  ;"Comment on Circ Genom Precis Med. 2020 Apr;13(2):e002748.  "
Transcatheter valve replacement: a revolution.  ;"Degenerative aortic stenosis is the most common valvular disease worldwide; however, its physiopathology remains poorly understood. Although, developments in prevention of this disease have remained relatively stagnant, the last decade has brought about innovative treatment options incorporating different percutaneous and surgical approaches. These advances have allowed physicians to offer relief to high-risk patients, previously deemed nonsurgical. Increasingly, there is a shift toward offering percutaneous valve replacement to moderate and low-risk patients with aortic stenosis. Enthusiasm for a new treatment option must always be tempered by caution; as defining appropriate patient selection is essential to achieve optimal outcomes.  "
Periaortic adipose tissue volume is associated with sclerotic changes in the adjacent aortic valve.  ;Aortic sclerosis is associated with increased cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. Numerous studies have shown that visceral adiposity is associated with development of atherosclerosis, especially in the adjacent vascular wall. Considering the similar pathophysiology of aortic sclerosis and atherosclerosis, it can be hypothesized that visceral adipose tissue adjacent to aortic valve may be associated with aortic sclerosis. In this study, we investigated the relationship between periaortic adipose tissue volume and sclerotic changes in the adjacent aortic valve. In this retrospective study, 80 patients with a concurrent MSCT and echocardiography in the last 6 months were enrolled. Echocardiographic examinations were retrospectively evaluated regarding the presence of aortic sclerosis. Periaortic adipose tissue volume was calculated on a computer assisted work station (Leonardo Workstation, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) by an experienced radiologist. Patient group (61.63 ± 8.55 years and 50% male) and the control group (61.45 ± 5.68 years, 50% male) each consisted 40 participants. Patient group had significantly higher BUN (42.50 (15.00-211.00) vs. 34.00 (12.00-107.00) mg/dL, p = 0.003), uric acid (5.40 (3.40-14.70) vs. 4.30 (2.30-6.70) ng/mL, p = 0.005) and LDL-C levels (121.50 (60.00-215.00) vs. 86.50 (49.00-209.00) mg/dL, p = 0.001) when compared to control group. Patient group had also significantly higher periaortic adipose tissue volume (32.45 (11.70-51.23) vs. 16.00 (6.29-32.96) ml, p < 0.001). Multivariate regression analysis revealed that periaortic adipose tissue volume was independently associated with the presence of aortic sclerosis (OR 0.241, 95% CI 0.143-0.946, p = 0.001). In this study, we demonstrated for the first time that periaortic adipose tissue volume was independently associated with the presence of sclerotic changes in the adjacent aortic valve.  
[Postacute care after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI)].  ;"With increasing age valvular heart disease is among the most frequent diseases of the heart. Relevant valvular disease impairs not only the long-term prognosis but also physical resilience, activities of daily living and the quality of life. In cases of middle to high-grade symptomatic cardiac defects, valve replacement or valve reconstruction is still the surgical procedure of choice; however, in recent years the transcatheter percutaneous aortic valve replacement (TAVI) procedure has become more prominent for the most frequent defect, aortic valve stenosis. This article provides an overview of the aftercare and rehabilitation of patients following a TAVI intervention.  "
Pulmonary Valve Replacement in an Adult Jehovah's Witness with Tetralogy of Fallot.  ;The refusal of Jehovah's Witnesses to use blood products can limit access to cardiac surgery, as patients may not be offered surgery for complex disease, especially revision surgery. We report a successful, complex adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) surgery with intraoperative and perioperative optimization. We have tried to highlight through this case that complex ACHD surgeries can be performed in Jehovah's Witness patients with skilled perioperative and intraoperative management. The role of bovine hemoglobin in this population is being defined and was found helpful in this case.  
Contribution of Severe Dental Caries Induced by Streptococcus mutans to the Pathogenicity of Infective Endocarditis.  ;Streptococcus mutans, a major pathogen of dental caries, is regarded as a causative agent of infective endocarditis (IE), which mainly occurs in patients with underlying heart disease. However, it remains unknown whether severe dental caries that extend to pulp space represent a possible route of infection. In the present study, we evaluated the virulence of S. mutans for IE development using rats with concurrent severe dental caries and heart valve injury. Dental caries was induced in rats through the combination of a caries-inducing diet and the administration of S. mutans into the oral cavity. Then, the heart valves of a subset of rats were injured using a sterile catheter and wire under general anesthesia. The rats were euthanized at various times with various stages of dental caries. The number of teeth affected by dental caries with pulp exposure was increased in the rats in a time-dependent manner. S. mutans was recovered from injured heart tissue, which was mainly observed in rats with higher number of S. mutans bacteria in mandibular bone and a larger number of teeth in which caries extended to pulp. Dental caries was more severe in rats with heart injury than in rats without heart injury. Sequencing analysis targeting 16S rRNA revealed that specific oral bacteria appeared only in rats with heart injury, which may be related to the development of dental caries. Our findings suggest that dental caries caused by the combination of S. mutans infection and sucrose intake may contribute to S. mutans colonization in injured heart tissue.  
Transcatheter aortic valve implantation in the patients with chronic liver disease: A mini-review and meta-analysis.  ;BACKGROUND: Chronic liver disease is traditionally conceived as a risk factor for cardiovascular surgery. Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has recently burgeoned to precede surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in patients with severe aortic stenosis at intermediate to high surgical risk. The evidence regarding TAVI in the patients with chronic liver disease is currently scarce. METHODS: This article aims to assess the application of TAVI technique in the patients with chronic liver disease. RESULTS: TAVI in the patients with chronic liver disease produced acceptable postoperative results. The post-TAVI outcomes were comparable between the patients with or without chronic liver disease, except for a lower rate of pacemaker implantation in the patients with chronic liver disease (OR, 0.49[0.27-0.87], P = .02). In the patients with chronic liver disease, compared to SAVR, TAVI led to a decrease in the in-hospital mortality (OR, 0.43[0.22-0.86], P = .02) and need for transfusion (OR, 0.39[0.25-0.62], P < .0001). The rest outcomes were similar between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review and meta-analysis supported that TAVI is a reliable therapeutic option for treating severe aortic stenosis in the patients with chronic liver disease. Future large-scale randomized controlled trials investigating the mid-term and long-term prognosis are needed to further verify these results.  
When Behcet's disease meets Stanford type A aortic dissection, heart transplantation is a reliable treatment.  ;"Behcet's disease (BD) is an immune system disease characterized by multi-system vascular inflammation. Its occurrence in patients who experience a Stanford type A aortic dissection (AD) is very rare, but extremely dangerous. A 44-year-old male patient was diagnosed with an acute Stanford type A AD and underwent a standard Bentall procedure and total aortic arch replacement plus descending aortic stented elephant trunk implantation. Aortic valve leakage and an aortic root pseudoaneurysm developed 3 months after surgery. At this time, we suspected that this patient had BD. After immunosuppressive treatment, we performed modified Bentall again; however, the heart failure occurred shortly after the second operation. Finally, we successfully treated this patient with a heart transplant. This is the first report of a heart transplant to treat BD with acute Stanford type A AD. In the diagnosis and treatment of acute Stanford type A AD, in addition to the traditional pathogenic factors, we need to be alert to BD, and heart transplantation may be a good way to treat such patients.

Left ventricular response in the transition from hypertrophy to failure recapitulates distinct roles of Akt, β-arrestin-2, and CaMKII in mice with aortic regurgitation.  ;BACKGROUND: Although aortic regurgitation (AR) is a clinically important condition that is becoming increasingly common, few relevant murine models and mechanistic studies exist for this condition. In this study, we attempted to delineate the pathological and molecular changes and address the roles of some potentially relevant molecules in an animal model of surgically induced AR. METHODS: AR was induced by puncturing the aortic valve leaflets in C57BL/6J mice under echocardiographic guidance. RESULTS: As early as 1 week following AR, the left ventricles (LV) displayed marked impairments in diastolic function and coronary flow reserve (CFR), as well as cardiac hypertrophy and chamber dilatation at both end-systole and end-diastole. LV free wall thickening and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in LV were observed 2 weeks following of AR while a decline in ejection fraction was not seen until after 4 weeks. Nppa (natriuretic peptide A) and Nppb (natriuretic peptide B) increased over time, in conjunction with prominent Akt activation as well as slight CaMKII (Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II) activation and biphasic changes in β-arrestin-2 expression. Treatment of AR mice with Akt inhibition exacerbated the eccentric hypertrophy, while neither inhibition of CaMKII nor β-arrestin-2 overexpression influenced the response to AR. CONCLUSIONS: Our structural, functional, molecular and therapeutic analyses reveal that Akt, but not CaMKII or β-arrestin-2, plays a regulatory role in the development of LV remodeling after AR in Mice. These results may shed important light on therapeutic targets for volume overloaded cardiomyopathy.  
Type B Interrupted Aortic Arch with a Patent Ductus Arteriosus in an Adult Presenting with Secondary Polycythaemia.  ;"Interrupted aortic arch (IAA) is an extremely rare congenital cyanotic heart disease characterized by complete disruption between the ascending and descending aorta. A patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) or other collateral pathways provide blood flow to the distal descending aorta. Mortality is extremely high at early infancy, particularly after closure of the ductus arteriosus. Survival and presentation in adulthood are extremely rare. Here, we illustrate a rare case of type B IAA in an adult who presented with secondary polycythaemia. The blood supply to the descending aorta and beyond was almost solely via a PDA. This case demonstrates the value of multimodality imaging, including CT and MRI, for diagnosis and treatment planning in these patients. LEARNING POINTS: The presence of secondary polycythaemia, as a result of chronic hypoxia, should prompt a search for underlying cyanotic heart disease even in previously undiagnosed adults.Most previous case reports of IAA in adults feature type A; type B IAA in an adult is far less frequently described.MRI has incremental value compared to CT in intracardiac assessment (aortic valve assessment, RV and LV functional assessment, flow measurement) for these patients; in addition, it provides an excellent depiction of the vascular anatomy of the aorta and great vessels.

Evaluating the Portability of an NLP System for Processing Echocardiograms: A Retrospective, Multi-site Observational Study.  ;While natural language processing (NLP) of unstructured clinical narratives holds the potential for patient care and clinical research, portability of NLP approaches across multiple sites remains a major challenge. This study investigated the portability of an NLP system developed initially at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to extract 27 key cardiac concepts from free-text or semi-structured echocardiograms from three academic edical centers: Weill Cornell Medicine, Mayo Clinic and Northwestern Medicine. While the NLP system showed high precision and recall easurements for four target concepts (aortic valve regurgitation, left atrium size at end systole, mitral valve regurgitation, tricuspid valve regurgitation) across all sites, we found moderate or poor results for the remaining concepts and the NLP system performance varied between individual sites.  
Molecular mechanisms involved in high glucose-induced valve calcification in a 3D valve model with human valvular cells.  ;Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD)-the most common valvular heart disease-is accelerated in diabetes and has no pharmacotherapy. Although it is known that early CAVD is associated with inflammation and osteogenesis, the molecular mechanisms involved in diabetes-associated CAVD still need to be uncovered. In this context, we have developed a 3D construct based on gelatin populated with human valvular endothelial cells (VEC) and valvular interstitial cells (VIC) and evaluated the effect of high glucose (HG) concentration on osteogenic molecules expression and on calcification mechanisms. First, we characterized the 3D model and assessed VIC remodelling properties at different time-points. Then, we exposed it to normal glucose (NG) or high glucose (HG) for 7, 14 and 21 days after which the cells were isolated, separated and investigated individually. Our results showed that encapsulated VIC actively remodel the hydrogel, as demonstrated by an increased expression of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Moreover, exposure of the construct to HG triggered bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and TGF-β signalling pathways, up-regulating expression of osteogenic molecules-BMP-2/-4, osteocalcin, osteopontin, SMADs and Runt-related transcription factor (Runx-2)-and increased calcium deposits in an osteogenic environment. These findings underline the potential of the developed 3D model as a suitable system to investigate the mechanisms of human CAVD and may help to better understand the calcification mechanisms in CAVD associated to diabetes.

Left Atrial End-Diastolic Volume Index as a Predictor of Cardiovascular Outcomes: The Heart and Soul Study.  ;"BACKGROUND: The left atrial end-systolic volume index (LAESVI) is a predictor of cardiovascular outcomes and is the recommended measurement of left atrial size. The left atrial end-diastolic volume index (LAEDVI), representing the minimum or residual left atrial volume, has not been fully evaluated as a predictor of cardiovascular events. This study evaluated the predictive power of LAEDVI compared with LAESVI for heart failure (HF) hospitalizations, a composite of HF hospitalizations, myocardial infarction, stroke, and heart disease death, and all-cause mortality. METHODS: We measured LAESVI and LAEDVI in subjects without atrial fibrillation or flutter or significant mitral valve disease. Using Cox proportional-hazard models, the association of LAESVI and LAEDVI with the stated outcomes was examined. RESULTS: After a mean of 7.3±2.6 years of follow-up, there were 147 HF hospitalizations, 118 myocardial infarctions, 45 strokes, 96 heart disease deaths, and 351 deaths from all causes in 938 subjects. When comparing the highest and the lowest quartiles of LAEDVI, there was a near 6-fold increase in the hazard ratio (HR) for HF hospitalization (HR, 5.96; P<0.001). This was higher than what was seen with LAESVI (HR, 4.85; P<0.001). Similar associations were noted for the composite cardiovascular outcome (HR for LAEDVI, 2.97; P<0.001) and for all-cause mortality (HR for LAEDVI, 2.08; P<0.001). In adjusted models, LAEDVI demonstrated equal or better predictive power than LAESVI for HF hospitalization and the composite cardiovascular outcome. CONCLUSIONS: LAEDVI is a strong predictor of cardiovascular events in ambulatory patients with stable coronary heart disease and may merit routine use.  "
Comparison of outcomes between minimally invasive and median sternotomy for double and triple valve surgery: A meta-analysis.  ;"BACKGROUND: Limited data exists demonstrating the efficacy of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) compared to median sternotomy (MS) for multiple valvular disease (MVD). This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to compare operative and peri-operative outcomes of MIS vs MS in MVD. METHODS: PubMed, Ovid, and Embase were searched from inception until August 2019 for randomized and observational studies comparing MIS and MS in patients with MVD. Clinical outcomes of intra- and postoperative times, reoperation for bleeding and surgical site infection were evaluated. RESULTS: Five observational studies comparing 340 MIS vs 414 MS patients were eligible for qualitative and quantitative review. The quality of evidence assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale was good for all included studies. Meta-analysis demonstrated increased cardiopulmonary bypass time for MIS patients (weighted mean difference [WMD], 0.487; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.365-0.608; P < .0001). Similarly, aortic cross-clamp time was longer in patients undergoing MIS (WMD, 0.632; 95% CI, 0.509-0.755; P < .0001). No differences were found in operative mortality, reoperation for bleeding, surgical site infection, or hospital stay. CONCLUSIONS: MIS for MVD have similar short-term outcomes compared to MS. This adds value to the use of minimally invasive methods for multivalvular surgery, despite conferring longer operative times. However, the paucity in literature and learning curve associated with MIS warrants further evidence, ideally randomized control trials, to support these findings.  "
MDCT planning of trans catheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI): determination of optimal c-arm angulation.  ;"A fluoroscopic view perpendicular to the aortic valve annulus is required during transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) for obtaining an optimal deployment of the bioprosthesis. By predicting c-arm angulation, pre-procedural MDCT could decrease the number of aortograms, shorten the time of the procedure and reduce the amount of intra-arterial contrast agent. The aim of our study was to assess the accuracy of MDCT in predicting c-arm angulation at the cath. lab. In this single center study, we investigated MDCT prediction of c-arm angulation in patients having undergone a TAVI procedure using SAPIEN 3® (Edwards Lifesciences, USA). Prior to the procedure, an experienced radiologist had reported the angulation using dedicated software (CTreport). After the procedure, a blinded experienced radiologist retrospectively measured the angles using the same method (CTstudy). Interobserver variability was drawn from the comparison between CTreport and CTstudy. Then, the mean angular difference between the predicted MDCT angles (CTstudy) was compared to the working view recorded at the cath. lab. Seventy-nine patients (M/F = 0.65; mean age: 85.2 years ± 5.3) were included. Interobserver variability was 5.9 ± 6.1°. The mean absolute difference between MDCT and fluoroscopy was 8.8 ± 7.1°. The present study showed that MDCT could predict the coplanar fluoroscopic angles prior to TAVI using a balloon-expandable bioprosthesis Sapien 3® placed via a transfemoral approach with a mean angular difference of 8.8 ± 7.1°. Reproducibility was considered good as the mean difference between two independent measures was 5.9 ± 6.1°.  "
Grading of aortic regurgitation by cardiovascular magnetic resonance and pulsed Doppler of the left subclavian artery: harmonizing grading scales between imaging modalities.  ;"Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) are current standard for assessing aortic regurgitation (AR). Regurgitant fraction (RF) can also be estimated by Doppler examination of the left subclavian artery (LSA-Doppler). However, a comparison of AR grading scales using these methods and a TTE multiparametric approach as reference is lacking. We evaluated the severity of AR in 73 patients (58 ± 15 years; 57 men), with a wide spectrum of AR of the native valve. Using a recommended TTE multiparametric approach the AR was divided in none/trace (n = 12), mild (n = 23), moderate (n = 12), and severe (n = 26). RF was evaluated by LSA-Doppler (ratio between diastolic and systolic velocity-time integrals) and by CMR phase-contrast imaging (performed in the aorta 1 cm above the aortic valve); the grading scales were then calculated. There were a good correlation between all methods, but mean RF values were greater with TTE compared with LSA-Doppler and CMR (39 ± 16% vs. 35 ± 18% vs. 32 ± 20%, respectively; p < 0.037). Mean differences in RF values between methods were significant in the groups with mild and moderate AR. Grading scales that best defined the TTE derived AR severity using CMR were: mild, < 21%; moderate, 22 to 41%; and severe, > 42%; and using LSA-Doppler: mild, < 29%; moderate, 30 to 44%; and severe, > 45%. RF values for AR grading using TTE, LSA-Doppler and CMR correlate well but differ in groups with mild and moderate AR when using a recognized multiparametric echocardiographic approach. Clinical prospective studies should validate these proposed modality adjusted grading scales.  "
Risk Factors for the Development of Functional Tricuspid Regurgitation and Their Population-Attributable Fractions.  ;"OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to determine risk factors for progression to hemodynamically significant tricuspid regurgitation (TR) and the population burden attributable to these risk factors. BACKGROUND: Few data are available with regard to risk factors associated with the development of hemodynamically significant functional TR. METHODS: A total of 1,552 subjects were studied beginning with an index echocardiogram demonstrating trivial or mild TR. Risk factors for progression to moderate or severe TR were determined by using logistic regression and classification trees. Population attributable fractions were calculated for each risk factor. RESULTS: During a median follow-up time of 38 (interquartile range [IQR]: 26 to 63) months, 292 patients (18.8%) developed moderate/severe TR. Independent predictors of TR progression were age, female sex, heart failure, pacemaker electrode, atrial fibrillation (AF), and indicators of left heart disease, including left atrial (LA) enlargement, elevated pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), and left-sided valvular disease. Classification and regression tree analysis demonstrated that the strongest predictors of TR progression were PAP of ≥36 mm Hg, LA enlargement, age ≥60 years, and AF. In the absence of these 4 risk factors, progression to moderate or severe TR occurred in ∼3% of patients. Age (28.4%) and PAP (20.5%) carried the highest population-attributable fractions for TR progression. In patients with TR progression, there was a marked concomitant increase of incident cases of elevated PAP (40%); mitral and aortic valve intervention (12%); reductions in left ventricular ejection fraction (19%), and new AF (32%) (all p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: TR progression is determined mainly by markers of increased left-sided filling pressures (PAP and LA enlargement), AF, and age. At the population level, age and PAP are the most important contributors to the burden of significant TR. TR progression entails a marked parallel increase in the severity of left-sided heart disease.  "
Transcatheter Heart Valves: Not a Matter of Chance But of CHOICE.  ;"Comment on JACC Cardiovasc Interv. 2020 May 11;13(9):1071-1082.  "

Outcomes of the First 300 Cases of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation at a High-Volume Australian Private Hospital.  ;BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) was first performed in Australia in 2008 with a steady increase in the number of implanting centres from seven in 2008 to 42 in 2018 (24 private and 18 public hospitals). There is limited published data on outcomes from Australian centres and no published data from Australian private hospitals. We describe outcomes of the first 300 cases at Queensland's first TAVI implanting private hospital. METHODS: From July 2015 to August 2018, 300 patients with severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis underwent TAVI at our centre. A heart team assessed all patients as suitable. All patients underwent computed tomography (CT) assessment of valve sizing and peripheral access. RESULTS: Median age was 85 years, 58% male, mean Society of Thoracic Surgeons' score 4.0%, 49% had New York Heart Association Class III/IV, 28% previous coronary artery bypass grafts, 14% peripheral vascular disease and 3.7% renal impairment (creatinine >177 μmol/L). At 30 days mortality was 1%, stroke 1.3%, myocardial infarction (MI) 0.3%, major vascular complication 3.0%, no life-threatening or disabling bleeding and new permanent pacemaker (PPM) requirement was 9.0%. Paravalvular leak was none, trace and mild in 27%, 53% and 20% respectively with 0.3%≥moderate paravalvular leak. At 1 year, mortality was 4.2%, stroke 2.1%, MI 0.3%, no life-threatening bleeding and PPM 11.4%. Lower rates of mortality, stroke, and major vascular complications were observed compared to the well-established TAVI centres in USA and Germany. CONCLUSION: Excellent TAVI clinical outcomes can be achieved in the Australian private hospital setting. Expert heart team assessment and CT guided procedural planning are key to these outcomes.  
Unplanned Thirty-Day Readmission After Alcohol Septal Ablation for Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (From the Nationwide Readmission Database).  ;Alcohol septal ablation (ASA) is indicated for symptomatic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HC) patients. We sought to analyze the incidence of the 30-day readmission rate, predictors, causes of readmission, and incremental healthcare resource (cost and length of stay) utilization after ASA. Nationwide Readmission Database from 2010 January to 2015 September was queried to identify 30-day unplanned readmission after ASA for HC by using the International Classification of Disease, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification. Those readmitted were similar in terms of age and sex but had higher burden of co-morbidities compared with those not readmitted within 30-days. The 30-day unplanned readmission rate was 10.4% (511/4,932) after ASA. Readmissions lead to an additional mean hospitalization cost of 8,433 US dollars and mean of 4.9 days of length of stay. Predictors of 30-day unplanned readmission were liver disease (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.62, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.22 to 5.59), renal failure (aOR 2.30, 95%CI 1.52 to 3.50), previous myocardial infarction (aOR 1.97, 95%CI 1.16 to 3.33), previous pacemaker (aOR 1.50, 95%CI 1.09 to 2.08), atrial fibrillation (aOR 1.43, 95%CI 1.08 to 1.89), Medicaid (aOR 1.74, 95%CI 1.12 to 2.68), and weekend admission (aOR 1.75, 95%CI 1.12 to 2.75). Common reasons for readmissions were atrial fibrillation (12.6%), acute on chronic systolic heart failure (12.6%), paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia (6.4%), atrioventricular block (4.9%), and HC (3.0%). Unplanned readmissions after ASA occur in patients with higher burden of co-morbidities and are mainly caused by cardiac etiologies.  
Single Coil Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator Leads in Patients With Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy.  ;"Patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HC) may require higher energies to terminate ventricular fibrillation (VF); thus, dual coil defibrillation leads are often implanted. However, single coil leads may be preferred in young patients. All patients with HCM implanted with a transvenous ICD from years 2000 to 2014 were included. Of 249 patients, 223 underwent VF testing including 150 with a dual coil lead and 73 a single coil. Patients tested with dual coil compared with single coil had lower successful VF energies (15.7 ± 6.1 joule to 20.2 ± 7.9 joule (p <0.0001)). Adequate safety margin for defibrillation was noted in 97.3% of patients. Notably, 6 (4 with single coil leads) had inadequate safety margins (defined as ≥10 joule). Three of these 6 patients required replacement of a single coil lead with a dual coil lead. The remaining 3 underwent waveform tilt alteration, higher energy ICD, or removal of the can from the shock vector. There were no clinical or implant predictors of inadequate safety margins. In follow-up of 16 ± 30 months (range 0 to 170), there were 24 arrhythmias including 13 VF, all successfully terminated. In conclusion, in HC patients undergoing ICD implantation, single coil leads can provide adequate safety margins. In conclusion, defibrillation testing should be considered in all HC patients undergoing ICD implantation, and should be performed in those undergoing implantation with a single coil lead.  "

The impact of the aortic cusps fusion pattern and valve disease severity on the aortic wall mechanics in patients with bicuspid aortic valve.  ;The ascending aorta dilatation in the bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) patients is often attributed to congenital abnormalities of the aortic wall, but it may be related to hemodynamic disturbances in the course of BAV disease. At present, ascending aortic diameter is used as almost sole but weak predictor of aortic dissection and rupture in BAV. We examined the association between aortic wall mechanics and severity of aortic valve disease including different cusps fusion patterns using conventional echocardiography and tissue Doppler imaging (TDI). We prospectively studied 106 BAV patients: 72 with right-left (R-L) coronary cusp fusion were matched 1:1 to 34 patients with right-noncoronary (R-N) cusp fusion obtaining 34 pairs of patients. Peak systolic radial velocity and acceleration of the ascending aortic wall, measured by TDI, were used as an index of hemodynamic stress imposed on the aorta. Paired analysis showed higher aortic wall radial velocity (4.71 ± 1.61 cm/s vs. 3.33 ± 1.44 cm/s, p = 0.001) and acceleration (1.08 ± 0.46 m/s2 vs. 0.80 ± 0.34 m/s2, p = 0.015) in-R-L compared to R-N fusion. Pearson correlation showed association of ascending tubular aortic diameter with age (r = 0.258, p = 0.012), weight (r = 0.323, p = 0.001), peak aortic valve gradient (r = 0.386, p = 0.0001), aortic root diameter (r = 0.439, p < 0.0001), and R-N fusion pattern (r = 0.209, p = 0.043). Aortic root diameter was related to male gender (r = 0.296, p = 0.003), weight (r = 0.381, p = 0.0001), ascending aortic diameter (r = 0.439, p < 0.0001), and severity of aortic regurgitation (r = 0.337, p = 0.0009). Regional differences in aortic wall motion between different BAV cusp fusion patterns and association of aortic diameters with the severity of aortic valve disease, both suggest a deleterious hemodynamic impact of cusp fusion patterns and aortic valve dysfunction on ascending aortic wall. Assessment of aortic hemodynamic by TDI is feasible and could be potentially used to improve prediction of acute aortic complications, thus helping to establish optimal timing of aortic surgery in BAV patients.  
Cerebrovascular events after transcatheter mitral valve interventions: a systematic review and meta-analysis.  ;"OBJECTIVE: Current guidelines support the use of transcatheter mitral valve interventions to treat some selected high-risk patients with significant mitral valvulopathy. As with any other interventional cardiac procedure, concerns have been raised about cerebrovascular event. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to determine the incidence of cerebrovascular events following (1) transcatheter mitral valve edge-to-edge repair with mitral valve clip and (2) transcatheter mitral valve replacement (TMVR). METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of studies reporting the cerebrovascular adverse events after transcatheter mitral valve edge-to-edge repair and TMVR procedures. The primary endpoint was the incidence of cerebrovascular events as defined by the Mitral Valve Academic Research Consortium. An event that occurred within 30 days or during index hospitalisation was defined as periprocedural; otherwise it was defined as non-periprocedural. This study was designed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Aggregated study-level data were pooled using a random effect model. The quality of each study was appraised with the Hawker checklist, a method of systematically reviewing research from different paradigms. RESULTS: Sixty studies totalling 28 155 patients undergoing edge-to-edge repair with mitral valve clip were included in the analysis. Periprocedural stroke and non-periprocedural stroke rates were 0.9% (95% CI 0.6 to 1.1) and 2.4% (95% CI 1.6 to 3.2), respectively. For TMVR procedures, 26 studies including 1910 patients were analysed. The estimated periprocedural stroke incidence was 1% (95% CI 0.5 to 1.8) compared with 7% (95% CI 0.8 to 18.5) for non-periprocedural stroke. CONCLUSIONS: Transcatheter mitral valve interventions are associated with low rates of cerebrovascular events. The exact mechanisms of these complications are still poorly understood given the relative paucity of good quality data. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42019117257.  "
Temporal Trends in Prevalence of Tricuspid Valve Disease in Hospitalized Patients in the United States.  ;Tricuspid valve disease (TVD), particularly tricuspid regurgitation, is a common valvular pathology that is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The prevalence of TVD in hospitalized patients has not been well characterized. We used the National Inpatient Sample to determine the overall and age- and sex-specific prevalence and temporal trends in prevalence of TVD in hospitalized patients in the US. All-cause and heart failure (HF) hospitalizations in patients ≥50 years of age from January 2006 to September 2015 in the US were identified. Temporal trends in the prevalence of TVD were studied using Poisson regression. Of 194,184,433 all-cause and 38,083,773 HF hospitalizations in patients ≥50 years of age, 3,235,292 (1.7%) and 1,787,548 (4.7%) had a diagnosis of TVD, respectively. From 2006 to 2015, the prevalence of TVD in all hospitalizations and in HF hospitalizations increased from 1.7% to 2.0% and from 3.9% to 5.7%, respectively (ptrend <0.001 for both), particularly in those ≥85 years of age and in women. In patients with TVD, primary reasons for hospitalizations were HF (20.8%), infections (10.1%), arrhythmias (9.8%), respiratory conditions (8.4%), and coronary artery disease/acute myocardial infarction (8.2%). In-hospital mortality and length of stay in patients with TVD remained unchanged, whereas costs of hospitalization increased during the study period. In conclusion, the prevalence of TVD in all hospitalized patients and in those hospitalized with HF has increased over the past several years, particularly in those ≥85 years of age and in women. Approximately 1 in 5 hospitalizations with a diagnosis of TVD is due to HF.  
Congenital right coronary artery aneurysm with fistula to right ventricle associated with isolated pulmonary valvular stenosis.  ;Congenital aneurysmal dilatation of coronary artery with coronary cameral fistula is rare in childhood.

Late Outcomes of Valve Repair Versus Replacement in Isolated and Concomitant Tricuspid Valve Surgery: A Nationwide Cohort Study.  ;"Background Surgery for tricuspid valve (TV) diseases is associated with poor prognosis, but few studies have described the long-term outcomes by comparing TV repair and replacement in isolated and concomitant TV surgeries separately. Methods and Results Between 2000 and 2013, adult patients who underwent TV repair or replacement surgeries were identified from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. Outcomes of interest included all-cause mortality, composite outcome, and readmission attributable to any cause. Inverse probability of treatment weighting was used to reduce confounding effects. A total of 2644 patients with a mean follow-up of 4.9 years were included. Of them, 12.6% and 87.4% underwent isolated and concomitant TV surgery, respectively. The in-hospital mortality rates for isolated and concomitant TV surgery were 8.7% and 8.6%, respectively, whereas all-cause mortality rates were 41.7% and 36.8%, respectively. Compared with TV replacement, TV repair demonstrated significantly lower risks of all-cause mortality (concomitant: hazard ratio [HR], 0.76; 95% CI, 0.59-0.99), composite outcome (isolated: subdistribution HR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.35-0.89; concomitant: subdistribution HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.46-0.86), and readmission (isolated: subdistribution HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.46-0.91; concomitant: subdistribution HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.60-0.86), except insignificant difference in all-cause mortality in isolated surgery. Conclusions Compared with replacement, TV repair is associated with better short- and long-term outcomes in both isolated and concomitant TV surgery. However, further prospective clinical trials are warranted.  "
Functional tricuspid regurgitation of degenerative mitral valve disease: a crucial determinant of survival.  ;AIMS : To assess functional tricuspid regurgitation (FTR) determinants, consequences, and independent impact on outcome in degenerative mitral regurgitation (DMR). METHODS AND RESULTS : All patients diagnosed with isolated DMR 2003-2011, with structurally normal tricuspid leaflets, prospective FTR grading and systolic pulmonary artery pressure (sPAP) estimation by Doppler echocardiography at diagnosis were identified and long-term outcome analysed. The 5083 DMR eligible patients [63 ± 16 years, 47% female, ejection fraction (EF) 63 ± 7%, and sPAP 35 ± 13 mmHg] presented with FTR graded trivial in 45%, mild in 37%, moderate in 15%, and severe in 3%. While pulmonary hypertension (PHTN-sPAP ≥ 50 mmHg) was the most powerful FTR severity determinant, other strong FTR determinants were older age, female sex, lower left ventricle EF, DMR, and particularly atrial fibrillation (AFib) (all P ≤ 0.002). Functional tricuspid regurgitation moderate/severe was independently linked to more severe clinical presentation, more oedema, lower stroke volume, and impaired renal function (P ≤ 0.01). Survival (95% confidence interval) throughout follow-up [70% (69-72%) at 10 years] was strongly associated with FTR severity [82% (80-84%) for trivial, 69% (66-71%) for mild, 51% (47-57%) for moderate, and 26% (19-35%) for severe, P < 0.0001]. Excess mortality persisted after comprehensive adjustment [adjusted hazard ratio 1.40 (1.18-1.67) for moderate FTR and 2.10 (1.63-2.70) for severe FTR, P ≤ 0.01]. Excess mortality persisted adjusting for sPAP/right ventricular function (P < 0.0001), by matching [adjusted hazard ratios 2.08 (1.50-2.89), P < 0.0001] and vs. expected survival [risk ratio 1.79 (1.48-2.16), P < 0.0001]. Within 5-year of diagnosis valve surgery was performed in 73% (70-75%) and 15% (13-17%) of severe and moderate DMR and in only 26% (19-34%) and 6% (4-8%) of severe and moderate FTR. Valvular surgery improved outcome without alleviating completely higher mortality associated with FTR (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION : In this large DMR cohort, FTR was frequent and causally, not only linked to PHTN but also to other factors, particularly AFib. Higher FTR severity is associated at diagnosis with more severe clinical presentation. Long term, FTR is independently of all confounders, associated with considerably worse mortality. Functional tricuspid regurgitation moderate and even severe is profoundly undertreated. Thus careful assessment, consideration for tricuspid surgery, and testing of new transcatheter therapy is warranted.  
Genetic predisposition to smoking in relation to 14 cardiovascular diseases.  ;Comment in doi: 10.1093/eurheartj/ehaa285.  
A novel variant in MAP3K7 associated with an expanded cardiospondylocarpofacial syndrome phenotype.  ;The transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) encoded by mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 7 (MAP3K7) is widely expressed and participates in multiple molecular and cellular processes, including growth, differentiation, inflammation, and apoptosis. Pathogenic variants in MAP3K7 have recently been associated with two disorders: cardiospondylocarpofacial syndrome (CSCFS) and frontometaphyseal dysplasia 2 (FMD2). To date, all small in-frame deletions and splice variants in MAP3K7 have been associated with CSCFS, whereas missense variants have been reported in both CSCFS and FMD2. Here, we present a patient with a novel heterozygous likely pathogenic variant, c.125_127del, p.(Val42del), in MAP3K7, only the sixth variant associated with CSCFS to be described in the literature. Although this patient has a phenotype that is most consistent with that of CSCFS, including valvular heart disease, short stature, fusions of the spine and bones of the hands and feet, and certain facial dysmorphisms, he interestingly has some features reported previously in FMD2 but not CSCFS. These include flexion contractures of the elbow and widely spaced first and second toes, highlighting new points of overlap between these two syndromes. We additionally point out features in the patient presented here that are rare but recurrent among CSCFS patients previously reported in the literature, as well as a new distinctive cutaneous finding not previously reported.  
Echocardiographic parameters determining cardiovascular outcomes in patients after acute ischemic stroke.  ;"Previous studies have focused on only 1 or 2 echocardiographic parameters as prognostic markers in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS). A total of 900 patients with AIS who underwent transthoracic echocardiography (72.6 ± 12.0 years and 60% males) were retrospectively reviewed. Composite clinical events, including all-cause mortality, non-fatal stroke, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and coronary revascularization, were assessed during clinical follow-ups. During a median follow-up of 3.3 years (interquartile range 0.6-5.1 years), there were 151 (16.8%) composite events. In the multivariable analyses after controlling for potential confounders, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 62% (hazard ratio [HR] 1.62; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.14-2.30; p = 0.007) and AV sclerosis (AVs) (HR 1.56; 95% CI 1.10-2.21; p = 0.013) were independent prognostic factors associated with composite events. Multivariable analyses showed that HR for composite events gradually increased according to LVEF and AVs: HR was 2.6-fold higher in the highest-risk group than in the lowest group (p < 0.001). Compared with a clinical model (global chi-square = 69.6), LVEF, AVs, and both of them were significantly improved outcome prediction in sequential Cox model analysis (global chi-square = 75.6, 75.7, and 78.8, respectively; p < 0.05 for each) for each. In patients with AIS, LVEF < 62%, and the presence of AV sclerosis can predict future vascular events. Patients with AIS exhibiting reduced LVEF and AV sclerosis may benefit from aggressive secondary prevention.  "
Tissue Doppler velocities for ruling out rejection in heart transplant recipients in the context of myocardial strain imaging: a multivariate, prospective, single-center study.  ;To investigate the value of tissue Doppler velocities for ruling out treatment-requiring acute cellular rejection (TR-ACR), in the context of myocardial deformation analysis performed by means of speckle tracking echocardiography. We performed serial echocardiograms in 37 heart transplant recipients in their first year post-transplantation within 3 h of the routine surveillance endomyocardial biopsies (EMB). The association of the sum of lateral mitral annulus systolic (s') and early diastolic (e') velocities, in absolute values, measured by tissue Doppler echocardiography (s'+ e'), with TR-ACR (ACR grade ≥ 2R) was investigated by multivariate analysis, including classic echocardiographic parameters and myocardial deformation variables. A total of 251 pairs of EMB and echo exams were performed, 35 (14%) with rejection grade ≥ 2R (TR-ACR). s' + e' was independently associated to TR-ACR (OR 0.80, 95%CI 0.72-0.89, p < 0.0005), with a C statistic of 0.79 (95%CI 0.71-0.87, p < 0.0005) by ROC curve analysis. An  s'+ e' value ≥ 23 cm/s, present in 43% of studies, had a negative predictive value of 98% for ruling out TR-ACR. Moreover, in the same patients, s'+ e' significantly decreased when TR-ACR occurred after a study without this condition (- 3.7 ± 3.3 cm/s, p = 0.003), but it was similar when rejection status was the same in the present versus the previous study. A drop in s'+ e' value < 2.7 cm/s from the previous echocardiogram, had a 99% negative predictive value for ruling out TR-ACR. Tissue Doppler velocities, a widely available echo parameter, were found to be a valuable marker for ruling out TR-ACR in this multivariate study which included myocardial deformation variables.

Ventriculoatrial malalignment in atrioventricular septal defect resulting in uniatrial biventricular connection: surgical options.  ;BACKGROUND: Uniatrial biventricular connection (UBC) is a rare cardiovascular anomaly characterized by absence of one atrioventricular connection and drainage of the other atrium via a solitary atrioventricular valve into both ventricles. The absent atrioventricular connection may affect either the left or right atrium. Because of the absence of one atrioventricular connection hearts with UBC have been classified among functionally univentricular hearts requiring palliative treatment according to the Fontan principle. AIMS/OBJECTIVE: We report two further patients with UBC. In one of these patients careful echocardiographic examination of the atrioventricular junction in early infancy revealed the possibility of biventricular repair based on the favorable anatomy of the atrioventricular valve and balanced ventricles in the presence of an inlet ventricular septal defect (VSD). CASE PRESENTATIONS: Both patients presented in the neonatal period for evaluation of complex congenital heart disease. The anatomy of the atrioventricular valves in our patients was indistinguishable from atrioventricular septal defects exhibiting the morphology of a common valve with superior and inferior bridging leaflets. The common atrioventricular valve was connected exclusively to the right atrium draining into both ventricles while the left atrium drained into the right atrium via a secundum atrial septal defect. In one of our patients biventricular repair with good longterm-result was performed by reseptation of the atria, patch repair of the VSD and septation of the atrioventricular valve. The second patient underwent univentricular palliation according to the Fontan principle. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: The echocardiographic findings in our patients suggest that at least some patients with UBC represent a variant of atrioventricular septal defects associated with extreme ventriculoatrial malalignment resulting in fusion of the deviated primary atrial septum with the lateral aspect of the atrioventricular junction. This offers the option of septation of the common atrioventricular valve and biventricular repair in patients with adequate size of both ventricles. Exact echocardiographic analysis of the morphology of the atrioventricular valve is essential to distinguish these patients with a morphologically common atrioventricular valve in early infancy from other variants of absent atrioventricular connection and to select those who are suitable for biventricular repair.  
Macrophages Promote Aortic Valve Cell Calcification and Alter STAT3 Splicing.  ;OBJECTIVE: Macrophages have been described in calcific aortic valve disease, but it is unclear if they promote or counteract calcification. We aimed to determine how macrophages are involved in calcification using the Notch1+/- model of calcific aortic valve disease. Approach and Results: Macrophages in wild-type and Notch1+/- murine aortic valves were characterized by flow cytometry. Macrophages in Notch1+/- aortic valves had increased expression of MHCII (major histocompatibility complex II). We then used bone marrow transplants to test if differences in Notch1+/- macrophages drive disease. Notch1+/- mice had increased valve thickness, macrophage infiltration, and proinflammatory macrophage maturation regardless of transplanted bone marrow genotype. In vitro approaches confirm that Notch1+/- aortic valve cells promote macrophage invasion as quantified by migration index and proinflammatory phenotypes as quantified by Ly6C and CCR2 positivity independent of macrophage genotype. Finally, we found that macrophage interaction with aortic valve cells promotes osteogenic, but not dystrophic, calcification and decreases abundance of the STAT3β isoform. CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals that Notch1+/- aortic valve disease involves increased macrophage recruitment and maturation driven by altered aortic valve cell secretion, and that increased macrophage recruitment promotes osteogenic calcification and alters STAT3 splicing. Further investigation of STAT3 and macrophage-driven inflammation as therapeutic targets in calcific aortic valve disease is warranted.  
[Association between single nucleotide polymorphism in promoter region of SIRT1 gene and senile degenerative heart valvular disease].  ;Objective: To investigate the correlation between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of SIRT1 gene promoter sequence and senile degenerative heart valvular disease (SDHVD). Methods: A total of 236 SDHVD patients and 285 healthy controls who visited the Affiliated Hospital of Jining Medical University between February 2012 and October 2016 were enrolled. SNPs of SIRT1 gene promoter were detected by Sanger sequencing. Typing and correlation were analyzed by χ(2) test and Logistic regression analysis. Haplotype and linkage disequilibrium were analyzed by Haploview4.2 software and SHEsis online software. The effect of SNPs on the binding of transcription factors to SIRT1 gene promoter was analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay(EMSA). The transcription factors affected by SNPs were predicted by Transfac online software. Results: The frequency distribution of GG genotype of rs3740051 in the SDHVD group was significantly higher than that in the control group (χ(2)=4.855, P=0.028). There was a correlation between GG genotype of the rs3740051 and SDHVD. After adjusting for age, the risk of SDHVD in the carrier of GG genotype was 3.079 times higher than that of AA genotype(OR=3.079, 95%CI: 1.156-8.201, P=0.024). The five SNPs (rs3740051, rs932658, rs35995735, rs3740053 and rs2394443) showed strong linkage disequilibrium(D'>0.8). The haplotype analysis of the five SNPs (haplotype frequency<0 was ignored in the analysis) showed that 11 haplotypes (P<0.05) were formed, and the frequency of *A**C, AA**C, *AG*C, AAG*C, AA*AC, *AGAC and AAGAC in SDHVD group were significantly higher than that in control group (P<0.05, OR>1, 95%CI does not contains 1). EMSA showed that the color of the binding bands incubated by wild type probe and nucleoprotein was darker than that incubated by DNA sequence variation probe and nucleoprotein. Conclusion: The GG genotype of rs3740051 is associated with SDHVD and may be a risk genotype for SDHVD. The haplotype AC (across rs932658 and rs2394443) may be a dangerous haplotype of SDHVD. rs3740051 may affect the occurrence and development of SDHVD by interfering with the binding of FOXC protein to SIRT1 gene promoter.

A Misdiagnosed Case of Double Outlet Right Atrium Associated With Hypoplastic Right Ventricle.  ;Double outlet right atrium (DORA) is a rare congenital heart disease in which the right atrium opens into both ventricles. The reduced leftward motion of the interventricular septum causes a malalignment between the atrial and the ventricular septum at the cardiac crux, which is the pathognomonic feature of this heart defect. We describe a case of significant exertional desaturation in an adult patient who was diagnosed with DORA, restrictive right ventricle, and anomalous tricuspid valve. Subsequently, the patient underwent one-and-a-half ventricular palliation.

Utility of CT Angiography for the Prediction of Coronary Artery Compression in Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Pulmonary Valve Replacement.  ;OBJECTIVES: We aimed to evaluate the utility of computed tomography angiography (CTA) for coronary compression (CC) prediction in patients with congenital heart disease undergoing balloon-expandable transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement (TPVR). BACKGROUND: Coronary compression is a serious complication of TPVR, but the value of preprocedural CTAs to assess CC risk is largely unexplored. METHODS: In all, 586 patients underwent TPVR between January 2009 and July 2018. Adults with a pre-TPVR CTA and children with a CTA performed less than one year prior to TPVR were included. Patients with poor CTA image quality or with aborted cases due to reasons other than CC were excluded. Sixty-six patients were finally included. Cardiac anatomy was assessed via multiplanar reconstruction of CTAs. RESULTS: Coronary compression occurred in 9 (14%) of the 66 patients who underwent TPVR. Most CC cases (seven of nine) occurred in patients with conduits. Proximity of the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) landing zone to the coronary arteries and to the chest wall was a significant risk factor for compression (P < .001 and P = .019, respectively). Compression risk increased significantly if patients had an RVOT to coronary artery distance of ≤3 mm (P < .001) and an RVOT to chest wall distance of ≤8 mm (P = .026). Anomalous course of coronary arteries was another significant univariate risk factor (P = .003). CONCLUSIONS: Right ventricular outflow tract landing zone distance of ≤3 mm to a coronary artery, landing zone distance of ≤8 mm to the chest wall, and anomalous coronary arteries are associated with increased CC risk. Electrocardiogram gating may not be necessary if coronary arteries are opacified on CTAs. Larger studies are needed to explore and confirm these coronary artery compression risk factors.  
Identification and analysis of KLF13 variants in patients with congenital heart disease.  ;"BACKGROUND: The protein Kruppel-like factor 13 (KLF13) is a member of the KLF family and has been identified as a cardiac transcription factor that is involved in heart development. However, the relationship between KLF13 variants and CHDs in humans remains largely unknown. The present study aimed to screen the KLF13 variants in CHD patients and genetically analyze the functions of these variants. METHODS: KLF13 variants were sequenced in a cohort of 309 CHD patients and population-matched healthy controls (n = 200) using targeted sequencing. To investigate the effect of variants on the functional properties of the KLF13 protein, the expression and subcellular localization of the protein, as well as the transcriptional activities of downstream genes and physical interactions with other transcription factors, were assessed. RESULTS: Two heterozygous variants, c.487C > T (P163S) and c.467G > A (S156N), were identified in two out of 309 CHD patients with tricuspid valve atresia and transposition of the great arteries, respectively. No variants were found among healthy controls. The variant c.467G > A (S156N) had increased protein expression and enhanced functionality compared with the wild type, without affecting the subcellular localization. The other variant, c.487C > T (P163S), did not show any abnormalities in protein expression or subcellular localization; however, it inhibited the transcriptional activities of downstream target genes and physically interacted with TBX5, another cardiac transcription factor. CONCLUSION: Our results show that the S156N and P163S variants may affect the transcriptional function of KLF13 and physical interaction with TBX5. These results identified KLF13 as a potential genetic risk factor for congenital heart disease.  "
Catheter ablation is preferred over surgery for persistent atrial fibrillation.  ;There are important limitations that can hinder outcomes of surgical ablation in nonparoxysmal patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), which is the typical AF population undergoing concomitant cardiac surgery for valve or ischemic heart disease. Incomplete lesions with recovered conduction or gaps as well as arrhythmias originating from areas not targeted by surgical ablation are commonly seen at the time of recurrence. Therefore, while it might be reasonable to perform AF surgery in this cohort, it is important to know these limitations and establish adequate postoperative rhythm monitoring to detect recurrences, which can be effectively addressed by catheter ablation.  
"Caseous calcification of the mitral annulus; scary image during robotic surgery.  ";"Caseous calcification of the mitral annulus (CCMA) is a very rare form of mitral annular calcification (MAC). CCMA accounts for 0.63% of all cases and 0.06-0.07% of the total population and usually seen in elderly and female patients. It mostly affects the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve. The pathogenesis of CCMA remains unclear. Hypercholesterolemia and the dissolution of lipid-laden macrophages may be implicated in liquefaction necrosis. CCMA is composed of a mixture of calcium, fatty acid, and cholesterol. The name ""caseous"" comes from the cheese-like or toothpaste-like consistency of the mass. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging may help in differentiating MAC from CCMA and should perform. The first treatment option should be conservative treatment because of surgical complications of the procedure. We presented a case report which is about CCMA with preoperative and intraoperative robotic images.  "
Quantitative Proteomics of Human Heart Samples Collected In Vivo Reveal the Remodeled Protein Landscape of Dilated Left Atrium Without Atrial Fibrillation.  ;Genetic and genomic research has greatly advanced our understanding of heart disease. Yet, comprehensive, in-depth, quantitative maps of protein expression in hearts of living humans are still lacking. Using samples obtained during valve replacement surgery in patients with mitral valve prolapse (MVP), we set out to define inter-chamber differences, the intersect of proteomic data with genetic or genomic datasets, and the impact of left atrial dilation on the proteome of patients with no history of atrial fibrillation (AF).We collected biopsies from right atria (RA), left atria (LA) and left ventricle (LV) of seven male patients with mitral valve regurgitation with dilated LA but no history of AF. Biopsy samples were analyzed by high-resolution mass spectrometry (MS), where peptides were pre-fractionated by reverse phase high-pressure liquid chromatography prior to MS measurement on a Q-Exactive-HF Orbitrap instrument. We identified 7,314 proteins based on 130,728 peptides. Results were confirmed in an independent set of biopsies collected from three additional individuals. Comparative analysis against data from post-mortem samples showed enhanced quantitative power and confidence level in samples collected from living hearts. Our analysis, combined with data from genome wide association studies suggested candidate gene associations to MVP, identified higher abundance in ventricle for proteins associated with cardiomyopathies and revealed the dilated LA proteome, demonstrating differential representation of molecules previously associated with AF, in non-AF hearts.This is the largest dataset of cardiac protein expression from human samples collected in vivo It provides a comprehensive resource that allows insight into molecular fingerprints of MVP and facilitates novel inferences between genomic data and disease mechanisms. We propose that over-representation of proteins in ventricle is consequent not to redundancy but to functional need, and conclude that changes in abundance of proteins known to associate with AF are not sufficient for arrhythmogenesis.

Sports Participation and Exercise Restriction in Children with Isolated Bicuspid Aortic Valve.  ;"Our study was to apply the 2015 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology Athletic Participation Guidelines to a group of otherwise healthy school age children and young adults with bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) and describe the potential competitive sports restriction as they age. We performed a retrospective chart review of children and young adults aged 5 to 22 years with isolated BAV with at least two echocardiograms between 2000 and 2013. Using task force guidelines, exercise restriction was recommended for any of the following: (1) any dilation of the aortic root, (2) any dilation of the ascending aorta, (3) moderate aortic stenosis, (4) severe aortic regurgitation; (5) left ventricular dilation or (6) reduced shortening fraction. Of the 345 patients with isolated BAV, 202 were considered restricted at study entry. The final cohort included 123 children and young adults. Over the course of follow up, 36% (44 of 123) met restriction criteria. The most likely cause for restriction was aortic dilation (34%). Progression of aortic valve disease occurred in a minority of patients (3%). There were no reports of death, dissection or catheter or surgical based intervention. In conclusion, we found that strict adherence to current guidelines would result in restriction of more than 1/3 of school age children and young adults with BAV from some form of competitive athletics during school age years. Strict application of the current guidelines in this age group may lead to over-restriction of youths from competitive sports.  "
The ADAMTS/Fibrillin Connection: Insights into the Biological Functions of ADAMTS10 and ADAMTS17 and Their Respective Sister Proteases.  ;"Secreted a disintegrin-like and metalloprotease with thrombospondin type 1 motif (ADAMTS) proteases play crucial roles in tissue development and homeostasis. The biological and pathological functions of ADAMTS proteases are determined broadly by their respective substrates and their interactions with proteins in the pericellular and extracellular matrix. For some ADAMTS proteases, substrates have been identified and substrate cleavage has been implicated in tissue development and in disease. For other ADAMTS proteases, substrates were discovered in vitro, but the role of these proteases and the consequences of substrate cleavage in vivo remains to be established. Mutations in ADAMTS10 and ADAMTS17 cause Weill-Marchesani syndrome (WMS), a congenital syndromic disorder that affects the musculoskeletal system (short stature, pseudomuscular build, tight skin), the eyes (lens dislocation), and the heart (heart valve abnormalities). WMS can also be caused by mutations in fibrillin-1 (FBN1), which suggests that ADAMTS10 and ADAMTS17 cooperate with fibrillin-1 in a common biological pathway during tissue development and homeostasis. Here, we compare and contrast the biochemical properties of ADAMTS10 and ADAMTS17 and we summarize recent findings indicating potential biological functions in connection with fibrillin microfibrils. We also compare ADAMTS10 and ADAMTS17 with their respective sister proteases, ADAMTS6 and ADAMTS19; both were recently linked to human disorders distinct from WMS. Finally, we propose a model for the interactions and roles of these four ADAMTS proteases in the extracellular matrix.  "
The epidemiology of infective endocarditis with focus on non-device related right-sided infective endocarditis: A retrospective register-based study in the region of Southern Denmark.  ;AIMS: Non-device related right-sided infective endocarditis (ND-RSIE) is not well characterized. We aimed to characterize patients with infective endocarditis (IE) with emphasis on the epidemiology, clinical characteristics and complications of ND-RSIE. METHODS: In this population-based cohort study, we identified patients with IE using ICD-10 codes from the Danish National Hospital Register in the Region of Southern Denmark between January 2007 and May 2017. Hospital records were reviewed, and characteristics and outcomes recorded. RESULTS: We included 1243 confirmed IE episodes of which 82% were left-sided IE, 11% were cardiac device right sided infective endocarditis (RSIE) and 7% were ND-RSIE. Patients with ND-RSIE were considerably younger, had less comorbidity and had a lower 30-day mortality (6%) compared with patients with device RSIE (24%) and left-sided IE (26%) (p<0.01). ND-RSIE was associated with underlying heart disease, involvement of the tricuspid valve (57%), Staphylococcus species (53%) and complications (61%). Forty percent of ND-RSIE occurred among people who inject drugs (PWID) for whom significant differences were observed compared with non-PWID with regards to tricuspid valve involvement (96% vs. 32%), causative microorganisms (Staphylococcus aureus 79% vs. 27%), complications (86% vs. 45%), recurrence (29% vs. 11%) and 30-day mortality (0% vs. 7%). CONCLUSION: ND-RSIE is relatively rare and differs with regards to epidemiology, clinical characteristics and complications compared with left-sided IE and cardiac device RSIE, but has a favourable prognosis. Forty percent of ND-RSIE occurs among PWID, which is associated with frequent complications but a very low mortality.  
Impact of disproportionate secondary mitral regurgitation in patients undergoing edge-to-edge percutaneous mitral valve repair.  ;"AIMS: The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic role of echocardiographic parameters assessing secondary mitral regurgitation (SMR) severity and left ventricular dimension, including proportionate versus disproportionate SMR, in MitraClip recipients. METHODS AND RESULTS: We analysed 137 patients undergoing MitraClip implantation for SMR at three centres. SMR was classified as proportionate or disproportionate based on the median value of the ratio between effective regurgitant orifice area (EROA) and left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV). The primary endpoint was a composite of cardiovascular mortality and heart failure hospitalisation at two-year follow-up. Mean age was 70±10 years, 80% were male, and median EuroSCORE II was 5.7%. No differences were observed in the disproportionate compared to the proportionate group except for a more severe NYHA class and their expected higher EROA and lower LVEDV. Number of clips deployed, device success and procedural success were similar between the two groups. Residual mitral regurgitation (MR) >1+ at 30 days was more common among patients with an EROA >0.42 cm2 compared to those with an EROA ≤0.42 cm2 (81.3% vs 58%; p=0.004). The relative risk of the primary endpoint was independent from any echocardiographic parameter, including the presence of disproportionate SMR. The only independent predictors of clinical events were EuroSCORE II >8%, NYHA class and residual MR >1+ at 30 days. CONCLUSIONS: Echocardiographic parameters, including the EROA/LVEDV ratio, do not have independent prognostic value in patients undergoing MitraClip implantation. High surgical risk, advanced symptoms and non-optimal MR reduction increase the relative risk of two-year clinical events. Visual summary. Distribution of effective regurgitant orifice area (EROA) and left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) in our population and in those of the COAPT and MITRA-FR trials according to the proportionate/disproportionate classification of secondary mitral regurgitant (SMR) proposed by Grayburn et al (A). Kaplan-Meier curves for the primary endpoint (cardiovascular death or HF hospitalisation at 2 years post MitraClip) of the population stratified by the presence of proportionate SMR (EROA/LVEDV ratio below the median value) or disproportionate SMR (EROA/LVEDV ratio above the median value) (B). Residual SMR (30 days post MitraClip) in patients with baseline EROA above or below the median value (C). Multivariable analysis for the primary endpoint (D).  "
Screening for transcatheter mitral valve replacement: a decision tree algorithm.  ;AIMS: The high frequency of screening failure for anatomical reasons in patients with severe mitral valve regurgitation (MR) is a limiting factor in the screening process for transcatheter mitral valve replacement (TMVR). However, data on optimal patient selection are scarce. The present study aimed to develop a screening algorithm based on TMVR screening data. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 195 screenings for six different TMVR devices were performed in 94 high-risk patients with severe MR. We compared baseline echocardiographic and multislice computed tomography (MSCT) parameters between the subgroups of patients accepted (N=33) and rejected for TMVR (N=61). Reasons for screening failure were assessed, and a decision tree algorithm was statistically derived. Reasons for screening failure were small LV dimensions (30.6%), small (7.5%) or large (22.5%) annular size, potential risk of LVOT obstruction (22.0%) or mitral annulus calcification (15.6%). A four-step decision tree algorithm to assess TMVR eligibility was developed resulting in an AUC of 0.80 (95% CI: 0.71, 0.89, p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: This study presents the first screening algorithm to assess anatomical eligibility for TMVR in patients with severe MR, based on simple MSCT criteria. Given the high rate of TMVR screening failure, this algorithm may facilitate the identification of potential TMVR candidates.  
Non-coding RNAs as Epigenetic Gene Regulators in Cardiovascular Diseases.  ;Epigenetic gene regulations can be considered as de-novo initiation of abnormal molecular signaling events whose regulation is otherwise required during normal or specific developmental stages of the organisms. Primarily, three different mechanisms have been identified to participate in epigenetic gene regulations which include, DNA methylation, non-coding RNA species (microRNAs [miRNA], and long non-coding RNAs [LNC-RNA]) and histone modifications. These de-novo epigenetic mechanisms have been associated with altered normal cellular functions which eventually facilitate normal cells to transition into an abnormal phenotype. Among the three modes of regulation, RNA species which are usually considered to be less stable, can be speculated to initiate instant alterations in gene expression compared to DNA methylation or histone modifications. However, LNC-RNAs appear to be more stable in the cells than the other RNA species. Moreover, there is increasing literature which clearly suggests that a single specific LNC-RNA can regulate multiple mechanisms and disease phenotypes. With specific focus on cardiovascular diseases, here we attempt to provide UpToDate information on the functional role of miRNAs and LNC-RNAs. Here we discuss the role of these epigenetic mediators in different components of cardiovascular disease which include physiopathological heart development, athersclerosis, retenosis, diabetic hearts, myocardial infarction, ischemia-reperfusion, heart valve disease, aortic aneurysm, osteogenesis, angiogenesis and hypoxia in the heart. While there is abundant literature support that shows the involvement of many LNC-RNAs and miRNAs in cardiovascular diseases, very few RNA species have been identified which regulate epigenetic mechanisms which is the current focus in this article. Understanding the role of these RNA species in regulating epigenetic mechanisms in different cell types causing cardiovascular disease, would advance the field and promote disease prevention approaches that are aimed to target epigenetic mechanisms.  
Pregnancy Outcomes in Patients With Heart Disease in China.  ;To analyze pregnancy outcomes of patients with heart disease in a single center and to explore the risk factors of adverse outcomes. One thousand thirty-three pregnant women with heart disease were retrospectively included from 2010 to 2017. We collected data of maternal, obstetric, and fetal outcomes. Among 1,086 pregnancies, 295 (27.1%) with congenital heart disease, 244 (22.5%) with rheumatic heart disease, 387 (35.6%) with arrhythmia, and 55 (5.1%) with cardiomyopathy. There were 8 (0.7%) maternal deaths. Risk factors of mortality were New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification IV (p <0.001), cardiac surgery during pregnancy (p <0.001), and general anesthesia (p <0.001). Maternal cardiac complications occurred in 6.7% of women, with most in the cardiomyopathy (26.0%) and rheumatic heart disease (32.9%) groups. Multivariate logistic regression modeling was used to analyze the potential risk factors. NYHA classification III and IV independently predicted worse maternal outcomes. Peripartum intensive care unit admission rate was 10.2%. Admission to intensive care unit was associated with NYHA classification II/III/IV, modified World Health Organization (mWHO) classification II-III/III/IV, and cardiac surgery during pregnancy. In conclusion, pregnancy with heart disease is at higher risk of complications for both women and neonates. In our findings, maternal morbidity is associated with NYHA classification and mWHO classification.  
"Usefulness of Mitral Regurgitant Volume Quantified Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging to Predict Left Ventricular Remodeling After Mitral Valve ""Correction"".  ";MRI studies have shown a tight correlation between mitral regurgitant volume and left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LV EDV) in patients with primary chronic mitral regurgitation (MR). They have also shown a tight correlation between regurgitant volume and the decrease in LVEDV following mitral valve surgery. The purpose of this study is to validate an empiric calculation that can be used preoperatively to predict the amount of left ventricular remodeling following mitral valve correction. This is a prospective multicenter study of 63 (61 ± 13 years, male 65%) patients who underwent an MRI before and after mitral valve correction. Pre and postmitral valve correction ventricular volumes and ejection fractions were quantified. The predicted change in LV EDV was empirically calculated as mitral regurgitant volume/left ventricular ejection fraction. The observed change in LV EDV was compared to the predicted change in LV EDV. The LVEDV decreased in 61 (97%) patients following mitral valve correction (237 ± 66 ml vs 164 ± 46 ml, p <0.0001). Correlation between the observed and predicted change in LVEDV was good for the entire cohort (r = 0.77, p <0.0001) and excellent in patients with <10 ml of residual MR (r = 0.87, p <0.0001). This tight correlation was seen in both patients with primary (0.86, p <0.0001) and secondary MR (0.97, p <0.0001) and <10 ml of residual MR. Multivariate predictors of LV remodeling were MR volume, primary MR, and LVESV. In conclusion cardiac MRI volumetric measurements accurately predict LV remodeling following mitral valve correction. This finding supports the notion that MRI accurately quantifies the severity of chronic mitral regurgitation and a cardiac MRI should be strongly considered before mitral valve correction.  
Surface modification of polymer textile biomaterials by N(2) supercritical jet: Preliminary mechanical and biological performance assessment.  ;Foreign Body Reaction (FBR) is a critical issue to be addressed when polyethylene terephthalate (PET) textile implants are considered in the medical field to treat pathologies involving hernia repair, revascularization strategies in arterial disease, and aneurysm or heart valve replacement. The natural porosity of textile materials tends to induce exaggerated tissue ingrowth which may prevent the implants from remaining flexible. One hypothesized way to limit the FBR process is to increase the material surface roughness at the yarn level. Supercritical N2 (ScN2) jet particle projection is a technique that provides enough velocity to particles in order to induce plastic deformation on the impacted surface. This work investigates the influence of ScN2 jet projection parameters like standoff distance or particle size on the roughness that can be obtained on medical polymer yarns of various diameters (100 and 400 μm) and woven textile surfaces obtained from a 100 μm yarn. Moreover, the mechanical and biological performances of the obtained modified textile material are assessed. Results bring out that with appropriate testing conditions (500 bars jet/500 mm distance between nozzle and PET textile) and particle size around 50 μm, it is possible to generate 20 μm large and 4 μm deep craters on a 100 μm monofilament PET yarn and fabric. Regarding the strength of the textile material, it is only slightly modified with the treatment process, as the tenacity of the yarns decreases by only 10%. Moreover, It is shown that the obtained structures tend to limit the adhesion and slow down the proliferation of human fibroblasts.  
Familial evaluation reveals a distinct genetic cause in a large Spanish family with neurofibromatosis 1 and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  ;Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by café-au-lait spots, intertriginous freckling, and multiple neurofibromas. Classically, it has been described that hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) may be a cardiovascular manifestation of neurofibromatosis 1, although the relationship between these two entities has not been fully established. We report a large Spanish family carrying a pathogenic truncating variant in NF1 (p.Arg2258Ter) causing neurofibromatosis 1, and a pathogenic missense variant in MYH7 (p. Arg453Cys), causing hypertrophic cardiomyopathy independently. A complete penetrance was observed in both genetic diseases, reinforcing the notion of deleterious effects of both rare variants. According to our report, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in patients with NF1 should not be considered as part of the clinical spectrum in all cases. A careful and comprehensive assessment, including family evaluation and genetic testing for HCM should be considered as part of the diagnostic work-up in individuals presenting with both phenotypes.  
Cardiovascular surgery in Turner syndrome - early outcome and long-term follow-up.  ;BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in patients with Turner syndrome (TS), and cardiovascular surgery is frequently required for management of these patients. TS is associated with medical comorbidities than can complicate the care of this patient population. AIM: To describe the cardiovascular surgical outcomes of patients with TS. METHODS: A retrospective case series was compiled of 51 consecutive TS patients who had at least one cardiovascular surgery at Mayo Clinic Rochester from 1977-2017. The baseline clinical data of these patients were reviewed including demographics, medical comorbidities, congenital heart disease history, and medications. Echocardiographic reports were analyzed in detail. Operative reports and surgical hospital courses were reviewed. Long-term mortality was determined using medical records and the Social Security Death Index. Survival analysis was performed with the Kaplan Meier method. RESULTS: The cohort comprised 51 TS patients, average age at the time of surgery at Mayo Clinic was 28 (8-41) years, and 23 (45%) patients were under the age of 18. At the time of first Mayo Clinic surgery, 18 (35%) patients had previously undergone cardiac surgery at another institution. The most common procedures were repair of aortic coarctation in 14 (28%) patients, aortic valve replacement in 6 (12%) patients, and composite aortic root/ascending aorta replacement in 7 (14%) patients, with 7 patients undergoing repair of more than one lesion. Aortic dissection required operative intervention in 5 patients. After initial Mayo Clinic surgery, subsequent operations were required in 6 (13%) patients. Average hospital length of stay was 6 ± 2 d. There were 4 (8%) early surgical deaths. Freedom from death was 97% and 89% at 10 and 20 years, and the freedom from reoperation was 93% and 81% at 10 and 20 years. CONCLUSION: Cardiovascular surgery is associated with 8% early mortality given the medical complexity of TS patients. Those who survive to dismissal have good survival. Later cardiovascular reoperations are not rare.

Williams-Beuren Syndrome: The Role of Cardiac CT in Diagnosis.  ;Williams-Beuren syndrome is a multisystem genetic disorder associated with cardiovascular abnormalities, the most common of which is some variation of arterial stenosis. We describe a case of Williams-Beuren syndrome with multiple cardiovascular structural and arterial abnormalities and demonstrate the unique role of cardiac computed tomography in diagnosis.  
Phenotyping Left Ventricular Obstruction With Postprandial Re-Test Echocardiography in Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy.  ;Dynamic left ventricular (LV) obstruction has important clinical and therapeutic implications in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HC). Although absent at rest, LV obstruction may be elicited using varying stressors. Meal-related hemodynamic changes may favor LV obstruction and support postprandial (PP) symptoms in HC patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate PP-LV obstruction inducibility in HC patients in comparison with fasting Valsalva maneuver and exercise test. Ninety-two HC patients without LV obstruction underwent at-rest Transthoracic Echocardiography (TTE) during Valsalva maneuver and exercise test under fasting condition followed by at-rest re-test PP-TTE 30 to 60 minutes after a standardized midday meal. LV obstruction was noted and classified as being related to systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the mitral valve (SAM-related) and/or non-SAM-related (mid-cavity or apical), and intraventricular gradient was measured. At-rest re-test PP-TTE showed significant intraventricular gradient (>30 mm Hg) in 68 patients (60 SAM-related, 8 non-SAM related, 30 combined) with a higher prevalence (74%) of HC phenotype re-classified as obstructive compared with the fasting Valsalva maneuver (23%) or exercise test (33%) (p < 0.001). At multivariate analysis, a clinical history of PP symptoms and mitral anterior leaflet length and/or LV outflow ratio >2 were independently correlated with PP-TTE obstruction. In conclusion, PP TTE re-test is a simple and effective approach to unmask latent LV dynamic obstruction in daily clinical practice over fasting Valsalva maneuver or exercise test. PP clinical phenotype refinement may be relevant in targeting and evaluating HC therapy.

Restructuring Structural Heart Disease Practice During the COVID-19 Pandemic: JACC Review Topic of the Week.  ;"Patients with structural heart disease are at increased risk of adverse outcomes from the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) due to advanced age and comorbidity. In the midst of a global pandemic of a novel infectious disease, reality-based considerations comprise an important starting point for formulating clinical management pathways. The aims of these ""crisis-driven"" recommendations are: 1) to ensure appropriate and timely treatment of structural heart disease patients; 2) to minimize the risk of COVID-19 exposure to patients and health care workers; and 3) to limit resource utilization under conditions of constraint. Although the degree of disruption to usual practice will vary across the United States and elsewhere, we hope that early experiences from a heart team operating in the current global epicenter of COVID-19 may prove useful for others adapting their practice in advance of local surges of COVID-19.

Distinctive Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Anatomy and Obstructive Physiology in Patients Admitted With Takotsubo Syndrome.  ;Clinical spectrum of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HC) has been expanded to include patients with mild or no thickening of the left ventricle (LV), who nevertheless have outflow tract obstruction at rest or after exercise, due to systolic anterior motion (SAM) and ventricular septal contact, with mitral valve elongation and papillary muscles anomalies. Apical ballooning mimicking a takotsubo syndrome (TS) wall motion pattern can occur in HC with mild septal thickening when latent obstruction becomes unrelenting. To define the prevalence of anatomic abnormalities characteristic of HC in patients diagnosed with TS, we analyzed echocardiograms of 44 unselected TS patients, age 67±12 years, 95% women including studies performed before the event (n = 11, median 515 days) and after recovery of left ventricular function (n = 33, median 92 days, interquartile range = 29 to 327) and compared the findings to 60 age and sexed matched controls. Analysis of echocardiograms was blinded to event timing, and patient vs. control status. During the ballooning event, 13 patients (30%) had SAM including 9 with LV outflow obstruction, peak gradients 71±40 mmHg, as well as: ventricular septal thickening (16 ± 4 mm), elongated anterior leaflets (30 ± 3mm), and increased mitral coaptation to posterior wall distance (17 ± 5 mm), consistent with diagnosis of the HC phenotype. Compared to 31 TS patients without SAM, study patients with SAM had longer anterior leaflets (30 ± 3 vs 26 ± 4 mm, p = 0.006), thicker septum (16 ± 4 vs 12 ± 3 mm), increased coaptation to posterior wall distance (17 ± 5 vs 14 ± 4 mm, p < 0.04) and reduced distance from coaptation to septum (19 ± 5 vs 27 ± 5, p < 0.001). In the 13 patients with SAM, morphologic characteristics of HC persisted after normalization of LV function. In conclusion, a subset of patients experiencing TS events demonstrates a constellation of morphologic abnormalities characteristic of HC that persist after recovery of LV wall motion. These findings suggest that dynamic outflow obstruction may cause apical ballooning in susceptible patients.  
Low risk TAVR: Long- term considerations and appropriate patient selection.  ;Recent trials have shown impressive results in low-risk patients undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR) with low procedural complication rates, short hospital length of stay, zero mortality, and zero disabling stroke at 30 days and have led to a Food and Drug Administration indication for TAVR in these patients. The long-term data on subclinical leaflet thrombosis, valve durability, effects of pacemaker implantation, right ventricular pacing, and progressive paravalvular leak is unclear. We describe clinical and procedural considerations for patient selection and introduce future potential procedural challenges. Finally, we discuss the importance of considering life expectancy and durability prior to TAVR in this low risk relatively young cohort and emphasize the importance of a heart team approach.  
What do we know about the role of lipoprotein(a) in atherogenesis 57 years after its discovery?  ;Elevated circulating concentrations of lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is strongly associated with increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) and degenerative aortic stenosis. This relationship was first observed in prospective observational studies, and the causal relationship was confirmed in genetic studies. Everybody should have their Lp(a) concentration measured once in their lifetime. CVD risk is elevated when Lp(a) concentrations are high i.e. > 50 mg/dL (≥100 mmol/L). Extremely high Lp(a) levels >180 mg/dL (≥430 mmol/L) are associated with CVD risk similar to that conferred by familial hypercholesterolemia. Elevated Lp(a) level was previously treated with niacin, which exerts a potent Lp(a)-lowering effect. However, niacin is currently not recommended because, despite the improvement in lipid profile, no improvements on clinical outcomes have been observed. Furthermore, niacin use has been associated with severe adverse effects. Post hoc analyses of clinical trials with proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type-9 (PCSK9) inhibitors have shown that these drugs exert clinical benefits by lowering Lp(a), independent of their potent reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). It is not yet known whether PCSK9 inhibitors will be of clinical use in patients with elevated Lp(a). Apheresis is a very effective approach to Lp(a) reduction, which reduces CVD risk but is invasive and time-consuming and is thus reserved for patients with very high Lp(a) levels and progressive CVD. Studies are ongoing on the practical application of genetic approaches to therapy, including antisense oligonucleotides against apolipoprotein(a) and small interfering RNA (siRNA) technology, to reduce the synthesis of Lp(a).  
Combined Degenerative Mitral Valve and Coronary Surgery: Early Outcomes and 10-Year Survival.  ;BACKGROUND: This study investigated the impact of combined degenerative mitral valve (DMV) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG+DMV) surgery vs DMV surgery only on in-hospital health outcome and 10-year survival. METHODS: We identified 745 patients with DMV disease. Of these, 186 (24.9%) were affected also by coronary disease and underwent combined DMV+CABG. They were compared with the remaining 559 patients receiving DMV-only surgery in in-hospital and 1-, 5-, and 10-year survival. We evaluated a short-term composite outcome of hospital mortality, acute kidney injury, cerebrovascular events, and low cardiac output requiring postoperative use of intraaortic balloon pump. In addition, we assessed mitral valve repair rates over time and their correlation with long-term survival. To minimize bias, we conducted a propensity score-matching analysis. RESULTS: DMV+CABG surgery was associated with a similar incidence of the composite end point compared with DMV-only surgery in the unmatched analysis (6.5% vs 5.4%, P = .71) and matched analysis (7.5% vs 8.2%, P = .82). The 10-year survival was 70.5% vs 68.6% (P = .07) for the unmatched analysis and 64.6% vs 62.5% (P = .9) for the matched analysis, DMV+CABG vs DMV-only, respectively. Mitral valve repair had a beneficial effect on short-term outcomes and long-term mortality rates, regardless the presence of concomitant coronary surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Combined DMV+CABG surgery is a very effective surgical treatment with high mitral valve repair rate. Early in-hospital outcome and long-term survival are comparable with DMV-only surgery. In these combined procedures, mitral valve repair is associated with better long-term survival.  
Proportion and risk factors of cholesterol crystal embolization after cardiovascular procedures: a retrospective national database study.  ;Cholesterol crystal embolization (CCE) is a rare, mainly iatrogenic condition. The proportion of CCE after cardiovascular procedures has not been fully elucidated. The purpose of this study was to determine the proportion of CCE diagnosed after cardiovascular procedures and to identify risk factors for CCE occurrence. Data on patients aged older than 40 years who underwent cardiovascular procedures between July 2010 and March 2017 were extracted from the Japanese Diagnosis Procedure Combination database. Inpatients diagnosed with CCE within 1 year after procedures in the same hospital were identified. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with the occurrence of CCE. There were 962 patients with CCE in 2,190,300 patients who underwent cardiovascular procedures. The overall proportion of CCE after cardiovascular procedures was 4.4 per 10,000 patients (95% confidence interval 4.1-4.7). The overall in-hospital mortality among patients with CCE was 11% (107/962). Older age, male sex, smoking, heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and aortic aneurism and dissection were significantly associated with the higher occurrence of CCE. Compared with cardioangiography, several procedures were significantly associated with higher occurrence of CCE, including intra-aortic balloon pumping, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of the renal artery, and transcatheter aortic valve implantation or balloon aortic valvuloplasty. CCE is rare but remains a severe complication of cardiovascular procedures. Atherosclerotic risk factors and certain cardiovascular procedures were associated with CCE.  
Identification of known and unknown genes associated with mitral valve prolapse using an exome slice methodology.  ;PURPOSE: Although a familial distribution has been documented, the genetic aetiology of mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is largely unknown, with only four genes identified so far: FLNA, DCHS1, DZIP1 and PLD1. The aim of this study was to evaluate the genetic yield in known causative genes and to identify possible novel genes associated with MVP using a heart gene panel based on exome sequencing. METHODS: Patients with MVP were referred for genetic counselling when a positive family history for MVP was reported and/or Barlow's disease was diagnosed. In total, 101 probands were included to identify potentially pathogenic variants in a set of 522 genes associated with cardiac development and/or diseases. RESULTS: 97 (96%) probands were classified as Barlow's disease and 4 (4%) as fibroelastic deficiency. Only one patient (1%) had a likely pathogenic variant in the known causative genes (DCHS1). However, an interesting finding was that 10 probands (11%) had a variant that was classified as likely pathogenic in six different, mostly cardiomyopathy genes: DSP (1×), HCN4 (1×), MYH6 (1×), TMEM67 (1×), TRPS1 (1×) and TTN (5×). CONCLUSION: Exome slice sequencing analysis performed in MVP probands reveals a low genetic yield in known causative genes but may expand the cardiac phenotype of other genes. This study suggests for the first time that also genes related to cardiomyopathy may be associated with MVP. This highlights the importance to screen these patients and their family for the presence of arrhythmias and of 'disproportionate' LV remodelling as compared with the severity of mitral regurgitation, unravelling a possible coexistent cardiomyopathy.  
Nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis of a bioprosthetic valve: Questions to ponder before replacement of the valve.  ;"Nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE) of bioprosthetic valves is extremely rare. We report a 67-year-old lady with early bioprosthetic ""failure"" that at reoperation was proven to be NBTE. The choice of a prosthesis in this condition may have implications for patients' late clinical course.  "

Cecal bascule after cardiac surgery: A case report.  ;Cecal bascule is a form of volvulus resulting from upward and anterior cecal folding, and accounts for 0.01% of adult large bowel obstructions. With a competent ileocecal valve, cecal bascule may progress to closed loop obstruction, ischemia, gangrene, or perforation. Failure to treat cecal bascule has a mortality of 50%. Nonoperative management includes nasogastric and colonoscopic decompression, with a 95% failure rate. The gold standard is right hemicolectomy with a near nonexistent recurrence rate. Severe gastrointestinal complications following cardiothoracic surgery may lead to increased morbidity, length of stay, and mortality. Here, we present the first reported case of cecal bascule following cardiac surgery.  
Midline unifocalization for pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect and major aortopulmonary collateral arteries.  ;BACKGROUND: Pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect and major aortopulmonary collateral arteries (PA/VSD/MAPCAs) is a relatively rare and extremely heterogeneous form of congenital heart disease. Despite vast improvements in the surgical management of this disease, there is still an ongoing controversy regarding the optimal treatment. The purpose of this chapter is to summarize the surgical algorithm used at Stanford University with a special focus on midline unifocalization. METHODS: We have an experience with well over 300 patients undergoing primary surgical treatment of PA/VSD/MAPCAs. There were three pathways employed to accommodate the various forms of this heart defect. The dominant pathway is midline unifocalization, which was utilized in 80% of all patients. Less frequently employed strategies included creation of an aortopulmonary window (15%), and other approaches (5%). RESULTS: For the patients who underwent a midline unifocalization, 85% had a single-stage complete repair while 15% had a unifocalization and shunt. The operative mortality was 1.5% for the single-stage complete repair group vs. 8% for the unifocalization/shunt group. Ultimately, 97% of the midline unifocalization patients were repaired. However, the mean right ventricle to aortic pressure ratio was lower in patients who had a single-stage complete repair compared with an initial unifocalization/shunt (0.36±0.09 vs. 0.42±0.07). CONCLUSIONS: The surgical treatment of PA/VSD/MAPCAs is made more complicated due to heterogeneity of MAPCA and pulmonary artery anatomy. The algorithm utilized at Stanford takes into account the anatomic heterogeneity and the results demonstrate that a high percentage of patients achieve full repair.  
Surgical outcomes in complex adult congenital heart disease: a brief review.  ;Life expectancy of patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) continues to increase dramatically over the last few decades, primarily due to significant medical and surgical advancements in the field. Adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) patients are now living longer but continue to face morbidity and reduced long-term survival when compared to the general population. We briefly describe the growth of ACHD with a focus on surgical procedures and outcomes in the more complex lesions including Tetralogy of Fallot, Ebsteins Anomaly of the tricuspid valve, Coarctation of the Aorta, Transposition of the Great Arteries and single ventricle lesions. The advancing role of mechanical circulatory support and cardiac transplantation in ACHD patients is also highlighted. Cardiac surgery in these patients continues to improve with low surgical mortality rate and outstanding long-term outcomes and efficacy.  
Reinforced Ross operation and intermediate to long term follow up.  ;The Ross operation for aortic valve replacement continues to be a controversial option because of concerns related to late autograft dilation and progressive neo-aortic regurgitation. We described a technique in 2005 to address this problem, in which we place the entire autograft in a Dacron tube which makes it theoretically unlikely, if not impossible, for it to dilate-the reinforced Ross procedure. Since 2004, we have operated on 25 patients using this technique. Median length of follow-up in our cohort was 6 years, with 14 patients having 5 years or more of follow-up. Our data demonstrate the externally supported, or reinforced Ross technique using a straight graft is a safe and effective technique in older children, adolescents, and young adult patients. At intermediate follow-up, patients who underwent a reinforced Ross technique were less likely to have neoaortic root dilatation.  
Ebstein's anomaly: contemporary management strategies.  ;Ebstein's anomaly (EA) is a rare congenital cardiac anomaly. It is a disease at a minimum of the tricuspid valve (TV) and the right ventricular myocardium. Presentation varies from a severe symptomatic form during the neonatal period to an incidental detection later in life due to the wide morphological variation of the condition. The neonatal presentation can be severe and every attempt should be made at medical management ideally into infancy and early childhood. Neonates not eligible or failing medical management should be surgically managed either with a single ventricle palliative approach or a more desirable biventricular repair with a neonatal TV valvuloplasty. Some neonates initially committed to a single ventricle pathway may be converted to a biventricular repair by a delayed TV valvuloplasty. The da Silva Cone repair has become the valvuloplasty of choice especially beyond the neonatal period and can be applied to a wide morphological variation of the condition with good long-term durability. If the chance of a successful TV valvuloplasty is high, it should be offered early in childhood to prevent further cardiac dilation. Adding a Bidirectional Glenn to a valvuloplasty may help salvage marginal risk patients or marginally repairable valves. If valve replacement is the only option, a bioprosthetic valve should be used as it is less thrombogenic especially with marginal right ventricular function. Heart transplantation should be considered in patients with associated left ventricular dysfunction.  
Establishing a pre-clinical growing animal model to test a tissue engineered valved pulmonary conduit.  ;BACKGROUND: Many valvular pathologies of the heart may be only sufficiently treated by replacement of the valve if a reconstruction is not feasible. However, structural deterioration, thrombosis with thromboembolic events and infective endocarditis are commonly encountered complications over time and often demand a re-operation. In congenital heart disease the lack of small diameter valves with the potential to grow poses additional challenges and limits treatment options to homo- or xenograft implants. METHODS: In this study, a chronic sheep model (24 months follow-up), a self-constructed valved conduit was created out of a tissue engineered (TE) patch (CorMatrix® Cardiovascular, Inc, USA) and implanted in orthotopic right ventricular (RV)-pulmonary artery (PA) position. Thereafter, the sheep were regularly monitored by clinical, laboratory and echocardiographic examinations to evaluate cardiac function and the implanted RV-PA-conduit. DISCUSSION: Here, we summarize the study protocol and our experiences during the perioperative phase and the follow up period and explain how we constructed a valved conduit out of a commercially available TE patch.

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement with Lotus and Sapien 3 prosthetic valves: a systematic review and meta-analysis.  ;"BACKGROUND: Frequent occurrence of paravalvular leak (PVL) after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) was the main concern with early-generation devices and focused technological improvements. Current systematic review and meta-analysis sought to compare outcomes of TAVR for severe native valve stenosis with next-generation devices: Lotus and Sapien 3. METHODS: Electronic databases were screened for studies comparing outcomes of TAVR with Lotus and Sapien 3. In a random-effects meta-analysis, the pooled incidence rates of procedural, clinical and functional outcomes according to VARC-2 definitions were assessed. RESULTS: Eleven observational studies including 2,836 patients (Lotus N=862 vs. Sapien 3 N=1,974) met inclusion criteria. No differences were observed regarding composite endpoints-device success and early safety. Similarly, 30-day mortality, major vascular complications, acute kidney injury and serious bleeding events were similar with both devices. Lotus valve demonstrated 35% reduction of the risk for mild PVL: risk ratio (RR) 0.65, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.49-0.85, P=0.002; but there were no statistical differences with regard to moderate/severe PVL (RR 0.56, 95% CI: 0.18-1.77, P=0.320). Lotus valves produced significantly higher mean transaortic gradients: mean difference (MD) 0.88 mmHg, 95% CI, 0.24-1.53 mmHg, P=0.007; however, without translation into higher rate of prosthesis-patient mismatch (RR 1.10, 95% CI: 0.82-1.47, P=0.540). As compared to Sapien 3, Lotus device placement was associated with significantly higher rate of permanent pacemaker implantation (RR 2.30, 95% CI: 1.95-2.71, P<0.00001) and cerebrovascular events (RR 1.76, 95% CI: 1.03-2.99, P=0.040). CONCLUSIONS: Lotus valve, as compared with Sapien 3, was associated with lower risk for PVL but higher risk for permanent pacemaker implantation and cerebrovascular events.  "
A new simplified technique for artificial chordae implantation in mitral valve repair with its early results.  ;BACKGROUND: Many techniques in mitral valve repair (MVR) have been reported with successful long-term results. The aim of this study is to present our simplified technique in artificial chordae replacement for MVR, and reporting its short-term outcomes. METHODS: We present a prospective single-surgeon experience. A new simplified artificial chordae implantation technique has been used to repair mitral valves. Postoperative echocardiography at 0, 6, then every 12 months is used to control the results. Endpoints involved freedom from mitral regurgitation (MR), reoperation and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE). RESULTS: Between 01/2016 and 01/2018, 57 consecutive patients undergo MVR using this technique are evaluated. Mean age was 63.6±10.1 years and 68.4% were male. Mitral valve pathology was mainly degenerative (52, 91.2%) or healed endocarditis (5, 8.8%). Besides chordae replacement (3.6±1.1 per patient), annuloplasty was used in all patients to correct annulus dilation and stabilize the repair. Mean cross-clamping time was 53±13.4 minutes in isolated MVR and 69.4±31.1 minutes in concomitant procedures. Postoperative outcomes reported two mortalities. Discharge echocardiography reported mild MR in 4 patients and the rest of patients had non-to trace regurgitation. Follow-up results within a mean of 19.3±8.5 months reported no significant MR or need for reoperation and three more (non-valve related) mortalities. CONCLUSIONS: Our simplified technique allows to reduce the number of used chordae and re-correction if needed, which consequently reduces cross-clamping and bypass time especially in endoscopic MVR. Good intraoperative and short-term results are reported. These results are still under investigation to prove long-term stability of the repair.

Comparison of Benefit of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation in Patients With Low Gradient Versus High Gradient Aortic Stenosis and Left Ventricular Dysfunction.  ;"Patients with low gradient severe aortic stenosis (LG-AS) often exhibit significant limitations in functional status and quality of life. We aimed to evaluate the clinical effect of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) on LG-AS patients compared to those with high transvalvular gradients and similar left ventricular dysfunction. Retrospective analysis of records for all patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction <50% who underwent TAVI at our institution was performed. Patients were grouped according to their transvalvular gradient. Data were collected from The Society of Thoracic Surgeons/American College of Cardiology Transcatheter Valve Therapy Registry. Clinical benefit endpoints included improvements in left ventricular ejection fraction and changes in the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire. Additional outcomes analyzed included 1-year all-cause mortality, stroke rates, rates of rehospitalization, need for a permanent pacemaker, and hospital length of stay. Two hundred three patients met our inclusion criteria. one hundred one LG-AS patients (mean transvalvular gradient <40 mm Hg) were compared to 102 patients with high transvalvular gradients (mean transvalvular gradient >40 mm Hg). LG-AS patients yielded similar improvements in left ventricular ejection fraction (43.5% ± 63.7 vs 37.7% ± 58.7; p = 0.525) and Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire scores (423.51% ± 1257.02 vs 266.56% ± 822.81; p = 0.352). There were no differences between the groups with respect to 1-year mortality (16.8% vs 12.7%; p = 0.412), stroke rates, hospital length of stay, need for permanent pacemaker implantation or hospital readmissions. In conclusion, we found that TAVI is associated with comparable improvement in clinical and echocardiographic outcomes in LG-AS patients as compared to those with high gradient severe aortic stenosis.

Mechanism of Eccentric Cardiomyocyte Hypertrophy Secondary to Severe Mitral Regurgitation.  ;BACKGROUND: Primary valvular heart disease is a prevalent cause of morbidity and mortality in both industrialized and developing countries. Although the primary consequence of valvular heart disease is myocardial dysfunction, treatment of valvular heart diseases centers around valve repair or replacement rather than prevention or reversal of myocardial dysfunction. This is particularly evident in primary mitral regurgitation (MR), which invariably results in eccentric hypertrophy and left ventricular (LV) failure in the absence of timely valve repair or replacement. The mechanism of LV dysfunction in primary severe MR is entirely unknown. METHODS: Here, we developed the first mouse model of severe MR. Valvular damage was achieved by severing the mitral valve leaflets and chords with iridectomy scissors, and MR was confirmed by echocardiography. Serial echocardiography was performed to follow up LV morphology and systolic function. Analysis of cardiac tissues was subsequently performed to evaluate valve deformation, cardiomyocyte morphology, LV fibrosis, and cell death. Finally, dysregulated pathways were assessed by RNA-sequencing analysis and immunofluorescence. RESULTS: In the ensuing 15 weeks after the induction of MR, gradual LV dilatation and dysfunction occurred, resulting in severe systolic dysfunction. Further analysis revealed that severe MR resulted in a marked increase in cardiac mass and increased cardiomyocyte length but not width, with electron microscopic evidence of sarcomere disarray and the development of sarcomere disruption. From a mechanistic standpoint, severe MR resulted in activation of multiple components of both the mammalian target of rapamycin and calcineurin pathways. Inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin signaling preserved sarcomeric structure and prevented LV remodeling and systolic dysfunction. Immunohistochemical analysis uncovered a differential pattern of expression of the cell polarity regulator Crb2 (crumbs homolog 2) along the longitudinal axis of cardiomyocytes and close to the intercalated disks in the MR hearts. Electron microscopy images demonstrated a significant increase in polysome localization in close proximity to the intercalated disks and some areas along the longitudinal axis in the MR hearts. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that LV dysfunction in response to severe MR is a form of maladaptive eccentric cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and outline the link between cell polarity regulation and spatial localization protein synthesis as a pathway for directional cardiomyocyte growth.  
Insights from circulating microRNAs in cardiovascular entities in turner syndrome patients.  ;"BACKGROUND: Turner syndrome (TS) is a chromosomal disorder, in which a female is partially or entirely missing one of the two X chromosomes, with a prevalence of 1:2500 live female births. The present study aims to identify a circulating microRNA (miRNA) signature for TS patients with and without congenital heart disease (CHD). METHODS: Microarray platform interrogating 2549 miRNAs were used to detect the miRNA abundance levels in the blood of 33 TS patients and 14 age-matched healthy volunteer controls (HVs). The differentially abundant miRNAs between the two groups were further validated by RT-qPCR. RESULTS: We identified 60 differentially abundant miRNA in the blood of TS patients compared to HVs, from which, 41 and 19 miRNAs showed a higher and a lower abundance levels in TS patients compared to HVs, respectively. RT-qPCR confirmed the significantly higher abundance levels of eight miRNAs namely miR-374b-5p, miR-199a-5p, miR-340-3p, miR-125b-5p, miR-30e-3p, miR-126-3p, miR-5695, and miR-26b-5p in TS patients as compared with the HVs. The abundance level of miR-5695 was higher in TS patients displaying CHD as compared to TS patients without CHD (p = 0.0265; log2-fold change 1.99); whereas, the abundance level of miR-126-3p was lower in TS patients with congenital aortic valve disease (AVD) compared to TS patients without BAV (p = 0.0139, log2-fold change 1.52). The clinical feature statistics revealed that miR-126-3p had a significant correlation with sinotubular junction Z-score (r = 0.42; p = 0.0154). CONCLUSION: The identified circulating miRNAs signature for TS patients with manifestations associated with cardiovascular diseases provide new insights into the molecular mechanism of TS that may guide the development of novel diagnostic approaches.

Congenital Supravalvar Mitral Ring - A Case Report.  ;"Congenital mitral valve stenosis is a rare and severe disease, usually associated with other heart defects. The appropriate intervention depends on the site and mechanism of valvular obstruction and the aim is to avoid or delay valve replacement since it is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Early single-stage complete repair is associated with better prognosis. We report the case of a 20-month-old child with a supravalvar mitral ring combined with a ventricular septal defect; pulmonary arterial systolic pressure before the surgery was 79 mmHg. The patient underwent a successful surgical repair with good clinical resolution.  "
Valve Heart Surgery in Brazil - The BYPASS Registry Analysis.  ;OBJECTIVE: To analyze the profile and outcomes of patients who underwent valve heart surgery in Brazil, using information retrieved from the Brazilian Registry of Cardiovascular Surgeries in Adults (BYPASS Registry) database. METHODS: This is a multicenter cohort study, evaluating 920 patients submitted to heart valve surgery. Demographics and postoperative clinical outcomes were assessed and compared to estimate mortality risk using the European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation (EuroSCORE). RESULTS: Isolated aortic valve replacement was the most frequently performed surgery (34%), followed by isolated mitral valve replacement (24.9%). Valve repair was performed in 21% of mitral procedures. Minimally invasive access was performed in 1.6% and the most frequent postoperative complications were arrhythmias (22.6%), infections (5.7%), and low-output syndrome (5.1%). Operations covered by the public health system accounted for 80.8% and the hospital mortality rate was 7.3%. CONCLUSION: The most frequent isolated valve surgery in Brazil is the aortic valve replacement by conventional open access and the rheumatic disease is still the main etiology for valve surgery. The BYPASS Registry has a fundamental role to provide information on the profile of patients with valve heart disease in our country in order to delineate adequate strategies for health promotion and resource allocation for cardiac surgery.  
National Trends in Utilization and In-Hospital Outcomes of Surgical Aortic Valve Replacements in Spain, 2001-2015.  ;"OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to examine the incidence and in-hospital outcomes of surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) and to identify factors associated with in-hospital mortality (IHM) among patients according to the type of implanted valve used in SAVR. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study using the Spanish National Hospital Discharge Database, 2001-2015. We included patients who had SAVR listed as a procedure in their discharge report. RESULTS: We identified 86,578 patients who underwent SAVR (52.78% mechanical and 47.22% bioprosthetic). Incidence of SAVR coding increased significantly from 11.95 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in 2001 to 17.92 in 2015 (P<0.001). Age and comorbidities increased over time (P<0.001). There was a significant increase in the frequency of concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and in the use of pacemaker implantation. The use of mechanical SAVR decreased and the use of bioprosthetic valves increased over time. IHM decreased over time (from 8.13% in 2001-05 to 5.39% in 2011-15). Patients who underwent mechanical SAVR had higher IHM than those who underwent bioprosthetic SAVR (7.44% vs. 6%; P<0.05). Higher IHM rates were associated with advanced age, female sex, comorbidities, concomitant CABG, and the use of mechanical SAVR (OR 1.67; 95% CI 1.57-1.77). CONCLUSION: The number of SAVRs performed in Spain has increased since 2001. The use of mechanical SAVR has decreased and the use of bioprosthetic valves has increased over time. IHM has decreased over time for both types of valves and despite a concomitant increase in age and comorbidities of patients during the same period.  "

Triglycerides and remnant cholesterol associated with risk of aortic valve stenosis: Mendelian randomization in the Copenhagen General Population Study.  ;"AIMS: We tested the hypothesis that higher levels of plasma triglycerides and remnant cholesterol are observationally and genetically associated with increased risk of aortic valve stenosis. METHODS AND RESULTS: We included 108 559 individuals from the Copenhagen General Population Study. Plasma triglycerides, remnant cholesterol (total cholesterol minus low-density lipoprotein and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol), and 16 genetic variants causing such increased or decreased levels were determined. Incident aortic valve stenosis occurred in 1593 individuals. Observationally compared to individuals with triglycerides <1 mmol/L (<89 mg/dL), the multifactorially adjusted hazard ratio for aortic valve stenosis was 1.02 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.87-1.19] for individuals with triglycerides of 1.0-1.9 mmol/L (89-176 mg/dL), 1.22 (1.02-1.46) for 2.0-2.9 mmol/L (177-265 mg/dL), 1.40 (1.11-1.77) for 3.0-3.9 mmol/L (266-353 mg/dL), 1.29 (0.88-1.90) for 4.0-4.9 mmol/L (354-442 mg/dL), and 1.52 (1.02-2.27) for individuals with triglycerides ≥5 mmol/L (≥443 mg/dL). By age 85, the cumulative incidence of aortic valve stenosis was 5.1% for individuals with plasma triglycerides <2.0 mmol/L (77 mg/dL), 6.5% at 2.0-4.9 mmol/L (177-442 mg/dL), and 8.2% for individuals with plasma triglycerides ≥5.0 mmol/L (443 mg/dL). The corresponding values for remnant cholesterol categories were 4.8% for <0.5 mmol/L (19 mg/dL), 5.6% for 0.5-1.4 mmol/L (19-57 mg/dL), and 7.4% for ≥1.5 mmol/L (58 mg/dL). Genetically, compared to individuals with allele score 13-16, odds ratios for aortic valve stenosis were 1.30 (95% CI 1.20-1.42; Δtriglycerides +12%; Δremnant cholesterol +11%) for allele score 17-18, 1.41 (1.31-1.52; +25%; +22%) for allele score 19-20, and 1.51 (1.22-1.86; +51%; +44%) for individuals with allele score 21-23. CONCLUSION: Higher triglycerides and remnant cholesterol were observationally and genetically associated with increased risk of aortic valve stenosis.  "
Multi-detector computed tomography in the assessment of tetralogy of Fallot patients: is it a must?  ;BACKGROUND: Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) accounts for 10% of all CHD. It classically consists of ventricular septal defect (VSD), aortic overriding, right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) obstruction, and RV hypertrophy. There are many anatomic variants, associated intracardiac and extracardiac anomalies that must be taken into consideration when imaging and planning the surgical procedure needed. Multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT), with its high spatial and temporal resolution, has a pivotal role in the evaluation of complex anatomical findings in both unrepaired and repaired TOF patients. MAIN BODY: Though MDCT has a limited role in the initial diagnosis of TOF, it is particularly important when there is a question about anatomy of pulmonary arteries (PAs) (whether sizable, hypoplastic, or atretic), presence of major aorto-pulmonary collaterals (MAPCAs) and presence of additional VSDs. Additionally, MDCT is crucial in the diagnosis of different anatomical variants of TOF. TOF patients with absent pulmonary valve classically have hugely dilated PAs which raise an important question about the degree and severity of airways compression. This question can be accurately answered by MDCT. TOF with double-outlet RV (DORV) has variable degrees of aortic override which can be assessed by MDCT. An atrio-ventricular septal defect (AVSD) is seen in about 13% of TOF cases and typically occurs in patients with Down syndrome. MDCT can assess the size and extent of inlet VSD and size of both ventricles (balanced or unbalanced AVSD). Coronary artery anomalies are common and important association. MDCT can identify the presence of a major coronary artery crossing the RVOT, a left anterior descending (LAD) from RCA, or a dual LAD. The clinical importance of these anomalies is its susceptibility to injury during ventriculotomy incision required for TOF repair necessitating changing the usual approach of surgery. Patients with reduced pulmonary blood flow undergo a systemic to pulmonary shunt. MDCT can assess the patency of the shunt, stenotic, or occluded segments. In surgically repaired TOF patients, MDCT can identify the sequalae and long-term complications including residual RVOT obstruction, conduit stenosis, RVOT patch aneurysm, RVH, and aortic root dilatation. CONCLUSION: MDCT is a safe and reliable imaging modality that provides accurate assessment of anatomical variants and associated anomalies of TOF.  
WorldwIde SurvEy on Clinical and Anatomical Factors Driving the Choice of Transcatheter Aortic Valve pRostheses.  ;Background: Following the success of the first human transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in 2002, multiple transcatheter heart valves (THVs) have become available. However, guidelines or expert consensus on how to optimize THV choice according to patients' anatomical and clinical characteristics is missing. This survey-based study aimed to identify patient-specific characteristics deemed important in the choice of THV type. Methods and results: A web-based survey including 39 questions was completed by 71 experienced TAVR operators from 23 countries with a median TAVR volume of 88 procedures in the year prior to survey completion (IQR 61-180). The survey covered five topics: access, aortic annulus/leaflets, aortic root, left ventricular function and clinical characteristics. Factors with the most impact on THV choice were reported to be a calcified sinotubular junction, valve-in-valve procedure, annular dimension >575 mm2, femoral diameter ≤ 5.0 mm, low coronary ostia, calcification at the annular level and/or protruding into the left ventricular outflow tract, and need for post TAVR PCI. Also, in case of off-label use of THVs to treat bicuspid aortic valve disease and isolated aortic regurgitation, the choice of THV type was reported to be important. Conclusions: This survey-based study identifies key patient characteristics that impact THV selection. As such, we present a guide, based on current practice, of which THV types are best suited to these different patient-specific characteristics. A patient-tailored THV choice is likely to optimize TAVR outcomes.

Echocardiographic reference ranges for normal left ventricular layer-specific strain: results from the EACVI NORRE study.  ;"AIMS : To obtain the normal range for 2D echocardiographic (2DE) measurements of left ventricular (LV) layer-specific strain from a large group of healthy volunteers of both genders over a wide range of ages. METHODS AND RESULTS : A total of 287 (109 men, mean age: 46 ± 14 years) healthy subjects were enrolled at 22 collaborating institutions of the EACVI Normal Reference Ranges for Echocardiography (NORRE) study. Layer-specific strain was analysed from the apical two-, three-, and four-chamber views using 2DE software. The lowest values of layer-specific strain calculated as ±1.96 standard deviations from the mean were -15.0% in men and -15.6% in women for epicardial strain, -16.8% and -17.7% for mid-myocardial strain, and -18.7% and -19.9% for endocardial strain, respectively. Basal-epicardial and mid-myocardial strain decreased with age in women (epicardial; P = 0.008, mid-myocardial; P = 0.003) and correlated with age (epicardial; r = -0.20, P = 0.007, mid-myocardial; r = -0.21, P = 0.006, endocardial; r = -0.23, P = 0.002), whereas apical-epicardial, mid-myocardial strain increased with the age in women (epicardial; P = 0.006, mid-myocardial; P = 0.03) and correlated with age (epicardial; r = 0.16, P = 0.04). End/Epi ratio at the apex was higher than at the middle and basal levels of LV in men (apex; 1.6 ± 0.2, middle; 1.2 ± 0.1, base 1.1 ± 0.1) and women (apex; 1.6 ± 0.1, middle; 1.1 ± 0.1, base 1.2 ± 0.1). CONCLUSION : The NORRE study provides useful 2DE reference ranges for novel indices of layer-specific strain.  "
Zinc ameliorates human aortic valve calcification through GPR39 mediated ERK1/2 signaling pathway.  ;AIMS: Calcific aortic valve disease is the most common heart valve disease in the Western world. It has been reported that zinc is accumulated in calcified human aortic valves. However, whether zinc directly regulates calcific aortic valve disease is yet to be elucidated. The present study sought to determine the potential role of zinc in the pathogenesis of calcific aortic valve disease. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using a combination of a human valve interstitial cell calcification model, human aortic valve tissues and blood samples, we report that 20 μM zinc supplementation attenuates human valve interstitial cell (hVIC) in vitro calcification, and that this is mediated through inhibition of apoptosis and osteogenic differentiation via the zinc sensing receptor GPR39-dependent ERK1/2 signaling pathway. Furthermore, we report that GPR39 protein expression is dramatically reduced in calcified human aortic valves, and there is a significant reduction in zinc serum levels in patients with calcific aortic valve disease. Moreover, we reveal that 20 μM zinc treatment prevents the reduction of GPR39 observed in calcified human valve interstitial cells. We also show that the zinc transporter ZIP13 and ZIP14 are significantly increased in hVICs in response to zinc treatment. Knockdown of ZIP13 or ZIP14 significantly inhibited hVIC in vitro calcification and osteogenic differentiation. CONCLUSIONS: Together, these findings suggest that zinc is a novel inhibitor of calcific aortic valve disease, and report that zinc transporter ZIP13 and ZIP14 are important regulators of hVIC in vitro calcification and osteogenic differentiation. Zinc supplementation may offer a potential therapeutic strategy for calcific aortic valve disease. TRANSLATIONAL PERSPECTIVE: This study reports that the zinc sensing receptor GPR39 expression is decreased in calcified human aortic valve tissues and there is a significant reduction in zinc serum levels in patients with calcific aortic valve disease. Zinc treatment attenuates hVIC in vitro calcification through inhibition of apoptosis and osteogenic differentiation via GPR39-dependent ERK1/2 signaling pathway. Zinc transporter ZIP13 and ZIP14 are important regulators of hVIC in vitro calcification and osteogenic differentiation. Zinc supplementation is a potential therapeutic strategy for calcific aortic valve disease.  
Ultrasound-Guided Percutaneous Balloon Aortic Valvuloplasty for Aortic Stenosis.  ;"Percutaneous balloon aortic valvuloplasty (PBAV), which is used to treat symptomatic aortic stenosis, requires ionizing radiation and contrast agent for imaging guidance. The aim of the study is to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of ultrasound-guided PBAV in patients with aortic stenosis. This case series included 30 patients (14 males; mean age, 61.5 ± 4.5 years) with moderate/severe aortic stenosis treated with ultrasound-guided PBAV at the Ultrasound Department, Fuwai Hospital, Beijing, China, between January 2016 and July 2019. Cardiac function (New York Heart Association grade) was assessed before PBAV and 1 month after the procedure. Aortic peak jet velocity, aortic valve orifice area (AVA), mean transvalvular pressure gradient (MTPG), left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVDD), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and left ventricular end-systolic diameter (LVESD) were determined before and immediately after PBAV using Doppler echocardiography. Preprocedural cardiac function was grade I in 3 cases, grade II in 9 cases, grade III in 10 cases, and grade IV in 8 cases. Postprocedural cardiac function was grade I in 22 cases, grade II in 4 cases, and grade III in 4 cases, suggesting that cardiac function was improved by PBAV. Ultrasound-guided PBAV resulted in significant improvements (P < 0.05) in aortic peak jet velocity (3.68 ± 0.811 m/s vs. 4.79 ± 0.63 m/s), MTPG (33.77 ± 13.85 mmHg vs. 54.54 ± 13.81 mmHg), AVA (1.96 ± 0.25 cm2 vs. 0.98 ± 0.12 cm2), LVEDD (51.90 ± 3.21 mm vs. 65.60 ± 6.81 mm), LVEF (63.46 ± 11.29% vs. 56.31 ± 11.04%), and LVESD (35.50 2.62 mm vs. 45.20 ± 2.42 mm). Ultrasound-guided PBAV is feasible and achieves good short-term effects in patients with aortic stenosis.  "
Transcatheter aortic valve implantation-related futility: prevalence, predictors, and clinical risk model.  ;"Futility denotes failure to achieve the projected outcome. We investigated the prevalence, predictors, and clinical risk model of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI)-related futility. We included 464 consecutive patients undergoing TAVI from 2010 to 2017. Futility was defined as death and/or hospitalization for heart failure (HFH) within 1 year after TAVI. Of 464 patients (mean age: 84.4 years), 69% were females (EuroSCOREII: 6.3%; Society of Thoracic Surgeons [STS] score: 6.9%). Forty-six patients (9.9%) experienced TAVI-related futility, and 36 of 46 patients (69.6%) died within 1 year due to cardiac (37.5%) and non-cardiac (62.5%) causes. Previous HFH (hazard ratio [HR], 2.20; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.13-4.35, p = 0.020), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (HR, 3.39; 95% CI: 1.12-8.42, p = 0.033), and moderate/severe mitral or tricuspid regurgitation (HR, 2.98; 95% CI: 1.32-6.27, p = 0.010) were independent predictors of futility. With 1 point assigned to each predictor (total 0 point, futility low-risk; total 1 point, futility intermediate-risk; total 2-3 points, futility high-risk), the futility risk model clearly stratified individual futility risk into three groups (the freedom from futility at 1 year: 96.2%, 82.1%, and 67.9% each). Our futility risk model presented better discrimination than EuroSCOREII, and STS score (c-statistic: 0.73 vs. 0.68 vs. 0.67). Medical futility was recognized in 9.9% of patients undergoing TAVI. Previous HFH, COPD, and concomitant atrioventricular regurgitation were associated with futility. The risk model derived from three predictors showed good performance in predicting futility risk.  "
Geriatric or cardiac rehabilitation? Predictors of treatment pathways in advanced age patients after transcatheter aortic valve implantation.  ;BACKGROUND: Aim of the study was to find predictors of allocating patients after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) to geriatric (GR) or cardiac rehabilitation (CR) and describe this new patient group based on a differentiated characterization. METHODS: From 10/2013 to 07/2015, 344 patients with an elective TAVI were consecutively enrolled in this prospective multicentric cohort study. Before intervention, sociodemographic parameters, echocardiographic data, comorbidities, 6-min walk distance (6MWD), quality of life and frailty (score indexing activities of daily living [ADL], cognition, nutrition and mobility) were documented. Out of these, predictors for assignment to CR or GR after TAVI were identified using a multivariable regression model. RESULTS: After TAVI, 249 patients (80.7 ± 5.1 years, 59.0% female) underwent CR (n = 198) or GR (n = 51). GR patients were older, less physically active and more often had a level of care, peripheral artery disease as well as a lower left ventricular ejection fraction. The groups also varied in 6MWD. Furthermore, individual components of frailty revealed prognostic impact: higher values in instrumental ADL reduced the probability for referral to GR (OR:0.49, p <  0.001), while an impaired mobility was positively associated with referral to GR (OR:3.97, p = 0.046). Clinical parameters like stroke (OR:0.19 of GR, p = 0.038) and the EuroSCORE (OR:1.04 of GR, p = 0.026) were also predictive. CONCLUSION: Advanced age patients after TAVI referred to CR or GR differ in several parameters and seem to be different patient groups with specific needs, e.g. regarding activities of daily living and mobility. Thus, our data prove the eligibility of both CR and GR settings.  
Butterfly technique in mitral valve repair.  ;Degenerative mitral regurgitation due to posterior leaflet prolapse is often associated with tissue redundancy in the leaflet height and free margin of the prolapsing segment. The butterfly technique has been introduced for focal resection to precisely control the leaflet height without annular plication. This technique is indicated for a high prolapsing leaflet, greater than 20 mm. With intraoperative measurement of leaflet heights and ink dot marking as a depth indicator, the butterfly technique can be safely performed in most high posterior leaflet prolapse cases, without increasing the risk of systolic anterior motion.  
Piezo1 is required for outflow tract and aortic valve development.  ;AIMS: During embryogenesis, the onset of circulatory blood flow generates a variety of hemodynamic forces which reciprocally induce changes in cardiovascular development and performance. It has been known for some time that these forces can be detected by as yet unknown mechanosensory systems which in turn promote cardiogenic events such as outflow tract and aortic valve development. PIEZO1 is a mechanosensitive ion channel present in endothelial cells where it serves to detect hemodynamic forces making it an ideal candidate to play a role during cardiac development. We sought to determine whether PIEZO1 is required for outflow tract and aortic valve development. METHODS AND RESULTS: By analysing heart development in zebrafish we have determined that piezo1 is expressed in the developing outflow tract where it serves to detect hemodynamic forces. Consequently, disrupting Piezo1 signalling leads to defective outflow tract and aortic valve development and indicates this gene may be involved in the etiology of congenital heart diseases. Based on these findings, we analysed genomic data generated from patients who suffer from left ventricular outflow tract obstructions (LVOTO) and identified 3 probands who each harboured potentially pathogenic variants in PIEZO1. Subsequent in vitro and in vivo assays indicates that these variants behave as dominant negatives leading to an inhibition of normal PIEZO1 mechanosensory activity. Expressing these dominant negative PIEZO1 variants in zebrafish endothelium leads to defective aortic valve development. CONCLUSION: These data indicate that the mechanosensitive ion channel piezo1 is required for outflow tract and aortic valve development.  
Primary Aortic Root Replacement Outcomes and Risk Factors in Pediatric Patients.  ;"BACKGROUND: The study sought to identify the optimal aortic root replacement (ARR) strategy for pediatric patients, and a single-center experience was analyzed. METHODS: Retrospective review of patients undergoing ARR from 1995 to 2018 was performed. Patients were stratified by surgical strategy (pulmonary autograft [Ross procedure], aortic homograft, mechanical valve conduit [Bentall procedure], or porcine xenograft [Freestyle bioprosthesis]) and aortic annulus size. RESULTS: ARR was performed in 206 patients with a median follow-up of 5.0 (interquartile range, 1.4-11.4) years. Root replacements included Ross procedure (n = 98), homograft (n = 83), Bentall procedure (n = 18), and Freestyle bioprosthesis (n = 7). Overall survival was 92%, and freedom from reoperation or death was 81%. Reoperation-free survival was superior in the Ross group when compared with other groups. Because surgical options differ based on the size of the aortic annulus, the analysis was arbitrarily stratified. When the aortic annulus diameter was greater than 19 mm (n = 74), procedures included Ross procedure (n = 23), homograft (n = 29), Bentall procedure (n = 17), and Freestyle bioprosthesis (n = 5). Reoperation-free survival at median follow-up (5 years) was 86%, 58%, 100%, and 100%, respectively. The Bentall procedure offered the longest freedom from reoperation. In the subset with aortic annulus diameter less than 19 mm and a pulmonary valve suitable for a Ross procedure, patients underwent the Ross procedure (n = 75) or homograft ARR (n = 36). At median follow-up (3.8 years), reoperation-free survival was longer after the Ross procedure than after homograft ARR (88% vs 46%; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with a large aortic annulus, a Bentall ARR offers the longest reoperation-free survival. For patients with small aortic roots, a Ross procedure provides better a reoperation-free survival than does homograft ARR.  "
Triage considerations for patients referred for structural heart disease intervention during the COVID-19 pandemic: An ACC/SCAI position statement.  ;The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has strained health care resources around the world, causing many institutions to curtail or stop elective procedures. This has resulted in an inability to care for patients with valvular and structural heart disease in a timely fashion, potentially placing these patients at increased risk for adverse cardiovascular complications, including CHF and death. The effective triage of these patients has become challenging in the current environment, as clinicians have had to weigh the risk of bringing susceptible patients into the hospital environment during the COVID-19 pandemic against the risk of delaying a needed procedure. In this document, the authors suggest guidelines for how to triage patients in need of structural heart disease interventions and provide a framework for how to decide when it may be appropriate to proceed with intervention despite the ongoing pandemic. In particular, the authors address the triage of patients in need of transcatheter aortic valve replacement and percutaneous mitral valve repair. The authors also address procedural issues and considerations for the function of structural heart disease teams during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Del Nido cardioplegia in coronary surgery: a propensity-matched analysis.  ;"OBJECTIVES: Del Nido cardioplegia (DNC) has been shown to be safe in adults with normal coronary arteries who are undergoing valve surgery. This study compared the effects of DNC versus traditional blood-based cardioplegia on postoperative complications in patients who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on 863 patients who underwent CABG with DNC (n = 420) or control cardioplegia (CC) (n = 443) between 2014 and 2017. The full cohort of DNC and CC recipients, as well as propensity score-matched pairs, was compared regarding preoperative risk variables and outcomes. RESULTS: The DNC and CC groups showed no significant differences in mean cardiopulmonary bypass time (53.09 vs 52.10 min, P = 0.206) or aortic cross-clamp time (32.82 vs 33.28 min, P = 0.967). The groups also showed no difference in operative mortality (2.1% vs 2.5%, P = 0.734); however, DNC use resulted in lower rates of overall infections (1.7% vs 4.3%, P = 0.024), total sternal infections (0.9% vs 3.2%, P = 0.023), postoperative atrial fibrillation (23.8% vs 30.7%, P = 0.023) and postoperative ventricular tachycardia (0.5% vs 3.4%, P = 0.002). A propensity-matching analysis (n = 335 pairs) showed similar statistically significant decreases with DNC. CONCLUSIONS: In this large cohort of CABG patients, DNC was shown as a safe alternative to CC and was associated with lower postoperative dysrhythmia and infection rates. These findings show that DNC is safe and effective in patients whose operative interventions may require only single-dosing cardioplegia; its use in longer cases should be further explored given its low complication rate.

The membranous septum revisited: A glimpse of our anatomical past.  ;"The so-called membranous septum is the fibrous component of the septal structures within the heart. It is relatively subtle in its appearance, but of considerable significance to the understanding of cardiac function and cardiac disease, both congenital and acquired. Surprisingly, its existence was seemingly unknown until the early decades of the 19th century. At this time, those writing in the English language described it as the ""undefended space,"" recognizing its importance in the setting of its aneurysmal dilation, and as the site of septal defects. By the initial decade of the 20th century, it had come to be recognized as the landmark to the site of atrioventricular bundle. Over the first decade of the 21st century, its clinical significance has been emphasized in the context of transcutaneous replacement of the aortic valve. In this review, we describe our own recent investigations of this fibrous part of the septal structures. At the same time, we provide a glimpse of our anatomic past, explaining how its initial description relied on the observations of young physicians taking their first steps in the investigation of cardiac anatomy.

Structural Valve Deterioration after Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation Using J-Valve: A Long-Term Follow-Up.  ;"PURPOSE: Our study aimed to investigate the structural valve deterioration (SVD) after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) using J-Valve. METHODS: In all, 14 patients with aortic stenosis (AS) and 4 patients with pure aortic regurgitation (PAR) were available in the study. Four-year follow-up was performed in all patients, and the clinical data and echocardiographic findings were recorded and analyzed. RESULTS: All patients survived at the 4-year follow-up. There was no evidence of morphological SVD or prosthetic valve thrombosis in enrolled patients. None of the hemodynamic SVD occurred in patients with PAR. Mean gradients decreased from 61.93 ± 15.42 mm Hg (pre-TAVI) to 19.64 ± 9.16 mm Hg (discharge) in patients with AS (p <0.001); subsequently, a slight increase was observed in the mean trans-aortic gradient throughout follow-up (p = 0.967). Overall, in patients with AS, six individuals suffered moderate (3/14, 21.4%) or severe (3/14, 21.4%) hemodynamic SVD at 4-year follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The limited number of cases provides a preliminary indication of the long-term efficacy of TAVI using J-Valve in patients with PAR. In patients with AS, although the higher rate of SVD was observed, the overall transcatheter heart valve (THV) hemodynamics remained stable over time after prosthetic valve implantation and the long-term durability of J-Valve was convincing.

Multiple Valve Implantation Through a Minimally Invasive Approach: Comparison of Standard Median Sternotomy and Right Anterior Thoracotomy.  ;BACKGROUND: Following developments in the area of minimally invasive surgery and good, recently published surgical results, the areas in which minimally invasive surgery can be used are beginning to expand. This study aimed to describe experience and show the feasibility and safety of minimally invasive multiple valve implantation with right anterior minithoracotomy (RAT) and compare the outcomes with cases that underwent multiple valve surgery via a standard median sternotomy. METHODS: The study cohort comprised 52 patients with combined valvular disease who underwent aortic valve replacement and mitral valve replacement or repair, and/or tricuspid valve ring annuloplasty through median sternotomy (control group n=32) or minimally invasive surgery through a RAT (study group n=20) between January 2012 and December 2018 at the current centre. Preoperative evaluation included coronary catheterisation and multisliced computerised tomography in all patients. Postoperative clinical outcomes and haemodynamic performance of heart valves were reviewed. RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 72.6±7.1 years, and 50% were male. Seventeen (17) patients (32.6%) were in New York Heart Association functional class III or IV. Three (3) patients (7.6%) had third-degree atrioventricular block requiring permanent pacemaker implantation. Mean follow-up was 21±3.9 months (maximum 26 months). No major paravalvular leakage occurred, and there was no postoperative valve migration in either group. Non-valve-related deaths occurred in five patients during follow-up. CONCLUSION: This study showed that minimally invasive multiple valve implantation is a technically feasible and safe procedure with acceptable surgical outcomes and similar postoperative quality when compared with median sternotomy.  
A novel cross-species model of Barlow's disease to biomechanically analyze repair techniques in an ex vivo left heart simulator.  ;OBJECTIVE: Barlow's disease remains challenging to repair, given the complex valvular morphology and lack of quantitative data to compare techniques. Although there have been recent strides in ex vivo evaluation of cardiac mechanics, to our knowledge, there is no disease model that accurately simulates the morphology and pathophysiology of Barlow's disease. The purpose of this study was to design such a model. METHODS: To simulate Barlow's disease, a cross-species ex vivo model was developed. Bovine mitral valves (n = 4) were sewn into a porcine annulus mount to create excess leaflet tissue and elongated chordae. A heart simulator generated physiologic conditions while hemodynamic data, high-speed videography, and chordal force measurements were collected. The regurgitant valves were repaired using nonresectional repair techniques such as neochord placement. RESULTS: The model successfully imitated the complexities of Barlow's disease, including redundant, billowing bileaflet tissues with notable regurgitation. After repair, hemodynamic data confirmed reduction of mitral leakage volume (25.9 ± 2.9 vs 2.1 ± 1.8 mL, P < .001) and strain gauge analysis revealed lower primary chordae forces (0.51 ± 0.17 vs 0.10 ± 0.05 N, P < .001). In addition, the maximum rate of change of force was significantly lower postrepair for both primary (30.80 ± 11.38 vs 8.59 ± 4.83 N/s, P < .001) and secondary chordae (33.52 ± 10.59 vs 19.07 ± 7.00 N/s, P = .006). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides insight into the biomechanics of Barlow's disease, including sharply fluctuating force profiles experienced by elongated chordae prerepair, as well as restoration of primary chordae forces postrepair. Our disease model facilitates further in-depth analyses to optimize the repair of Barlow's disease.

Contemporary review of percutaneous therapy for tricuspid valve regurgitation.  ;Introduction: Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is a poor prognostic factor regardless of right ventricular function. However, a majority of patients are managed medically rather than undergoing isolated tricuspid valve surgery due to high in-hospital mortality. Percutaneous therapy in the form of transcatheter tricuspid valve repair or replacement is an attractive option for this high risk multimorbid cohort.Areas covered: A literature search was performed for tricuspid valve repair or replacement using MEDLINE, Current Contents Connect, Google Scholar, EMBASE, Cochrane library, PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science (Till 10/19). This review outlines the anatomical challenges specific to the tricuspid valve, provides an insight into patient selection for percutaneous treatment, and summarizes the current evidence for the available devices.Expert opinion: With the recent understanding that percutaneous repair of TR is feasible and provides better patient outcomes, we must more closely evaluate our patients with tricuspid regurgitation and consider treatment. MitraClip in the tricuspid position (TriClip) is the most widely used TV repair device, and several prospective trials are currently investigating various devices in this arena that hopefully will hopefully provide greater insight into patient selection and anatomically specific device choice.  
Slit Orifice Aortic Cusp Extension Technique for Small Bicuspid Valves.  ;We describe a modification to the aortic cusp extension technique that eliminates aortic regurgitation in pediatric small bicuspid valves. This simple and reproducible cusp extension technique secures coaptation and commissure suspension of the reconstructed aortic valve and may act as a bridge option for forthcoming reoperations.  
Meta-analysis Comparing Valve-In-Valve Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation With Self-Expanding Versus Balloon-Expandable Valves.  ;Valve-in-valve (ViV) transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is an alternative to redo-surgery in patients with failed surgical bioprostheses. It remains unclear whether outcomes vary when using either self-expanding (SE) or balloon-expandable (BE) valves. The aim of this study was to compare outcomes between SE and BE transcatheter heart valves when used for ViV TAVI. A systematic review of PubMed, MEDLINE, and EMBASE was performed identifying studies reporting outcomes following ViV TAVI. Event rates were pooled for meta-analysis using a random-effects model. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality at 12 months. Secondary outcomes included 30-day and 3-year mortality in addition to standard safety outcomes after the procedure as per the Valve Academic Research Consortium criteria. Nineteen studies reporting outcomes for 1,772 patients were included: 924 in the SE group and 848 patients in the BE group. There was no significant difference in all-cause mortality at 12 months (SE 10.3% vs BE 12.6%, p = 0.165, I2 = 0%), or 3 years (SE 21.2% vs BE 31.2%, p = 0.407, I2 = 63.79). SE valves had lower transvalvular gradients after procedure and acute kidney injury, but higher rates of pacemaker insertion, moderate or severe paravalvular regurgitation and need for ≥2 valves (all p < 0.05). There were no differences in stroke, coronary obstruction, bleeding, or vascular complications. Despite significant differences in key procedural outcomes between SE and BE valves when used for ViV TAVI, we found no difference in 12-month mortality. Tailored device selection may further reduce the risk of adverse procedural outcomes, particularly over the longer term.  
Non-coding RNAs: Regulators of valvular calcification.  ;There is currently a growing global burden of valvular heart diseases due to aging populations and changing lifestyles. Valvular heart diseases mainly include the malfunctioning of aortic and mitral valves and are characterized by extensive tissue remodeling, which includes calcification, endothelial dysfunction, and endothelial-mesenchymal transition. These valvular remodeling processes are known to be regulated by protein-coding genes as well as non-coding genes. Here, we have summarized studies highlighting the non-coding RNA mediated regulation of valvular tissue remodeling and their potential therapeutic benefits. Additionally, studies investigating the diagnostic capability of circulating non-coding RNA molecules in valvular diseases are also summarized. Overall, of the various candidates, several studies have highlighted miR-214 and miR-204 as central regulators of valvular calcification.  
Impact of Aortic Valve Replacement for Severe Aortic Stenosis on Perioperative Outcomes Following Major Noncardiac Surgery.  ;"OBJECTIVE: To compare the incidence of major adverse cardiac events and death among severe aortic stenosis patients with and without aortic valve replacement (AVR) before noncardiac surgery. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 491 severe aortic stenosis patients undergoing non-emergency/non-urgent elevated-risk noncardiac surgery between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2013, including 203 patients (mean age, 74±10 years, 63.5% men) with previous AVR and 288 patients (mean age, 77±12 years, 55.6% men) without prior AVR. RESULTS: The incidence of major adverse cardiac events was significantly lower in the AVR group (5.4% vs 20.5%; P<.001), primarily because of the lower incidence of new or worsening heart failure (2.5% vs 17.7%; P<.001), compared with the non-AVR group. No significant differences were observed between the groups with and without AVR in the incidence of death (2.5% vs 3.5%; P=.56), myocardial infarction (0.5% vs 1.4%; P=.48), ventricular arrhythmia (0.0% vs 0.7%; P=.51), or stroke (0.0% vs 0.7%; P=.51) at 30-days. At a median follow-up of 4.2 (interquartile range,1.3-7.5) years, overall mortality was significantly worse in patients without versus with AVR (5-year rate: 57.0% vs 32.7%; P<.001). Symptomatic patients without AVR (n=35) had the worst outcomes overall, including increased 30-day and overall mortality rates, compared with the AVR-group and asymptomatic non-AVR patients. CONCLUSION: In patients with severe aortic stenosis, AVR before noncardiac surgery was associated with decreased incidence of heart failure after noncardiac surgery and improved overall survival without differences in 30-day survival, myocardial infarction, ventricular arrhythmia, or stroke. Preoperative AVR should be considered in symptomatic patients for whom the benefit of AVR is greatest.  "

Impact of left atrial diameter on outcome in patients undergoing edge-to-edge mitral valve repair: results from the German TRAnscatheter Mitral valve Interventions (TRAMI) registry.  ;"BACKGROUND: Left atrial (LA) dimension is a marker of disease severity and outcome in primary and secondary mitral regurgitation. In transcatheter mitral valve repair, LA enlargement might additionally impact on device handling and technical success through an altered anatomy and atrial annular dilatation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Data from the multicentre German TRAnscatheter Mitral valve Interventions registry (TRAMI) were used to analyse the association of baseline LA diameter by tertiles with efficacy, safety and long-term clinical outcome in patients undergoing edge-to-edge repair with MitraClip. In 520 of 843 patients prospectively enrolled in TRAMI, baseline LA diameter were reported [median (interquartile range) LA diameter in tertiles: 44 (40-46) mm, 51 (48-53) mm and 60 (55-66) mm]. Larger LA diameters were significantly associated with secondary aetiology of mitral regurgitation, lower ejection fraction, larger left ventricle, male sex and atrial fibrillation (all P < 0.05). Technical success was not different across tertiles (96%, 95.4% and 98.4%, respectively; P = 0.43) as were major in-hospital cardiovascular and cerebral adverse events (mortality, myocardial infarction or stroke: 1.8%, 1.2% and 4.4%, respectively; P = 0.11 across tertiles). However, 4-year mortality significantly increased with larger LA diameter (32.9%, 46.4% and 51.7%, respectively; P < 0.01), as did hospitalization in survivors (60%, 67.6% and 78.9%, respectively; P < 0.05). The association between LA diameter and outcome remained significant after multivariable adjustment including baseline left ventricular end-diastolic diameter. CONCLUSION: Left atrial enlargement is a strong and independent predictor of adverse long-term outcome after transcatheter mitral valve repair. Further study is warranted to examine whether timely intervention may have the potential to modify outcome.  "
[Circular Sympathetic Pulmonary Artery Denervation in Cardiac Surgery Patients With Mitral Valve Defect, Atrial Fibrillation and High Pulmonary Hypertension].  ;"Objective Investigate the influence of the sympathetic denervation of the pulmonary trunk and the orifices of the pulmonary arteries on the degree of pulmonary hypertension (PH) and outcomes of the surgical treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients with mitral valve defects, complicated AF, and high PH.Material and methods We analyzed the surgical treatment of 140 patients with mitral valve defect, concomitant AF, and high PH - pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) gradient more than 40 mm Hg. The group of interest included 51 patients (46 patients with severe mitral stenosis and five patients with grade 4 mitral valve regurgitation). All patients underwent mitral valve correction (47 valve replacement surgeries and 4 valve-sparing interventions), biatrial Maze IV procedure, and additionally, denervation of the pulmonary trunk and the orifices of the pulmonary arteries. The control group included 89 patients diagnosed with mitral valve defect, AF, and PH with PASP &gt; 40 mm Hg. However, unlike in patients of interest, denervation of the pulmonary arteries was not performed.Results Circular radiofrequency denervation of the pulmonary trunk and the orifices of the pulmonary arteries using a clamp-destructor is an effective and safe method, significantly reduces secondary PH (p=0.018), promotes reverse remodeling of the heart chambers, left atrium in particular (p=0.01), and improves outcomes of the Maze IV procedure (p=0.022) by restoring sinus rhythm in patients with mitral valve defects, complicated AF, and high PH.Conclusion This technique must be studied further involving a more significant number of patients, analyzing long-term results, and using this technique in patients with non-valvular causes of secondary PH.

Permanent Conduction System Pacing for Congenitally Corrected Transposition of the Great Arteries.  ;"BACKGROUND: Congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries (CCTGA) is associated with spontaneous AV block and pacing-induced cardiomyopathy. His bundle pacing (HBP) is a potential alternative to conventional CRT. OBJECTIVES: To determine the outcomes of HBP for CCTGA. METHODS: Retrospective data were collected from 10 international centers. RESULTS: HBP or left bundle branch pacing (LBBP) was attempted for 15 CCTGA patients (median 23 yrs, 87% male). Prior surgery had been performed in 5 and chronic ventricular pacing in 6. Conduction system pacing (HBP=11, LBBP=2; non-selective in 10, selective in 3) was acutely successful in 13 (86%) without complication. In 9 cases, electro-anatomical mapping was available and identified the distal His bundle and proximal LBBs within the morphologic LV below the pulmonary valve separate from the mitral annulus. The median implant HV interval was 42 ms (IQR 35 - 48), R wave 6 mV (IQR 5 - 18) and threshold 0.5V (IQR 0.5 - 1.2) at median 0.5 ms. The QRSd was unchanged as compared to junctional escape rhythm (124 vs 110 ms, p=0.17) and decreased significantly compared to baseline ventricular pacing (112 vs 164 ms, p<0.01). At a median of 8 months, all patients were alive without significant change in pacing threshold or lead dysfunction. NYHA class improved in 5 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Permanent conduction system pacing is feasible in CCTGA by either HBP or proximal LBBP. Narrow paced QRS and stable lead thresholds were observed at intermediate follow-up. Unique anatomical characteristics may favor this approach over conventional CRT.  "
Permanent conduction system pacing for congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries: A Pediatric and Congenital Electrophysiology Society (PACES)/International Society for Adult Congenital Heart Disease (ISACHD) Collaborative Study.  ;"BACKGROUND: Congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries (CCTGA) is associated with spontaneous atrioventricular block and pacing-induced cardiomyopathy.

Tricuspid regurgitation velocity and other biomarkers of mortality in children, adolescents and young adults with sickle cell disease in the United States: The PUSH study.  ;In the US, mortality in sickle cell disease (SCD) increases after age 18-20 years. Biomarkers of mortality risk can identify patients who need intensive follow-up and early or novel interventions. We prospectively enrolled 510 SCD patients aged 3-20 years into an observational study in 2006-2010 and followed 497 patients for a median of 88 months (range 1-105). We hypothesized that elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure as reflected in tricuspid regurgitation velocity (TRV) would be associated with mortality. Estimated survival to 18 years was 99% and to 25 years, 94%. Causes of death were known in seven of 10 patients: stroke in four (hemorrhagic two, infarctive one, unspecified one), multiorgan failure one, parvovirus B19 infection one, sudden death one. Baseline TRV ≥2.7 m/second (>2 SD above the mean in age-matched and gender-matched non-SCD controls) was observed in 20.0% of patients who died vs 4.6% of those who survived (P = .012 by the log rank test for equality of survival). The baseline variable most strongly associated with an elevated TRV was a high hemolytic rate. Additional biomarkers associated with mortality were ferritin ≥2000 μg/L (observed in 60% of patients who died vs 7.8% of survivors, P < .001), forced expiratory volume in 1 minute to forced vital capacity ratio (FEV1/FVC) <0.80 (71.4% of patients who died vs 18.8% of survivors, P < .001), and neutrophil count ≥10x109 /L (30.0% of patients who died vs 7.9% of survivors, P = .018). In SCD children, adolescents and young adults, steady-state elevations of TRV, ferritin and neutrophils and a low FEV1/FVC ratio may be biomarkers associated with increased risk of death.  
Higher preoperative left atrial volume index predicts lack of mitral regurgitation improvement after transcatheter aortic valve replacement.  ;BACKGROUND: Moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation is present in 20-35% of patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and the current literature lacks simple echocardiographic parameters, which can predict post-TAVR changes in mitral regurgitation. The aim of this study is to investigate the echocardiographic predictors of improvement or worsening of mitral regurgitation in patients undergoing TAVR with moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation. METHODS: This retrospective study included 113 patients who underwent TAVR with preoperative mitral regurgitation grade at least 2. Patients with concomitant coronary artery disease requiring treatment were excluded. Mitral regurgitation was related to the annular dilatation or tethering mechanism in all patients. Preoperative and postoperative echocardiographies were compared in terms of mitral regurgitation and other commonly measured parameters. RESULTS: After TAVR, a reduction in mitral regurgitation was observed in 62.8% of cases. On the basis of the difference between postoperative and preoperative echocardiograms, 71 patients had improved mitral regurgitation, whereas 42 patients had stable or worsened mitral regurgitation. After analyzing preoperative echocardiographic parameters with regard to this group difference, left atrial volume index (LAVI) was the only variable that was different between groups (33.4 ± 4.8 ml/m in improved mitral regurgitation vs. 39.8 ± 3.0 ml/m in not improved mitral regurgitation, P < 0.001). In a multivariable logistic regression model, a LAVI increase was associated with lack of an acute reduction in mitral regurgitation (odds ratio = 1.41, P < 0.001) after adjustment for age and preoperative serum creatinine. CONCLUSION: Higher preoperative LAVI is a determinant predictor of lack of an acute reduction in mitral regurgitation after TAVR, and LAVI could be used as a stratifying tool to tailor the treatment strategy and the timing of the procedures. However, validation of these results and long-term outcomes are warranted to support those conclusions.  
Q-fever prosthetic valve endocarditis in a patient with SLE and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome.  ;Q fever prosthetic valve endocarditis in association with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) has not been previously reported. Here, we report a 22-year-old Saudi female diagnosed with SLE and APS. She had mitral valve replacement with bio-prosthesis five years earlier for Libman-Sack endocarditis. She presented with two months' history of fever, cough, palpitations, and progressive shortness of breath. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed a degenerative mitral valve prosthesis with a large mass causing severe obstruction. Open heart surgery revealed multiple masses on the mitral valve. PCR from the resected tissues was positive for Coxiella burnetii DNA. Q fever serology showed phase two IgG 1:2048, phase one IgG 1:512, and IgM 1:1024. The valve was replaced with a bio-prosthesis. She was well at 12 months of follow-up.  
Degenerative Mitral Stenosis Versus Rheumatic Mitral Stenosis.  ;Mitral stenosis is classically caused by rheumatic disease (RMS). However, degenerative mitral stenosis (DMS) is increasingly encountered, particularly in developed countries with aging populations. The aim of this study was to compare clinical and echocardiographic characteristics between the 2 entities. One hundred fifteen patients with DMS were identified from an echocardiographic database in the United States and compared with 510 patients with RMS from Seoul, Korea. All subjects had a mitral valve area (MVA) ≤2.5 cm2 by continuity equation but were otherwise unselected. Patients with DMS were older and had more hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease than those with RMS. Atrial fibrillation was more common in RMS patients. Mean mitral valve gradient was slightly lower in DMS versus RMS (7.63 ± 3.67 vs 8.50 ± 4.23 mm Hg, p = 0.04) but MVA was strikingly higher in the DMS group (1.35 ± 0.41 vs 0.95 ± 0.38 cm2, p <0.0001). This appeared to be due to greater stroke volume in the DMS patients (70.4 ± 19.7 vs 55.7 ± 15.5 ml, p <0.0001). Indexed left atrial volume was greater in RMS (82.1 ± 40.3 vs 57.9 ± 21.4 ml, p <0.0001) while estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure was greater in DMS (49.3 ± 16.5 vs 39.4 ± 13.6 mm Hg, p <0.0001). In conclusion, DMS patients are older and have more comorbidities than RMS patients. DMS presents with greater MVA relative to mean mitral valve gradient than RMS. This appears due to a higher stroke volume in DMS patients.

Transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve replacement without contrast medium using the Medtronic CoreValve system: a single center experience.  ;"BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is challenging due to the high risk of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) and acute kidney injury (AKI). AKI dramatically reduces the clinical benefit of TAVR and is one of the strongest predictors of 30-day mortality as well as long-term adverse outcomes after TAVR. The aim of this study was to evaluate a protocol specifically designed to reduce the incidence of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) in advanced CKD patients screened for and undergoing TAVR. METHODS: Twelve consecutive patients with severe aortic valve stenosis suffering from at least stage 4 CKD underwent both screening with pre-procedural computed tomography scan (CT scan) and bioprosthetic valve implantation without contrast medium. All the TAVR procedures were performed using the CoreValve Evolut R/PRO transcatheter aortic valve (Medtronic Inc, Minneapolis, MN, USA). The annulus and the optimal implantation projection were identified on the non-contrast medium CT scans with the aid of calcifications as a reference. The implant projection was confirmed immediately before the valve implantation by placing two pigtail catheters alternately inside each sinus of Valsalva (SOV). RESULTS: We enrolled 12 patients: mean age 83.42 4.50 years, number of male 5 (41.7%), mean STS 10.33±6.16, mean EuroScore II 13.75±9.07, mean serum creatinine 2.01±0.63 mg/dL, mean eGFR 23.00±5.69 mL/min/1.7m2. All TAVR procedures were successful, leading to a drop in transaortic mean gradient (mean gradient 33.5±14.09 mmHg; postoperative mean gradient 6.08±mmHg). No patient had more than a mild paravalvular leak. Only two patients underwent permanent pacemaker implantation due to advanced atrioventricular block (AV block). Mean change in eGFR 48 hours after the procedure was 1.3 mL/min. None of the patients developed AKI, according to Valve Academic Research Consortium-2 (VARC-2) definition. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with advanced CKD, a strategy of ""zero contrast"" TAVR, preceded by accurate CT scan analysis and procedural planning, appears to be safe and feasible permitting to preserve renal function. The avoidance of contrast medium during preprocedural analysis and TAVR implantation could reduce the incidence of AKI and consequently could improve outcomes in this complex patient cohort.  "
Mitral Valve Repair in Children Below Age 10 Years: Trouble or Success?  ;BACKGROUND: Mitral valve (MV) repair in children is challenging because of the broad spectrum of lesions and anticipated patient growth. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the outcome of MV repair in children below 10 years of age. METHODS: We reviewed all MV repair procedures performed in children below 10 years of age. Endpoints of the study were survival after MV repair and cumulative incidence of reoperation. RESULTS: MV repair was performed in 40 patients with congenital MV disease (MVD) and in 10 patients with acquired MVD. Median age at time of repair for congenital MVD was 1.2 years (range, 14 days to 9.8 years) and for acquired MVD 1.9 years (range, 10 days to 9.9 years). Indication for MV repair was mitral regurgitation in 31 congenital MVD patients (77.5%) and in all acquired MVD patients. In patients with congenital MVD operative mortality was 5% and late mortality was 10%. No deaths occurred in patients with acquired MVD. Patients with congenital mitral regurgitation showed a better, yet not significant, 6-year survival than patients with congenital mitral stenosis (85.3% ± 8.2% vs 60% ± 18.2%, P = .1). In patients with congenital MVD cumulative incidence of reoperation at 6 years was 38.6% ± 8.3%. CONCLUSIONS: In children below 10 years of age, MV repair is an effective treatment option for MVD. However it often just delays the time to valve replacement.  
[Transcatheter valve-in-valve implantation of the 'MedLab-KT' prosthesis].  ;Valve-in-valve repeat prosthetic reconstruction is a less invasive alternative to 'open' redo operation for degenerative dysfunction of an aortic bioprosthesis. At the beginning of the history of using this method it was resorted to only in cases of high surgical risk, involving virtually inoperable patients. Currently, the world experience numbers in thousands of such interventions, known to be also performed in patients not belonging to a high-risk group. Recent studies have demonstrated a decrease in the perioperative mortality and improved quality of life in the remote period after valve-in-valve transcatheter implantation of an aortic bioprosthesis. High gradients, occlusion of coronary arteries, and thrombosis of the prosthesis's leaflets remain the major problems encountered while using this method. Nevertheless, valve-in-valve prosthetic reconstruction proved to be a reliably safe and efficient procedure of correcting dysfunction of a previously implanted biological prosthesis.  
[Comparative assessment of immediate results of mitral valve repair according to the classical technique with posterior leaflet preservation].  ;We comparatively assessed the results of mitral valve repair according to the classical technique either with complete removal of leaflets or with the preservation of the posterior leaflet and the chordal-papillary apparatus. Depending on the variant of the operation, all patients were divided into two groups. Group One consisted of 23 patients in whom the posterior leaflet with the chordal-papillary apparatus was preserved, and Group Two comprised 23 patients in whom the mitral valve was removed completely. In the immediate postoperative period, Group One patients were found to have a decrease in the left ventricular end-systolic and end-diastolic dimensions and volumes. Similar dynamics was observed in relation to the left-atrial dimension, with a decrease in the pressure gradient across the mitral valve, pulmonary artery systolic pressure, and the degree of systolic shortening of the anterior-posterior size of the left ventricle. Group Two patients also demonstrated positive dynamics in relation to the left ventricular size and volume, the size of the left atrium and the right ventricle. The left-ventricular ejection fraction in the immediate postoperative period decreased averagely from 59.0±9.8% to 56.1±9.4%, accompanied and followed by a decrease in the pressure gradient across the mitral valve and pulmonary artery systolic pressure. The degree of systolic shortening of the anterior-posterior size of the left ventricle remained unchanged postoperatively. A conclusion was drawn that preserving the annulo-papillary continuity after mitral valve repair made it possible to achieve better functional results, normalization of the intracardiac haemodynamics, and improvement of the left-ventricle myocardial contractility. Complete removal of the subvalvular structures resulted in decreased contractility of the left ventricular myocardium.

Sex-related difference in outcomes after aortic root replacement.  ;"PURPOSE: Poorer short-term outcomes have been described for females after cardiovascular surgery. We examined the influence of sex on the outcomes after aortic root replacement (ARR). METHODS: Medical records of 848 patients (females, n = 159/848, 19%) who underwent ARR at our center from 2005 to 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. Sex differences of the following outcomes were analyzed: the primary end point (in-hospital mortality or stro111ke), secondary end point (new requirement for permanent pacemaker), and long-term survival (median follow-up 21.4 months [interquartile range,1.3-60.0]). RESULTS: Females were significantly older (61.3 vs 58.7 [male]) with higher rates of pre-existing cerebrovascular disease (14% [22/159] vs 7% [52/689]) and previous valve intervention (20% [32/159] vs 13% [89/689]) but less myocardial infarction [1%(1/159) vs 7%(48/689)]. The surgical indication was different (aneurysm 75% [120/159] vs 87% [602/689], dissection 13% [21/159] vs 6% [41/689]; P < .01]). Females had larger average aneurysm size after controlling for body size (P ≤ .001). There was no sex difference in in-hospital mortality (3% [5/159] vs 2% [16/689]) or stroke (4% [7/159] vs 4% [29/689]). Multivariable logistic regression indicated that female sex was not an independent predictor of combined in-hospital stroke or death (odds ratio [OR], 0.59; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.28-1.25), confirmed by propensity score analysis. There was no difference in long-term survival (5-year survival, 90.96% vs 93.03%; P = .44). Females had higher incidence of permanent pacemaker requirement [11% (18/159) vs 6% (39/689), P = .03] and female sex was an independent predictor of permanent pacemaker requirement (OR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.085-3.724; P = .03). CONCLUSIONS: While female patients have different baseline characteristics and indication for ARR, they are not exposed to an increased risk of in-hospital mortality or stroke. However, females experience increased incidence of permanent pacemaker requirement.  "
Partial Ross procedure for aortic valve repair in children with bicuspid aortic valve: An original surgical technique.  ;BACKGROUND AND AIMS: There is still no optimal strategy for aortic valve repair in children. To assess the safety and efficacy of an original surgical technique: Partial-Ross procedure. METHODS: Eight pediatric patients with bicuspid aortic valve underwent the Partial-Ross procedure. RESULTS: The patients were doing well at a longest duration of 58-month follow-up visit. There was no case with aortic stenosis and three cases with mild to moderate aortic regurgitation, which had no significant clinical impact. CONCLUSION: Partial-Ross procedure could be used as an alternative for aortic valve repair in children.  
Dramatic resolution of an immediate postoperative distortion of the circumflex artery during mitral valve surgery.  ;"Injury or distortion of the circumflex coronary artery can occur during mitral valve surgery, due to its proximity to the mitral valve annulus. We present the case of a 72-year-old male patient with symptomatic mitral regurgitation, who underwent minimally invasive mitral valve surgery. The initial reparative gesture was complicated by intraoperative infarct due to a distortion of the circumflex artery (CX) caused by the rigidity of the ring used; the mainstay of the treatment was the removal of the previous device implanted in favor of a flexible one with restitutio ad integrum of the CX patency.

Associations between functional tricuspid regurgitation and long-term outcomes for patients with pulmonary hypertension.  ;Functional tricuspid regurgitation (FTR) is associated with prognosis for various heart diseases, but its association with pulmonary hypertension (PH) remains unclear. We studied 111 PH patients. Mid-term follow-up echocardiography was performed 7.1 ± 4.1 months after PH-specific therapy. The severity of FTR was graded as none or trace, mild, moderate, or severe, while more than moderate TR was defined as significant. Moreover, mid-term improvement in FTR after therapy was defined as an improvement in severity of FTR by a grade of 1 or more. Long-term follow-up to determine the primary endpoint of death or hospitalization for heart failure lasted 39 ± 14 months. Mid-term improvement in FTR after PH-specific treatment was observed in 25 patients (23%), and the primary end points occurred in 27 patients (24%) during the long-term follow-up. The Kaplan-Meier curve indicated that the non-FTR group showed more favorable long-term outcomes than the FTR group (log-rank P = 0.008). It further indicated that patients with mid-term improvement in FTR also had more favorable long-term outcomes than those without such improvement (log-rank P = 0.03). When divided into four sub-groups based on combined assessment of baseline FTR and mid-term improvement in FTR, long-term outcomes for patients without mid-term improvement in their baseline FTR were worse than for the other sub-groups (log-rank P = 0.02). Multiple regression analysis showed that a relative change in tricuspid annular diameter at the mid-term follow-up after PH-specific therapy was the only independent determinant parameters for mid-term improvement in FTR. FTR appears to be a valuable factor for predicting long-term outcomes for PH patients, and combined assessment of baseline FTR and mid-term improvement in FTR after PH-specific therapy may have clinical implications for better management of such patients.

[Application of arterial duct stent in ductus-dependent hypoplastic right heart syndrome].  ;Objective: To summarize the experience of arterial duct (AD) stenting in children with ductus-dependent hypoplastic right heart syndrome (HRHS). Methods: Seven children including 4 cases of pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum (PA-IVS) with HRHS and 3 cases of critical pulmonary stenosis (CPS)-IVS with HRHS underwent AD stenting in Qingdao Women and Children's Hospital between January 2012 and January 2019. During the same period, 9 patients of PA-IVS with HRHS received Blalock Taussig (B-T) shunt. Two groups of children on the operation time, hospital stay time, intensive care time and mortality were compared.T test or Mann-Whitney U test was used for comparison between the two groups. Results: There was no significant difference in the age (18 (7-100) vs. 17 (1-142) d, U=31.000, P>0.05) and weight ((3.8±1.1) vs. (3.7±1.3) kg, t=0.272, P>0.05) between the AD stenting group and the B-T group.The operation time ((108±7) vs. (160±49) min, t=-4.304), intensive care time ((3.4±1.0) vs. (6.3±4.5) d, t=-8.692) and total hospitalization time ((10.3±1.0) vs. (26.3±1.0) d, t=-7.822) in the AD stenting group were differed significantly compared with the B-T group (all P<0.05). The transcutaneous oxygen saturation improved significantly (0.723±0.125 vs. 0.926±0.005, t=-6.044, P<0.05) after AD stenting. The diameter of AD stent ranged from 3.5 to 4.0 mm, and the length of AD stent was 16-21 mm. There were no complications such as vascular injury, acute thrombus, catheter spasm and death in the AD stenting group. The mortality of children in the B-T group was 3 in 9 cases. Three cases in the AD stenting group received pulmonary valvulotomy and bilateral Glenn operation at 6, 9 and 9 months after AD stenting, respectively. Conclusions: AD stenting is a feasible, effective, safe and minimally invasive procedure for children with ductus-dependent HRHS. It can even be used as an alternative to B-T shunt.  
Characteristic Histopathological Findings and Cardiac Arrest Rhythm in Isolated Mitral Valve Prolapse and Sudden Cardiac Death.  ;"Background The association between mitral valve prolapse (MVP) and sudden death remains controversial. We aimed to describe histopathological changes in individuals with autopsy-determined isolated MVP (iMVP) and sudden death and document cardiac arrest rhythm. Methods and Results The Australian National Coronial Information System database was used to identify cases of iMVP between 2000 and 2018. Histopathological changes in iMVP and sudden death were compared with 2 control cohorts matched for age, sex, height, and weight (1 group with noncardiac death and 1 group with cardiac death). Data linkage with ambulance services provided cardiac arrest rhythm for iMVP cases. From 77 221 cardiovascular deaths in the National Coronial Information System database, there were 376 cases with MVP. Individual case review yielded 71 cases of iMVP. Mean age was 49±18 years, and 51% were women. Individuals with iMVP had higher cardiac mass (447 g versus 355 g; P<0.001) compared with noncardiac death, but similar cardiac mass (447 g versus 438 g; P=0.64) compared with cardiac death. Individuals with iMVP had larger mitral valve annulus compared with noncardiac death (121 versus 108 mm; P<0.001) and cardiac death (121 versus 110 mm; P=0.002), and more left ventricular fibrosis (79% versus 38%; P<0.001) compared with noncardiac death controls. In those with iMVP and witnessed cardiac arrest, 94% had ventricular fibrillation. Conclusions Individuals with iMVP and sudden death have increased cardiac mass, mitral annulus size, and left ventricular fibrosis compared with a matched cohort, with cardiac arrest caused by ventricular fibrillation. The histopathological changes in iMVP may provide the substrate necessary for development of malignant ventricular arrhythmias.  "
Caseous Mitral Annular Calcification (CMAC) in an octogenarian with Calcific LV Aneurysm.  ;Caseous Mitral Annular Calcification (CMAC) is seen in 0.6% of Mitral annular Calcification (MAC) and carries an increased risk for ischemic stroke. The typical location is Posterior Mitral Annular area and arises as degeneration of MAC. Typical Echocardiographic features along with Cardiac MRI and CT imaging features are diagnostic.  
Incidence and influence of prosthesis-patient mismatch after reoperative aortic valve replacement: a retrospective single-center study.  ;"BACKGROUND: Reoperative aortic valve replacement (AVR) is associated with increased mortality compared with initial surgery, and a smaller valve might be implanted during repeat AVR (re-AVR; AVR after prior AVR). We describe the clinical outcomes and incidence of prosthesis-patient mismatches (PPM) after reoperative AVR. METHODS: Among 113 patients who underwent reoperative AVR between 2007 and 2018, 44 underwent re-AVR and 69 underwent a first replacement of a diseased natural valve after any cardiac surgery except AVR (primary AVR). We then compared early and late outcomes, the impact of re-AVR on the effective orifice areas (EOA), and the incidence and influence of PPM on reoperative AVR. RESULTS: Hospital mortality was 2.7%, and the overall 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates were 95, 91 and 86%, respectively. The reference EOA of the newly implanted valve was smaller than that of the previous valve (1.4 ± 0.3 vs. 1.6 ± 0.3 cm2, p < 0.01). The mean pressure gradient was greater (15.2 ± 6.4 vs. 12.7 ± 6.2 mmHg, p = 0.04) and indexed EOA was smaller (0.92 ± 0.26 vs. 1.06 ± 0.36 cm2/m2, p = 0.04) during re-AVR than primary AVR, whereas the incidence of PPM was similar (38.7% vs. 34.8%, p = 0.87) between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical outcomes of reoperative AVR were acceptable. Although the reference EOA of new implanted valves was smaller than that of previous valves, re-AVR did not increase the incidence of PPM. These findings might serve as a guide for future decisions regarding the surgical approach to treating degenerated prosthetic valves.  "
The Joint Analysis of Multi-Omics Data Revealed the Methylation-Expression Regulations in Atrial Fibrillation.  ;Atrial fibrillation (AF) is one of the most prevalent heart rhythm disorder. The causes of AF include age, male sex, diabetes, hypertension, valve disease, and systolic/diastolic dysfunction. But on molecular level, its mechanisms are largely unknown. In this study, we collected 10 patients with persistent atrial fibrillation, 10 patients with paroxymal atrial fibrillation and 10 healthy individuals and did Methylation EPICBead Chip and RNA sequencing. By analyzing the methylation and gene expression data using machine learning based feature selection method Boruta, we identified the key genes that were strongly associated with AF and found their interconnections. The results suggested that the methylation of KIF15 may regulate the expression of PSMC3, TINAG, and NUDT6. The identified AF associated methylation-expression regulations may help understand the molecular mechanisms of AF from a multi-omics perspective.  
A Computational Model of the Endothelial to Mesenchymal Transition.  ;Endothelial cells (ECs) form the lining of lymph and blood vessels. Changes in tissue requirements or wounds may cause ECs to behave as tip or stalk cells. Alternatively, they may differentiate into mesenchymal cells (MCs). These processes are known as EC activation and endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT), respectively. EndMT, Tip, and Stalk EC behaviors all require SNAI1, SNAI2, and Matrix metallopeptidase (MMP) function. However, only EndMT inhibits the expression of VE-cadherin, PECAM1, and VEGFR2, and also leads to EC detachment. Physiologically, EndMT is involved in heart valve development, while a defective EndMT regulation is involved in the physiopathology of cardiovascular malformations, congenital heart disease, systemic and organ fibrosis, pulmonary arterial hypertension, and atherosclerosis. Therefore, the control of EndMT has many promising potential applications in regenerative medicine. Despite the fact that many molecular components involved in EC activation and EndMT have been characterized, the system-level molecular mechanisms involved in this process have not been elucidated. Toward this end, hereby we present Boolean network model of the molecular involved in the regulation of EC activation and EndMT. The simulated dynamic behavior of our model reaches fixed and cyclic patterns of activation that correspond to the expected EC and MC cell types and behaviors, recovering most of the specific effects of simple gain and loss-of-function mutations as well as the conditions associated with the progression of several diseases. Therefore, our model constitutes a theoretical framework that can be used to generate hypotheses and guide experimental inquiry to comprehend the regulatory mechanisms behind EndMT. Our main findings include that both the extracellular microevironment and the pattern of molecular activity within the cell regulate EndMT. EndMT requires a lack of VEGFA and sufficient oxygen in the extracellular microenvironment as well as no FLI1 and GATA2 activity within the cell. Additionally Tip cells cannot undergo EndMT directly. Furthermore, the specific conditions that are sufficient to trigger EndMT depend on the specific pattern of molecular activation within the cell.  
Significance of Pulmonary Vascular Resistance and Diastolic Pressure Gradient on the New Definition of Combined Post-Capillary Pulmonary Hypertension.  ;"Pulmonary hypertension (PH) caused by left-sided heart disease (LHD-PH) is classified into 2 types: isolated post-capillary PH (Ipc-PH) and combined pre- and post-capillary PH (Cpc-PH). However, the impact of pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) or diastolic pressure gradient (DPG) on the prognosis of LHD-PH has varied among previous studies. Thus, we verified the significance of PVR or DPG on the prognosis of LHD-PH in our series.We analyzed 243 consecutive LHD-PH patients. The patients were divided into 3 groups: Group A, patients with PVR ≤ 3 Wood unit (WU) and DPG < 7 mmHg; Group B, patients with either PVR > 3 WU or DPG ≥ 7 mmHg; and Group C, patients with PVR > 3 WU and DPG ≥ 7 mmHg.The Kaplan-Meier curve demonstrated that Group B had lower cardiac death-free survival compared with Group A, whereas no significant differences were observed when compared with Group C. In the Cox hazard model, DPG was not associated with cardiac death in the LHD-PH patients. However, only in the ischemic heart disease group, patients with DPG ≥ 7 mmHg had worse prognosis compared with those with normal DPG.The cardiac death-free rate of patients with either increased PVR or DPG was close to that of patients with both increased PVR and DPG. It seems reasonable to define Cpc-PH only by PVR in the new criteria. However, the significance of DPG in LHD-PH might be dependent on the underlying cause of LHD-PH.  "
Prevalence and Cause of Early Fontan Complications: Does the Lymphatic Circulation Play a Role?  ;Background Recent studies suggest that lymphatic congestion plays a role in development of late Fontan complications, such as protein-losing enteropathy. However, the role of the lymphatic circulation in early post-Fontan outcomes is not well defined. Methods and Results This was a retrospective, single-center study of patients undergoing first-time Fontan completion from 2012 to 2017. The primary outcome was early Fontan complication ≤6 months after surgery, a composite of death, Fontan takedown, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, chest tube drainage >14 days, cardiac catheterization, readmission, or transplant. Complication causes were assigned to 1 of 4 groups: (1) Fontan circuit obstruction, (2) ventricular dysfunction or atrioventricular valve regurgitation, (3) persistent pleural effusions in the absence of Fontan obstruction or ventricular dysfunction, and (4) chylothorax or plastic bronchitis. T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging sequences were used to assess for lymphatic perfusion abnormality. The cohort consisted of 238 patients. Fifty-eight (24%) developed early complications: 20 of 58 (34.5%) in group 1, 8 of 58 (14%) in group 2, 18 of 58 (31%) in group 3, and 12 of 58 (20%) in group 4. Preoperative T2 imaging was available for 126 (53%) patients. Patients with high-grade lymphatic abnormalities had 6 times greater odds of developing early complications (P=0.001). Conclusions There is substantial morbidity in the early post-Fontan period. Half of those who developed early complications had lymphatic failure or persistent effusions unrelated to structural or functional abnormalities. Preoperative T2 imaging demonstrated that patients with higher-grade lymphatic perfusion abnormalities were significantly more likely to develop early complications. This has implications for risk stratification and optimization of patients before Fontan palliation.

The prevalence and prognostic implications of pre-procedural hyperbilirubinemia in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement.  ;Preoperative hyperbilirubinemia is associated with increased mortality and morbidity after cardiac surgery. However, this clinical significance is unclear with transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) procedures. The aims of this study were to determine the prevalence and prognostic implications of preoperative elevations of serum total bilirubin on TAVR outcomes. In 611 consecutive patients who underwent an elective TAVR procedure, 576 patients had recorded serum total bilirubin levels. Hyperbilirubinemia was defined as any value of serum total bilirubin ≥ 1.2 mg/dL obtained within 30-days prior to the TAVR procedure. The primary composite endpoint was post-TAVR all-cause in-hospital mortality or stroke. The overall prevalence of hyperbilirubinemia was 10% (n = 58). There were no patients with a prespecified diagnosis of liver cirrhosis. Pre-TAVR hyperbilirubinemia compared to normal bilirubin level was more common in younger (78 ± 10 vs. 82 ± 8 years old, p < 0.001) males (15 vs. 6%, p < 0.001), with history of pacemaker or ICD (33 vs. 18%, p = 0.005), congestive heart failure New York Heart Association class IV within 2 weeks from TAVR (35 vs. 14%, p < 0.001), severe tricuspid regurgitation (14 vs. 4%, p < 0.001), and atrial fibrillation or flutter (60 vs. 40%, p = 0.004, respectively). Pre-TAVR hyperbilirubinemia was independently associated with an increased post-TAVR in-hospital mortality (7 vs. 2% in normal bilirubin, p = 0.03), stroke (5 vs. 1%, p = 0.019, respectively), and a composite endpoint of death or stroke (12 vs. 3%, p < 0.001). Preoperative hyperbilirubinemia in patients undergoing TAVR is more prevalent than previously considered with multifactorial causes. Hyperbilirubinemia is independently associated with an increased post-TAVR in-hospital mortality and stroke.  
Prevalence of mitral annular disjunction in patients with mitral valve prolapse and severe regurgitation.  ;"Mitral annular disjunction (MAD) is routinely diagnosed by cardiac imaging, mostly by echocardiography, and shown to be a risk factor for ventricular arrhythmias. While MAD is associated with mitral valve (MV) prolapse (MVP), it is unknown which patients with MAD are at higher risk and which additional imaging features may help identify them. The value of cardiac computed tomography (CCT) for the diagnosis of MAD is unknown. Accordingly, we aimed to: (1) develop a standardized CCT approach to identify MAD in patients with MVP and severe mitral regurgitation (MR); (2) determine its prevalence and identify features that are associated with MAD in this population. We retrospectively studied 90 patients (age 63 ± 12 years) with MVP and severe MR, who had pre-operative CCT (256-slice scanner) of sufficient quality for analysis. The presence and degree of MAD was assessed by rotating the view plane around the MV center to visualize disjunction along the annulus. Additionally, detailed measurements of MV apparatus and left heart chambers were performed. Univariate logistic regression analysis was performed to determine which parameters were associated with MAD. MAD was identified in 18 patients (20%), and it was typically located adjacent to a prolapsed or flail mitral leaflet scallop. Of these patients, 75% had maximum MAD distance > 4.8 mm and 90% > 3.8 mm. Female gender was most strongly associated with MAD (p = 0.04). Additionally, smaller end-diastolic mitral annulus area (p = 0.045) and longer posterior leaflet (p = 0.03) were associated with greater MAD. No association was seen between MAD and left ventricular size and function, left atrial size, and papillary muscle geometry. CCT can be used to readily detect MAD, by taking advantage of the 3D nature of this modality. A significant portion of MVP patients referred for mitral valve repair have MAD. The presence of MAD is associated with female gender, smaller annulus size and greater posterior leaflet length.  "
Tricuspid valve replacement: an appraisal of 45 years of experience.  ;OBJECTIVES: This study provides an overview of the change over a 45-year time period in the characteristics and outcome of patients with tricuspid valve disease undergoing surgical tricuspid valve replacement (TVR). METHODS: The characteristics and outcomes of all consecutive TVRs from November 1972 to November 2017 at Erasmus MC were collected retrospectively. A logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify the significant predictors of 30-day mortality. Multivariable Cox regression analysis was used to identify the potential risk factors of patient outcome and the effect of time on these factors. RESULTS: Ninety-eight patients with tricuspid valve dysfunction underwent 114 consecutive TVRs at a mean age of 50.1 ± 17.2 years (68.5% female). Aetiology changed over time from predominantly functional regurgitation (42.9% in 1972-1985) to predominantly carcinoid heart disease (47.7% in 2001-2017). Early mortality declined significantly from 35% in 1972-1985 to 6.7% in 2001-2017 (P < 0.001). Over time, the hazard ratio of late mortality decreased for higher New York Heart Association class, lower preoperative haemoglobin, and high central venous pressure and increased for the presence of preoperative leg oedema, higher creatinine and alkaline phosphatase. The late survival was 43.8% ± 5.89% at 10 years and was comparable among eras (P = 0.44). The cumulative incidence of reoperation at 10 years was 14.1% (2.3-26.0) in biological valves and 4.9% (0.1-10.3) in mechanical valves (P = 0.25). CONCLUSIONS: Patient characteristics, potential risk factors and patient outcome changed considerably over time in patients undergoing TVR. Notably, there was a shift in aetiology, completely altering the patient population and their characteristics.  
Outcomes of aortic coarctation surgical repair in adolescents and adults.  ;"OBJECTIVES: Coarctation of the aorta (CoA) in adolescents and adults is relatively rare. Several operative techniques have been reported, but there is no consensus. METHODS: From November 1994 to July 2018, a total of 24 adolescents and adults underwent CoA repair. The mean age at operation was 29.9 ± 15.1; 19 (79%) patients were older than 18. Sixteen (67%) patients had arterial hypertension, 5 (21%) patients had bicuspid aortic valve, 4 (17%) patients had descending aneurysm, 2 (8%) patients had ascending aneurysm, 2 (8%) patients had patent ductus arteriosus and 1 (4%) patient had atrial septal defect. Three patients had prior surgery (2 CoA repair, 1 ventricular septal defect repair). RESULTS: Surgical corrections included extra-anatomical bypasses in 12 (50%) patients (9: left subclavian artery to descending aorta bypass, 2 proximal-to-distal coarctation bypasses, 1 ascending-to-descending aortic bypass), end-to-end anastomosis in 6 (25%) patients, resections and interpositions of a tube graft in 5 (21%) patients and arch augmentation with a tube graft in 1 (4%) patient. The mean follow-up duration was 6.2 ± 5.1 years. No mortality was observed. No patient required reoperation or reintervention. The mean upper extremity systolic pressure significantly decreased from 142.4 ± 30.3 mmHg preoperatively to 121.1 ± 15.9 mmHg postoperatively (P = 0.002). Arterial pressure gradient between upper and lower extremities significantly decreased from 50.0 ± 21.8 mmHg preoperatively to 9.7 ± 13.5 mmHg postoperatively (P < 0.001). Among patients undergoing left subclavian artery to descending aorta bypass, 8 patients underwent ankle brachial pressure index evaluation. Postoperative mean right- and left-sided ankle brachial pressure index were 0.96 ± 0.16 and 0.94 ± 0.11, respectively. All grafts were patent at the last follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: CoA repair in adolescents and adults showed good outcomes. Left subclavian artery to descending aorta bypass grafting is safe and effective for managing CoA in adolescents and adults.  "

Effect of sub-hypothermia blood purification technique in cardiac shock after valvular disease surgery.  ;"To observe the effect of sub-hypothermia (HT) blood purification technique in the treatment of cardiac shock after heart valve disease.The patients were randomly divided into normothermic (NT) continuous blood purification (CBP) group (NT group) and HT CBP group (HT group). Observe the cardiac index (CI), the oxygen delivery (DO2) and oxygen consumption (VO2) ratio, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation III(APACHE III) score, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) score, dynamic monitoring of electrocardiograph, blood loss with or without muscle tremors, intensive care unit stay, mechanical ventilation time, CBP time, and the cases of infection and mortality at 0 day, 1 day, 2 day, 3 day; all above indicators were compared between 2 groups.Ninety-five patients were randomly assigned into HT group (48 cases) and NT group (47 cases); there were no significant differences between the 2 groups for age, gender, pre-operative cardiac function, cardiothoracic ratio, and type of valve replacement (P > .05). There were no significant differences among the 1 day, 2 day, 3 day after recruited for CI, DO2/VO2 ratio, APACHE III score, MODS score (P > .05). But in HT group, DO2/VO2 ratio had been significantly improved after treatment for 1 day (2.5 ± 0.7 vs 1.8 ± 0.4, P = .024), and CI (3.0 ± 0.5 vs 1.9 ± 0.7, P = .004), APACHE III score (50.6 ± 6.2 vs 77.5 ± 5.5 P = .022), MODS score (6.0 ± 1.5 vs 9.3 ± 3.4, P = .013) also had been significantly improved after treatment for 3 days. In clinical outcomes, there were no significant differences between 2 groups for blood loss (617.0 ± 60.7 ml vs 550.9 ± 85.2 ml, P = .203), infection ratio (54.17% vs 53.19%, P = .341), the incidence of ventricular arrhythmia (31.25% vs 36.17%, P = .237), and muscle tremors (14.58% vs 8.51%, P = .346), while there were significant differences between 2 groups for intensive care unit stay (6.9 ± 3.4 days vs 12.5 ± 3.5 days, P = .017,), mechanical ventilation time (4.2 ± 1.3 days vs 7.5 ± 2.7 days, P = .034,), CBP time (4.6 ± 1.4 days vs 10.5 ± 4.0 days, P = .019), mortality (12.50% vs 23.40%, P = .024). But the incidence of bradycardia in HT group was much higher than the NT group (29.16% vs 14.89%, P = .029).HT blood purification is a safer and more effective treatment than NT blood purification for patients who suffered from cardiac shock after valve surgery.

Facilitators of and barriers to reducing thirty-day readmissions and improving patient-reported outcomes after surgical aortic valve replacement: a process evaluation of the AVRre trial.  ;"BACKGROUND: The Aortic Valve Replacement Readmission (AVRre) randomized control trial tested whether a telephone intervention would reduce hospital readmissions following surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). The telephone support provided 30 days of continuous phone-support (hotline) and two scheduled phone-calls from the hospital after discharge. The intervention had no effect on reducing 30-day all-cause readmission rate (30-DACR) but did reduce participants' anxiety compared to a control group receiving usual care. Depression and participant-reported health state were unaffected by the intervention. To better understand these outcomes, we conducted a process evaluation of the AVRre trial to gain insight into the (1) the dose and fidelity of the intervention, (2) mechanism of impacts, and (3) contextual factors that may have influenced the outcomes. METHODS: The process evaluation was informed by the Medical Research Council framework, a widely used set of guidelines for evaluating complex interventions. A mix of quantitative (questionnaire and journal records) and qualitative data (field notes, memos, registration forms, questionnaire) was prospectively collected, and retrospective interviews were conducted. We performed descriptive analyses of the quantitative data. Content analyses, assisted by NVivo, were performed to evaluate qualitative data. RESULTS: The nurses who were serving the 24/7 hotline intervention desired to receive more preparation before intervention implementation. SAVR patient participants were highly satisfied with the telephone intervention (58%), felt safe (86%), and trusted having the option of calling in for support (91%). The support for the telephone hotline staff was perceived as a facilitator of the intervention implementation. Content analyses revealed themes: ""gap in the care continuum,"" ""need for individualized care,"" and ""need for easy access to health information"" after SAVR. Differences in local hospital discharge management practices influenced the 30-DACR incidence. CONCLUSIONS: The prospective follow-up of the hotline service during the trial facilitated implementation of the intervention, contributing to high participant satisfaction and likely reduced their anxiety after SAVR. Perceived less-than-optimal preparations for the hotline could be a barrier to AVRre trial implementation. Integrating user experiences into a mixed-methods evaluation of clinical trials is important for broadening understanding of trial outcomes, the mechanism of impact, and contextual factors that influence clinical trials.

[Genetic analysis of a child with atypical Williams-Beuren syndrome presenting as supravalvular aortic stenosis].  ;OBJECTIVE: To explore the genetic basis for a child with supravalvular aortic stenosis. METHODS: The child and his parents were subjected to conventional G-banding karyotyping, array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) analysis. RESULTS: No karyotypic abnormality was detected in the child and his parents. aCGH has identified a de novo 278 kb deletion encompassing the ELN gene in 7q11.23, which overlapped with the critical region of Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS). MLPA has confirmed above findings. CONCLUSION: The proband was diagnosed with atypical WBS. Deletion of the ELN gene may predispose to supravalvular aortic stenosis in the proband.  
Favorable outcome of cancer patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement.  ;"AIM: The aim of this study was to assess the outcome of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in patients with cancer. METHODS: This is a retrospective study from the nationwide FinnValve registry on 2130 consecutive patients who underwent TAVR for severe AS from January 2008 to October 2017. RESULTS: In this cohort, 417 patients (19.6%) had history of cancer and 113 (5.3%) had an active malignancy at the time of TAVR. Patients with any malignancy had similar late mortality than patients without any malignancy (at 7 years, 65.1% vs. 59.3%, adjusted HR 1.105, 95%CI 0.892-1.369). At 7 years, cancer-related mortality was 22.5% among patients with preoperative cancer, and 11.0% in those without preoperative cancer (p < 0.0001). Among cancer patients, 18 died of the same disease (at 7 years, mortality 12.5%). Active malignancy was not associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality (adjusted HR 1.100, 95%CI 0.757-1.599). However, patients with blood malignancies had a significantly increased risk of mortality (at 4-year, 53.5% vs. 35.4%, adjusted HR 2.029, 95%CI 1.328-3.098). CONCLUSIONS: This analysis showed that, when properly selected by the heart team and oncologists, most cancer patients undergoing TAVR can achieve a good survival and eventually die of other diseases. Blood malignancies seem to carry a poor prognosis in these patients. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03385915; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03385915.  "
Transcatheter Electrosurgery: JACC State-of-the-Art Review.  ;"Transcatheter electrosurgery refers to a family of procedures using radiofrequency energy to vaporize and traverse or lacerate tissue despite flowing blood. The authors review theory, simulations, and benchtop demonstrations of how guidewires, insulation, adjunctive catheters, and dielectric medium interact. For tissue traversal, all but the tip of traversing guidewires is insulated to concentrate current. For leaflet laceration, the ""Flying V"" configuration concentrates current at the inner lacerating surface of a kinked guidewire. Flooding the field with non-ionic dextrose eliminates alternative current paths. Clinical applications include traversing occlusions (pulmonary atresia, arterial and venous occlusion, and iatrogenic graft occlusion), traversing tissue planes (atrial and ventricular septal puncture, radiofrequency valve repair, transcaval access, Potts and Glenn shunts), and leaflet laceration (BASILICA, LAMPOON, ELASTA-Clip, and others). Tips are provided for optimizing these techniques. Transcatheter electrosurgery already enables a range of novel therapeutic procedures for structural heart disease, and represents a promising advance toward transcatheter surgery.  "
Preventing Complications in Pregnant Women With Cardiac Disease.  ;"BACKGROUND: Pregnancy can lead to complications in women with heart disease, and these complications can be life threatening. Understanding serious complications and how they can be prevented is important. OBJECTIVES: The primary objectives were to determine the incidence of serious cardiac events (SCEs) in pregnant women with heart disease, whether they were preventable, and their impact on fetal and neonatal outcomes. Serious obstetric events were also examined. METHODS: A prospectively assembled cohort of 1,315 pregnancies in women with heart disease was studied. SCEs included cardiac death or arrest, ventricular arrhythmias, congestive heart failure or arrhythmias requiring admission to an intensive care unit, myocardial infarction, stroke, aortic dissection, valve thrombosis, endocarditis, and urgent cardiac intervention. The Harvard Medical Study criteria were used to adjudicate preventability. RESULTS: Overall, 3.6% of pregnancies (47 of 1,315) were complicated by SCEs. The most frequent SCEs were cardiac death or arrest, heart failure, arrhythmias, and urgent interventions. Most SCEs (66%) occurred in the antepartum period. Almost one-half of SCEs (49%) were preventable; the majority of preventable SCEs (74%) were secondary to provider management factors. Adverse fetal and neonatal events were more common in pregnancies with SCEs compared with those without cardiac events (62% vs. 29%; p < 0.001). Serious obstetric events were less common (1.7%) and were primarily due to pre-eclampsia with severe features. CONCLUSIONS: Pregnant women with heart disease are at risk for serious cardiac complications, and approximately one-half of all SCEs are preventable. Strategies to prevent serious cardiac complications in this high-risk cohort of women need to be developed.  "
Incidence of Ischemic Stroke in Individuals With and Without Aortic Valve Stenosis: A Danish Retrospective Cohort Study.  ;Background and Purpose- Aortic valve stenosis may lead to atrial and ventricular remodeling, predisposes to atrial fibrillation, and may also be an independent risk factor of ischemic stroke. However, information on stroke rates among persons with aortic valve stenosis are sparse. We aimed to determine the incidence rates and relative risks of ischemic stroke in individuals with diagnosed aortic valve stenosis compared with age- and sex-matched controls. Methods- All patients with incident aortic valve stenosis aged >18 years (n=79 310) and age- and sex-matched controls were identified using the Danish nationwide registries (1997-2017). Incidence rates per 1000 person-years (PY) and multivariable adjusted hazard ratios with 95% CIs were reported. Results- In total, 873 373 individuals (median age 77 years, 51.5% men, 9.1% with aortic valve stenosis) were included. Ischemic stroke occurred in 70 205 (8.0%) individuals during 4 880 862 PY of follow-up. Incidence rates of ischemic stroke were 13.3/1000 PY among the controls compared with 30.4/1000 PY in patients with aortic valve stenosis, corresponding to a hazard ratio of 1.31 (95% CI, 1.28-1.34). In all age-groups, the incidence rates and relative risks were significantly increased in patients with aortic valve stenosis compared with controls, but the relative risk was greater for younger individuals (eg, age group, 18-45 years: hazard ratio, 5.94 [95% CI, 4.10-8.36]). In patients with aortic valve stenosis above 65 years of age, the risk of ischemic stroke was markedly lower after aortic valve replacement (30.3 versus 19.6/1000 PY before and after valve replacement). Among people with atrial fibrillation the incidence rate of ischemic stroke was 1.5 times higher when aortic valve stenosis was present (33.0/1000 PY versus 49.9/1000 PY). Conclusions- People with aortic valve stenosis have a significantly increased risk of ischemic stroke compared with age- and sex-matched controls. Future studies are warranted to explore whether antithrombotic therapy may be beneficial in some individuals.  
Procedural, pregnancy, and short-term outcomes after fetal aortic valvuloplasty.  ;OBJECTIVES: We aimed to evaluate the effect of technical aspects of fetal aortic valvuloplasty (FAV) on procedural risks and pregnancy outcomes. BACKGROUND: FAV is performed in cases of severe mid-gestation aortic stenosis with the goal of preventing hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS). METHODS: The International Fetal Cardiac Intervention Registry was queried for fetuses who underwent FAV from 2002 to 2018, excluding one high-volume center. RESULTS: The 108 fetuses had an attempted cardiac puncture (mean gestational age [GA] 26.1 ± 3.3 weeks). 83.3% of attempted interventions were technically successful (increased forward flow/new aortic insufficiency). The interventional cannula was larger than 19 g in 70.4%. More than one cardiac puncture was performed in 25.0%. Intraprocedural complications occurred in 48.1%, including bradycardia (34.1%), pericardial (22.2%) or pleural effusion (2.7%) requiring drainage, and balloon rupture (5.6%). Death within 48 hr occurred in 16.7% of fetuses. Of the 81 patients born alive, 59 were discharged home, 34 of whom had biventricular circulation. More than one cardiac puncture was associated with higher complication rates (p < .001). Larger cannula size was associated with higher pericardial effusion rates (p = .044). On multivariate analysis, technical success (odds ratio [OR] = 10.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.2-53.5, p = .003) and later GA at intervention (OR = 1.5, 95% CI = 1.2-1.9, p = .002) were associated with increased odds of live birth. CONCLUSIONS: FAV is an often successful but high-risk procedure. Multiple cardiac punctures are associated with increased complication and fetal mortality rates. Later GA at intervention and technical success were independently associated with increased odds of live birth. However, performing the procedure later in gestation may miss the window to prevent progression to HLHS.  
Characteristics and outcomes of atrial fibrillation in patients without traditional risk factors: an RE-LY AF registry analysis.  ;"AIMS : Data on patient characteristics, prevalence, and outcomes of atrial fibrillation (AF) patients without traditional risk factors, often labelled 'lone AF', are sparse. METHODS AND RESULTS: The RE-LY AF registry included 15 400 individuals who presented to emergency departments with AF in 47 countries. This analysis focused on patients without traditional risk factors, including age ≥60 years, hypertension, coronary artery disease, heart failure, left ventricular hypertrophy, congenital heart disease, pulmonary disease, valve heart disease, hyperthyroidism, and prior cardiac surgery. Patients without traditional risk factors were compared with age- and region-matched controls with traditional risk factors (1:3 fashion). In 796 (5%) patients, no traditional risk factors were present. However, 98% (779/796) had less-established or borderline risk factors, including borderline hypertension (130-140/80-90 mmHg; 47%), chronic kidney disease (eGFR < 60 mL/min; 57%), obesity (body mass index > 30; 19%), diabetes (5%), excessive alcohol intake (>14 units/week; 4%), and smoking (25%). Compared with patients with traditional risk factors (n = 2388), patients without traditional risk factors were more often men (74% vs. 59%, P < 0.001) had paroxysmal AF (55% vs. 37%, P < 0.001) and less AF persistence after 1 year (21% vs. 49%, P < 0.001). Furthermore, 1-year stroke occurrence rate (0.6% vs. 2.0%, P = 0.013) and heart failure hospitalizations (0.9% vs. 12.5%, P < 0.001) were lower. However, risk of AF-related re-hospitalization was similar (18% vs. 21%, P = 0.09). CONCLUSION: Almost all patients without traditionally defined AF risk factors have less-established or borderline risk factors. These patients have a favourable 1-year prognosis, but risk of AF-related re-hospitalization remains high. Greater emphasis should be placed on recognition and management of less-established or borderline risk factors.  "

Impact of Valvular Heart Disease on Mortality, Thromboembolic and Cardiac Events in Japanese Patients With Atrial Fibrillation　- The Fushimi AF Registry.  ;"BACKGROUND: There is a growing burden of valvular heart disease (VHD) and atrial fibrillation (AF) due to population aging, but data regarding the characteristics and outcomes of patients with AF and concomitant VHD are lacking.Methods and Results:The Fushimi AF Registry is a community-based prospective survey of AF patients in Fushimi-ku, Kyoto. Among 3,566 patients with available echocardiographic data, 20% had VHD, consisting of 131 valvular AF (VAF: 3.7%) and 583 nonvalvular AF with VHD (NVAF-VHD: 16.3%). Here, VAF was defined as AF with mitral stenosis or a prosthetic heart valve. AF patients with VHD were older, had more comorbidities with a higher CHADS2 score, and were prescribed oral anticoagulants more frequently than those without VHD. After adjusting for confounders, VHD was not associated with stroke or systemic embolism, all-cause mortality, or cardiac death. NVAF-VHD was significantly associated with an increased risk of hospitalization for heart failure (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.44; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.16-1.78), whereas VAF was not (HR, 1.28; 95% CI, 0.86-1.92). Among all types of VHD, aortic valve diseases were associated with a higher risk of cardiac events, whereas mitral valve diseases were not. CONCLUSIONS: Although VHD did not significantly affect thromboembolism or mortality, it affected cardiac events depending on type, with aortic valve diseases having higher risk, in Japanese patients with AF.

Impact of valve morphology, hypertension and age on aortic wall properties in patients with coarctation: a two-centre cross-sectional study.  ;OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate the combined effects of arterial hypertension, bicuspid aortic valve disease (BAVD) and age on the distensibility of the ascending and descending aortas in patients with aortic coarctation. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: The study was conducted at two university medical centres, located in Berlin and London. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 121 patients with aortic coarctation (ages 1-71 years) underwent cardiac MRI, echocardiography and blood pressure measurements. OUTCOME MEASURES: Cross-sectional diameters of the ascending and descending aortas were assessed to compute aortic area distensibility. Findings were compared with age-specific reference values. The study complied with the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology statement and reporting guidelines. RESULTS: Impaired distensibility (below fifth percentile) was seen in 37% of all patients with coarctation in the ascending aorta and in 43% in the descending aorta. BAVD (43%) and arterial hypertension (72%) were present across all ages. In patients >10 years distensibility impairment of the ascending aorta was predominantly associated with BAVD (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.33 to 7.22, p=0.009). Distensibility impairment of the descending aorta was predominantly associated with arterial hypertension (OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.08 to 7.2, p=0.033) and was most pronounced in patients with uncontrolled hypertension despite antihypertensive treatment. CONCLUSION: From early adolescence on, both arterial hypertension and BAVD have a major impact on aortic distensibility. Their specific effects differ in strength and localisation (descending vs ascending aorta). Moreover, adequate blood pressure control is associated with improved distensibility. These findings could contribute to the understanding of cardiovascular complications and the management of patients with aortic coarctation.  
''Chimney'' Bentall Procedure in the Small Aortic Root After Prior Aortic Valve Operations.  ;The ''Chimney'' Bentall procedure using a self-assembled valve composite graft has been performed in 24 patients with a small aortic root or annulus after previous valve replacement in our center. The mean diameter of the aortic annulus was 19.58 ± 1.8 mm. During the procedure, the mean size of the implanted aortic valve prosthesis was 22.75 ± 1.78 mm. The mean gradient across the aortic valve prosthesis was 11.17 ± 2.24 mm Hg. This technique allows for the implantation of a larger prosthesis in patients with a small aortic annulus or root after previous aortic valve operation and results in good postoperative hemodynamic characteristics and early clinical results.  
Everolimus Rescues the Phenotype of Elastin Insufficiency in Patient Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells.  ;OBJECTIVE: Elastin gene deletion or mutation leads to arterial stenoses due to vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation. Human induced pluripotent stem cells-derived SMCs can model the elastin insufficiency phenotype in vitro but show only partial rescue with rapamycin. Our objective was to identify drug candidates with superior efficacy in rescuing the SMC phenotype in elastin insufficiency patients. Approach and Results: SMCs generated from induced pluripotent stem cells from 5 elastin insufficiency patients with severe recurrent vascular stenoses (3 Williams syndrome and 2 elastin mutations) were phenotypically immature, hyperproliferative, poorly responsive to endothelin, and exerted reduced tension in 3-dimensional smooth muscle biowires. Elastin mRNA and protein were reduced in SMCs from patients compared to healthy control SMCs. Fourteen drug candidates were tested on patient SMCs. Of the mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors studied, everolimus restored differentiation, rescued proliferation, and improved endothelin-induced calcium flux in all patient SMCs except one Williams syndrome. Of the calcium channel blockers, verapamil increased SMC differentiation and reduced proliferation in Williams syndrome patient cells but not in elastin mutation patients and had no effect on endothelin response. Combination treatment with everolimus and verapamil was not superior to everolimus alone. Other drug candidates had limited efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: Everolimus caused the most consistent improvement in SMC differentiation, proliferation and in SMC function in patients with both syndromic and nonsyndromic elastin insufficiency, and offers the best candidate for drug repurposing for treatment of elastin insufficiency associated vasculopathy.  
Impact of combined baseline and postprocedural troponin values on clinical outcome following the MitraClip procedure.  ;"OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of periprocedural troponin levels on clinical outcome following the MitraClip procedure. BACKGROUND: Cardiac troponin is known to be a predictive biomarker for various clinical outcomes; however, data about its predictive value in patients undergoing transcatheter mitral valve repair are limited. METHODS: Consecutive patients undergoing the MitraClip procedure were enrolled. Serum cardiac troponin I concentrations were measured before and after the procedure, and the maximal value recorded within 72 hr after the procedure was used for the postprocedural values. The clinical outcome was all-cause mortality within a 1-year follow-up. RESULTS: Out of 354 patients, 29 patients (8.2%) were deceased within 1 year. Patients who died had significantly higher baseline (0.05 [0.01-0.08] vs. 0.01 [0.01-0.03] ng/ml; p < .001) and postprocedural troponin I values (0.51 [0.30-1.42] vs. 0.20 [0.33-0.55] ng/ml; p = .005). A Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that patients with higher baseline troponin I values had a significantly worse prognosis than those with lower values (log-rank p < .001), and similarly, 1-year mortality was significantly higher in patients with higher postprocedural troponin I than those with lower levels (log-rank p = .021). Moreover, the highest mortality rate was observed in patients with both elevated baseline and postprocedural troponin I values (log-rank p = .001), which was found to be an independent predictor of mortality by multivariable analyses. CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that combined baseline and postprocedural troponin measurements are useful for risk stratification of 1-year mortality following the MitraClip procedure.  "
Prevalence of permanent pacemaker implantation after conventional aortic valve replacement-a propensity-matched analysis in patients with a bicuspid or tricuspid aortic valve: a benchmark for transcatheter aortic valve replacement.  ;"OBJECTIVES: Elective treatment of aortic valve disease by transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is becoming increasingly popular, even in patients with low risk and intermediate risk. Even patients with a bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) are increasingly considered eligible for TAVR. Permanent pacemaker implantation (PMI) is a known-frequently understated-complication of TAVR affecting 9-15% of TAVR patients with a potentially significant impact on longevity and quality of life. BAV patients are affected by the highest PMI rates, although they are frequently younger compared to their tricuspid peers. The aim of the study is to report benchmark data-from a high-volume centre (with a competitive TAVR programme) on PMI after isolated surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in patients with BAV and tricuspid aortic valve (TAV). METHODS: We performed a retrospective single-centre analysis on 4154 patients receiving isolated SAVRs (w/o concomitant procedures), between 2000 and 2019, of whom 1108 had BAV (27%). PMI rate and early- and long-term outcomes were analysed. For better comparability of these demographically unequal cohorts, 1:1 nearest neighbour matching was performed. RESULTS: At the time of SAVR, BAV patients were on average 10 years younger than their TAV peers (59.7 ± 12 vs 69.3 ± 9; P < 0.001) and had less comorbidities; all relevant characteristics were equally balanced after statistical matching. Overall PMI rate was significantly higher in BAV patients (5.4% vs 3.8%; P = 0.03). BAV required PMI exclusively (100%) and TAV required predominately (96%) for persistent postoperative high-degree atrioventricular block. After matching, the PMI rate was similar (5.1% vs 4.4%, P = 0.5). In-hospital mortality in the matched cohort was 1% in both groups. Long-term survival was more favourable in BAV patients (94% vs 90% in TAV at 5 years; 89% vs 82% in TAV at 9 years; P = 0.013). CONCLUSIONS: With SAVR, the overall incidence of PMI among BAV patients seems significantly higher; however, after propensity matching, no difference in PMI rates between BAV and TAV is evident. The PMI rate was remarkably lower among BAV patients after SAVR compared to the reported incidence after TAVR.  "
"Multifocal cardiovascular calcification in patients with established cardiovascular disease; prevalence, risk factors, and relation with recurrent cardiovascular disease.  ";"AIMS: The aim is to investigate (multifocal) cardiovascular calcification in patients with established cardiovascular disease (CVD), regarding prevalence, risk factors, and relation with recurrent CVD or vascular interventions. Coronary artery calcification (CAC), thoracic aortic calcification (TAC) (including ascending aorta, aortic arch, descending aorta), mitral annular calcification (MAC), and aortic valve calcification (AVC) are studied. METHODS: The study concerned 568 patients with established CVD enrolled in the ORACLE cohort. All patients underwent computed tomography. Prevalence of site-specific and multifocal calcification was determined. Ordinal regression analyses were performed to quantify associations of risk factors with cardiovascular calcification, and Cox regression analyses to determine the relation between calcium scores and recurrent CVD or vascular interventions. RESULTS: Calcification was multifocal in 76% (N = 380) of patients with calcification. Age (per SD) was associated with calcification at all locations (lowest OR 2.17; 99%CI 1.54-3.11 for ascending aorta calcification). Diabetes mellitus and systolic blood pressure were associated with TAC, whereas male sex was a determinant of CAC. TAC and CAC were related to the combined endpoint CVD or vascular intervention (N = 68). In a model with all calcium scores combined, only CAC was related to the combined outcome (HR 1.39; 95%CI 1.15-1.68). CONCLUSION: Cardiovascular calcification is generally multifocal in patients with established CVD. Differences in associations between risk factors and calcification at various anatomical locations stress the divergence in pathophysiological pathways. CAC is most strongly related to recurrent CVD or vascular interventions independent of traditional risk factors, and independent of heart valve and thoracic aorta calcification.  "
Short- and long-term outcomes of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest following ST-elevation myocardial infarction managed with percutaneous coronary intervention.  ;"AIM: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is frequently associated with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and has a high mortality. We aimed to identify differences in characteristics and very long-term outcomes for STEMI patients with and without OHCA managed with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). METHODS: We analysed data from 12,637 PCI patient procedures for STEMI in the multi-centre Melbourne Interventional Group registry between January 2005 and December 2018. Multivariable models examined associations with OHCA presentation and 30-day mortality. Long-term outcomes were assessed through linkage with the Australian National Death Index. RESULTS: Compared with patients without OHCA (N = 11,580), patients with OHCA (N = 1057) were younger, more often male, had less cardiovascular risk factors, and more often presented with cardiogenic shock. OHCA preceded an increasing proportion of STEMI PCI cases from 2005 to 2018 (2.4% vs. 9.2%). Factors independently associated with OHCA presentation were younger age, male gender, prior valve surgery, multi-vessel disease, LAD culprit, small vessel diameter, and renal impairment on presentation. Patients with OHCA had lower procedural success, higher rates of bleeding and stroke, larger infarct size (measured by peak CK), and higher 30-day mortality (37% vs. 5%; all p < 0.05). Cardiogenic shock, renal impairment and lower ejection fraction were independently associated with 30-day mortality. Long-term mortality was 44% vs. 20% (median follow-up 4.6 years), with Cox regression analysis demonstrating no difference in survival if patients survived beyond 30 days (HR 1.18, 95% CI 0.95-1.47). CONCLUSIONS: OHCA has a high short-term mortality and precedes an increasing proportion of STEMI PCI cases. Thirty-day survivors have an excellent long-term prognosis.  "
Disappearance of the shunt and lower cardiac index during exercise in small, unrepaired ventricular septal defects.  ;OBJECTIVES: Clinical studies have revealed decreased exercise capacity in adults with small, unrepaired ventricular septal defects. Increasing shunt ratio and growing incompetence of the aortic and pulmonary valve with retrograde flow during exercise have been proposed as reasons for the previously found reduced exercise parameters. With MRI, haemodynamic shunt properties were measured during exercise in ventricular septal defects. METHODS: Patients with small, unrepaired ventricular septal defects and healthy peers were examined with MRI during exercise. Quantitative flow scans measured blood flow through ascending aorta and pulmonary artery. Scans were analysed post hoc where cardiac index, retrograde flows, and shunt ratio were determined. RESULTS: In total, 32 patients (26 ± 6 years) and 28 controls (27 ± 5 years) were included. The shunt ratio was 1.2 ± 0.2 at rest and decreased to 1.0 ± 0.2 at peak exercise, p < 0.01. Aortic cardiac index was lower at peak exercise in patients (7.5 ± 2 L/minute/m2) compared with controls (9.0±2L l/minute/m2), p<0.01. Aortic and pulmonary retrograde flow was larger in patients during exercise, p < 0.01. Positive correlation was demonstrated between aortic cardiac index at peak exercise and previously established exercise capacity for all patients (r = 0.5, p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Small, unrepaired ventricular septal defects revealed declining shunt ratio with increasing exercise and lower aortic cardiac index. Patients demonstrated larger retrograde flow both through the pulmonary artery and the aorta during exercise compared with controls. In conclusion, adults with unrepaired ventricular septal defects redistribute blood flow during exercise probably secondary to a more fixed pulmonary vascular resistance compared with age-matched peers.

Anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery: A surgical certainty.  ;This study aims to assess the clinical presentation and the outcomes of a surgical correction of an anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA). A retrospective review was carried out on the charts of six patients admitted for ALCAPA surgery at Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi from March 2017 to May 2018.Dyspnoea, palpitation, poor feeding, fatiguability, pallor and a murmur of mitral regurgitation were the main presenting features. The pre-operative median left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 64%. Coronary reimplantation was performed in all the patients with a mitral valve repair being done in only one patient. The mea n LV EF was 66 .3%,p ost- ope rativel y. Mitra l regurgitation (MR) improved in patients post-operatively with trace in 2 patients and mild MR in one. Surgical correction by coronary re-implantation yields favourable outcomes in ALCAPA and significantly reduces the morbidity and mortality rates associated with the disease.

MYH7B variants cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy by activating the CaMK-signaling pathway.  ;"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a common genetic disease, predominantly caused by mutations in cardiac sarcomere genes; however, whether MYH7B causes HCM is not known. In this study, 549 unrelated patients with HCM and 500 healthy-controls were screened using targeted sequencing and whole exome sequencing together. We observed seven variants in MYH7B causing HCM in 8/549 patients, which accounted for 1.46% of HCM cases. Of these seven variants, three likely pathogenic variants in MYH7B co-segregating with 5 HCM patients were identified in three HCM pedigrees without other HCM-associated variants. Myh7b knockout rats were generated and cardiac functions were detected by Millar pressure-volume catheterization and echocardiography. Spontaneous HCM phenotypes, cellular disarray and cardiac fibrosis were observed in both Myh7b+/-/Myh7b-/- rats. Transcriptome sequencing showed that calcium is the key mediator of cardiac hypertrophy in Myh7b knockout. Subsequent analysis confirmed over-activation of CaMK-signaling pathway in cardiomyocytes of Myh7b-/- rats. Furthermore, MYH7B expression in human and rat hearts was identified and microRNA-208a and microRNA-499 levels are unchanged in HCM patients and Myh7b+/-/Myh7b-/- rats. This study is the first to identifyMYH7B variants as cause of HCM, which account for 1.46% of pathogenesisin HCM patients. Activation of CaMK-signaling pathway may be involved in its pathophysiology.  "
Isolated surgical tricuspid repair versus replacement: meta-analysis of 15 069 patients.  ;OBJECTIVES: Tricuspid valve disease is increasingly encountered, but surgery is rarely performed in isolation, in part because of a reported higher operative risk than other single-valve operations. Although guidelines recommend valve repair, there is sparse literature for the optimal surgical approach in isolated tricuspid valve disease. We performed a meta-analysis examining outcomes of isolated tricuspid valve repair versus replacement. METHODS: We searched Pubmed, Embase, Scopus and Cochrane from January 1980 to June 2019 for studies reporting outcomes of both isolated tricuspid valve repair and replacement, excluding congenital tricuspid aetiologies. Data were extracted and pooled using random-effects models and Review Manager 5.3 software. RESULTS: There were 811 article abstracts screened, from which 52 full-text articles reviewed and 16 studies included, totalling 6808 repairs and 8261 replacements. Mean age ranged from 36 to 68 years and females made up 24%-92% of these studies. Pooled operative mortality rates and odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) for isolated tricuspid repair and replacement surgery were 8.4% vs 9.9%, 0.80 (0.64 to 1.00). Tricuspid repair was also associated with lower in-hospital acute renal failure 12.4% vs 15.6%, 0.82 (0.72 to 0.93) and pacemaker implantation 9.4% vs 21.0%, 0.37 (0.24 to 0.58), but higher stroke rate 1.5% vs 0.9%, 1.63 (1.10 to 2.41). There were no differences in rates of prolonged ventilation, mediastinitis, return to operating room or late mortality. CONCLUSION: Isolated tricuspid valve repair was associated with significantly reduced in-hospital mortality, renal failure and pacemaker implantation compared with replacement and is therefore recommended where feasible for isolated tricuspid valve disease, although its higher stroke rate warrants further research.  
Hypertension in aortic stenosis: a focused review and recommendations for clinical practice.  ;: In patients with aortic stenosis, the presence of hypertension negatively affects the hemodynamic severity of the stenosis, and worsens adverse left ventricular remodeling. It accelerates the progression of the stenosis and is associated with worse prognosis. Proper management of hypertension is thus crucial but there are concerns about the safety and efficacy of antihypertensive medications as well as uncertainty about optimal blood pressure (BP) targets and their impact on left ventricular mass regression and survival benefits. In the present review, we discuss these issues based on the evidence available in the current literature. Focus is first directed on the consequences of a persistently elevated BP before and after surgical aortic valve replacement or transcatheter valve implantation, and the clinical significance of an abnormal BP response during exercise in patients with significant aortic stenosis. Available data on use of antihypertensive drugs are then critically addressed, the conclusion being that calcium channel blockers may be associated with lower survival, and that diuretics may have disadvantages in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy and smaller left ventricular cavity dimensions, β-blockers may be well tolerated and a better choice for patients with concomitant coronary artery disease and arrhythmias. Renin--angiotensin system blockers improve survival given either before or after valve intervention. Emphasis is placed on the fact that evidence is not derived from randomized trials but only from observational studies. Finally, we discuss the optimal SBP level to reach in patients with aortic stenosis. Again, randomized trials are not available but observational evidence suggests that values between 130 and 139 mmHg systolic and 70-90 mmHg diastolic might represent the best option, and lower BP targets should probably be avoided.  
Prognostic Value of N-Terminal Pro-form B-Type Natriuretic Peptide in Patients With Moderate Aortic Stenosis.  ;"Plasma B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and its N-terminal pro-form, NT-proBNP, can predict outcomes in patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS). However, their prognostic value in moderate AS is currently unknown. The present study included 261 patients diagnosed with moderate AS (1.0 <aortic valve area ≤1.5 cm2) in 2012 with serum NT-pro BNP level collected within ±3 months of the echocardiographic assessment. Patients were divided into 2 groups according to the median NT-proBNP value (888 pg/dl) and all-cause mortality compared. Median age was 78 years and 64% of patients were male. There were 131 (50%) patients with lower-median NT-pro BNP levels (≤888 pg/dl) and 130 (50%) with higher-median NT-pro BNP levels (>888 pg/dl). During a median follow up of 2.7 years, there were 136 (52%) deaths. Mortality rate was much higher in patients with higher-median NT-pro BNP compared to those with lower-median NT-pro BNP levels (p <0.001). Higher-median NT-pro BNP level was significantly associated with higher mortality rate (hazard ratio 3.11; 95% confidence interval 1.78 to 5.46, p <0.001) even after adjusting for confounders. Aortic valve replacement (AVR) was performed in 82 (31%) patients and median time to AVR was 2.1 years. Patients with higher-median NT-pro BNP had higher mortality rate compared to patients with lower-median NT-pro BNP even after AVR (p <0.01). In conclusion, higher NT-proBNP level is associated with higher mortality rates in patients with moderate AS even among those undergoing AVR.  "
Long-Term Outcomes in Patients With Mixed Aortic Valve Disease and Preserved Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction.  ;"Background Concurrent presence of aortic stenosis and aortic regurgitation is termed mixed aortic valve disease (MAVD). Although multiple articles have addressed patients with ""isolated"" aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation, the natural history, impact, and outcomes of MAVD are not well defined. Here, we evaluate long-term outcomes in patients with MAVD and cardiovascular adaptations to chronic MAVD. Methods and Results This observational cohort study evaluated 862 adult patients (56.8% male) with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction and at least moderate aortic regurgitation and moderate aortic stenosis. Primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Subgroup analysis was based on treatment modality (aortic valve replacement [AVR] versus medical management). A regression analysis of longitudinal echocardiographic parameters was performed to assess the natural history of MAVD. Mean age was 68±15 years, and mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 58±5%. At 4.6 years (25th-75th percentile range, 1.0-8.7), 58.6% of patients underwent an AVR and 48.8% patients died. In both unadjusted and adjusted Cox survival analysis, AVR was associated with improved survival (hazard ratio, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.34-0.51, P<0.001). Impact of AVR persisted when stratifying the cohort by symptom status and baseline aortic valve area (log rank, P<0.001 for both) and after propensity-score matching (hazard ratio, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.32-0.50; P<0.001). In the longitudinal analysis, there were statistically significant changes over time in aortic valve peak gradient (P<0.001) and aortic valve area (P<0.001) and only mild increases in left ventricular end-diastolic (P<0.007) and -systolic (P<0.001) volumes. Conclusions MAVD confers a high risk of all-cause mortality. However, AVR significantly reduces this risk independent of aortic valve area, symptom status, and after controlling for confounding variables.  "
Lak HM(1), Goyal A(2).  ;"Cardiac stress testing is the most commonly used modality for diagnostic purposes in patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease (CAD). The utility of stress testing should be interpreted based on the likelihood of the disease. Patients with a low probability of disease have a high risk of false-positive results and may end up further unnecessary invasive testing without changing patient outcomes. Those with high pretest probability have a high risk of false-negative results that can miss a critical diagnosis; therefore, these patients should proceed directly to more confirmatory testing such as cardiac catheterization. Stress testing is most clinically useful in intermediate-risk patients for CAD that will help further reclassify these patients into low risk and high-risk depending on the stress test result. Stress testing can also be used to obtain prognostic information to determine the patient's response to optical medical therapy, measure exercise capacity, evaluate ischemia who are already started on medical therapy for known CAD. In general exercise, stress is preferred because it provides a gauge of functional capacity, exercise tolerance, and symptom provocation. Pharmacologic stress testing is an alternative modality in patients who are unable to exercise and with the following conditions: 1. Patients presenting with unstable angina. 2. History of heart failure which is not well controlled, and there is a concern for deterioration. 3. Poorly controlled blood pressure with systolic blood pressure significantly higher (>200 mmHg at rest). 4. Patients with a history of aortic stenosis which is significantly worse on echocardiogram (aortic valve area <1.0 cm2 and mean gradient >40 mmHg) and have ongoing symptoms. 5. Myocardial infarction in the last week. 6. Acute pulmonary embolism. 7. Acute inflammation of pericardium or myocardium. 8. Severe pulmonary hypertension. Exercise stress testing is also not very helpful in patients with an insufficient hemodynamic response to exercise due to abnormalities involving the respiratory system, and having ongoing issues involving muscles, bones, and vessels in the peripheral system. Also, the exercise stress test is not useful when baseline EKG is abnormal such as with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), left bundle branch block (LBBB), paced rhythm, Wolff Parkinson White (WPW) syndrome, or greater than 1 mm ST-segment depression. These patients are suitable candidates for testing involving pharmacologic agents. Pharmacologic stress testing is used in combination with imaging modalities such as radionuclide imaging and echocardiography.  "
Surgical Complexity and Outcome of Patients Undergoing Re-do Aortic Valve Surgery.  ;OBJECTIVES: Re-do aortic valve surgery carries a higher mortality and morbidity compared with first time aortic valve replacement (AVR) and often requires concomitant complex procedures. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is an option for selective patients. The aim of this study is to present our experience with re-do aortic valve procedures and give an insight into the characteristics of these patients and their outcomes. METHODS: Retrospective review of 80 consecutive re-do aortic valve procedures. RESULTS: Mean patients' age was 51.80±18.73 years. Aortic regurgitation (AR) was present in 51 (65.4%) patients and aortic stenosis (AS) in 38 (48.7%). Indications for reoperation were: infective endocarditis (IE) (23.8%), bioprosthetic degeneration (12.5%), mechanical valve dysfunction (5%), paravalvular leak (6.2%), patient-prosthesis mismatch (3.8%), native valve disease (25%), aortic aneurysm, pseudoaneurysm and dissection (35%), aortic root/homograft degeneration (27.5%). Forty-one (51.2%) patients underwent re-do AVR, 39 (48.8%) re-do complex aortic valve surgery (28 root, 23 ascending aorta and 6 hemiarch procedures) and 37.5% concomitant procedures. A bioprosthesis was implanted in 43.8%, a mechanical valve in 37.5%, a composite graft in 2.5%, a Biovalsalva graft in 6.2% and a homograft in 10% of patients. In-hospital mortality was 3.8% and incidence of major complications was low. CONCLUSIONS: A significant proportion of patients were young (61%<60 y), required complex aortic procedures (49%) or presented with contraindications for TAVR (mechanical valve, AR, IE, proximal aortic disease, need for concomitant surgery). Re-do aortic surgery remains the only treatment for such challenging cases and can be performed with acceptable mortality and morbidity in a specialised aortic centre.  
Impact of preinterventional tricuspid regurgitation on outcome of MitraClip therapy in patients with severely reduced ejection fraction.  ;AIM: To evaluate the impact of preinterventional moderate-to-severe functional tricuspid regurgitation (FTR) on early outcome after percutaneous edge-to-edge mitral valve repair (pMVR) with MitraClip procedures for functional mitral regurgitation (FMR) in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). METHODS AND RESULTS: From January 2013 to December 2017, 80 patients with HFrEF (ejection fraction 22%±5.3%) and FMR (grade 3.0±0.36) underwent successful pMVR. The 3-year actuarial survival was 58%. However, 73% (n=22) of non-survivors died of cardiac failure within 1 year. Patients were categorised into none-to-mild (n=36) and moderate-to-severe (n=44) postinterventional FTR groups according to pre-MitraClip tricuspid regurgitation grade. Cox regression analysis on 1-year survival demonstrated an impact of FTR severity (HR=1.8, 95% CI 1.01% to 3.09%, p=0.047), preoperative New York Heart Association class (HR=2.8, 95% CI 1.2% to 6.5%, p=0.015) and peripheral artery disease (HR=5.4, 95% CI 1.6 to 18, p=0.0054). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that 1-year cardiac death was higher in the moderate-to-severe FTR group (p=0.048). In our study, 77% of pre-MitraClip moderate-to-severe FTR cannot be significantly reduced. Post-MitraClip moderate-to-severe FTR grade was related to lower survival (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: In patients with HFrEF treated with MitraClip for FMR, moderate-to-severe FTR was an independent predictor of cardiac death within 1 year. To improve survival, additional therapy to residual FTR should be considered in early phase after MitraClip therapy.  
Cardiovascular magnetic resonance T2* mapping for the assessment of cardiovascular events in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  ;BACKGROUND: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is associated with an increased risk of adverse cardiac events. Beyond classic risk factors, relative myocardial ischaemia and succeeding myocardial alterations, which can be detected using either contrast agents or parametric mapping in cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging, have shown an impact on outcome in HCM. CMR may help to risk stratify using parametric T2* mapping. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the association of T2* values or fibrosis with cardiovascular events in HCM. METHODS: The relationship between T2* with supraventricular, ventricular arrhythmia or heart failure was retrospectively assessed in 91 patients with HCM referred for CMR on a 1.5T MR imaging system. Fibrosis as a reference was added to the model. Patients were subdivided into groups according to T2* value quartiles. RESULTS: 47 patients experienced an event of ventricular arrhythmia, 25 of atrial fibrillation/flutter and 17 of heart failure. T2*≤28.7 ms yielded no association with ventricular events in the whole HCM cohort. T2* of non-obstructive HCM showed a significant association with ventricular events in univariate analysis, but not in multivariate analysis. For the combined endpoint of arrhythmic events, there was already an association for the whole HCM cohort, but again only in univariate analyses. Fibrosis stayed the strongest predictor in all analyses. There was no association for T2* and fibrosis with heart failure. CONCLUSIONS: Decreased T2* values by CMR only provide a small association with arrhythmic events in HCM, especially in non-obstructive HCM. No information is added for heart failure.  
Transcatheter aortic valve replacement in patients with severe aortic stenosis and active cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.  ;"BACKGROUND: Patients with severe aortic stenosis and concomitant active cancer (AC) are considered high-risk patients and usually are not allowed to undergo surgical valve replacement. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) may be an attractive option for them; however, little is known about the outcomes of TAVR in this subset of complex patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this meta-analysis, Medline, Cochrane Library and Scopus databases were searched (anytime up to April 2019) for studies evaluating the outcomes of TAVR in patients with or without AC. We assessed pooled estimates (with their 95% CIs) of the risk ratio (RR) for the all-cause mortality at the 30-day and 1-year follow-ups, a 4-point safety outcome (any bleeding, stroke, need for a pacemaker and acute kidney injury) and a 2-point efficacy outcome (device success and residual mean gradient (mean difference)). Three studies (5162 patients) were included. Of those patients, a total of 368 (7.1%) had AC. Apart from a significantly higher need for a postprocedural pacemaker (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.58, p=0.01), TAVR in patients with AC resulted in similar outcomes for safety and efficacy at the 30-day follow-up compared with those without AC. Patients with AC experienced similar rates of the all-cause mortality at the 30-day follow-up compared with those without (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.59, p=0.76); however, the all-cause mortality was significantly higher in patients with AC at the 1-year follow-up (RR 1.71, 95% CI 1.26 to 2.33, p=0.0006). This mortality difference was independent of cancer stage (advanced or limited) at the 30-day follow-up but not at the 1-year follow-up; only patients with limited cancer stages showed similar all-cause mortality rates compared with those without cancer at the 1-year follow-up (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.91, p=0.37). CONCLUSION: TAVR in patients with AC is associated with similar 30-day and potentially worse 1-year outcomes compared with those in patients without AC. The 1-year all-cause mortality appears to be dependent on the cancer stage. Involving a specialised oncologist who usually considers cancer stage in the decision-making process and applying additional preoperative scores such as frailty indices might refine the risk assessment process among these patients.

Aortic stenosis in women.  ;Aortic stenosis (AS) is a common valve disorder in an ageing population in western countries, and women, with longer life expectancy, comprise a substantial percentage of elderly patients with AS. Compared with men, women exhibit distinctive characteristics at the level of stenotic valve leaflets and subsequent compensatory responses of the left ventricle to chronic pressure overload, and in clinical presentation, consequences and response to intervention. Randomised controlled trials of transcatheter aortic valve implantation have yielded new evidence of sex differences in both short-term and long-term outcomes after intervention. A comprehensive knowledge of the existing evidence may inform our understanding of gender differences during assessment and treatment of patients with AS. In this paper, we review the available evidence regarding sex differences in AS in terms of symptoms, clinical presentation, anatomical differences and pathophysiological progression, management and outcomes after aortic valve replacement. Implications for further research are suggested.  
Floppy mitral valve/mitral valve prolapse: A complex entity with multiple genotypes and phenotypes.  ;Floppy mitral valve/mitral valve prolapse (FMV/MVP) is a common valvular abnormality affecting 2% to 3% of the general population. It occurs in a heterogeneous group of patients with varying and age dependent expressions. FMV/MVP can be familial or sporadic, isolated (called non-syndromic) or as a part of a well-defined syndrome of heritable connective tissue disorders or other diseases. A wide range of phenotypic expression exists ranging from asymptomatic to non-specific symptoms related to neuroendocrine or autonomic nervous system functional abnormalities, varying degrees of mitral regurgitation that may require interventional therapy, heart failure, infective endocarditis, cardiac arrhythmias and/or sudden cardiac death. FMV/MVP is predominantly considered a heritable disorder with clinical manifestations not present at birth, but appearing later in life. Though a variant gene may initiate the development of FMV/MVP, precise phenotypic expression may be related to multiple other molecular, genetic and epigenetic factors that modify the final expression of the disease. A better understanding of these mechanisms will help to better define the natural history of the disease, inhibit disease progression and even prevent the phenotypic expression of FMV/MVP.  
Speckle tracking echocardiography as a new diagnostic tool for an assessment of cardiovascular disease in rheumatic patients.  ;Chronic inflammation represents the cornerstone of the raised cardiovascular (CV) risk in patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases (IRD). Standardized mortality ratios are increased in these patients compared to the general population, which can be explained by premature mortality associated with early atherosclerotic events. Thus, IRD patients need appropriate CV risk management in view of this CV disease (CVD) burden. Currently, optimal CV risk management is still lacking in usual care, and early diagnosis of silent and subclinical CVD involvement is mandatory to improve the long-term prognosis of those patients. Although CV involvement in such patients is highly heterogeneous and may affect various structures of the heart, it can now be diagnosed earlier and promptly treated. CV imaging provides valuable information as a reliable diagnostic tool. Currently, different techniques are employed to evaluate CV risk, including transthoracic or trans-esophageal echocardiography, magnetic resonance imaging, or computed tomography, to investigate valve abnormalities, pericardial disease, and ventricular wall motion defects. All the above methods are reliable in investigating CV involvement, but more recently, Speckle Tracking Echocardiography (STE) has been suggested to be diagnostically more accurate. In recent years, the role of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) as the gold standard parameter for the evaluation of systolic function has been debated, and many efforts have been focused on the clinical validation of new non-invasive tools for the study of myocardial contractility as well as to characterize the subclinical alterations of the myocardial function. Improvement in the accuracy of STE has resulted in a large amount of research showing the ability of STE to overcome LVEF limitations in the majority of primary and secondary heart diseases. This review summarizes the additional value that STE measurement can provide in the setting of IRD, with a focus in the different clinical stages.

Effects of Frailty on Outcomes and 30-day Readmissions After Surgical Mitral Valve Replacement.  ;"BACKGROUND: Frailty is increasingly recognized as an important prognostic marker in surgical populations. The effects of frailty on outcomes after mitral valve replacement (MVR) is less clear given the inherent complexity of this patient population. We evaluated the influences of frailty on outcomes and readmission rates after MVR. METHODS: Adult patients undergoing isolated MVR were queried from the National Readmissions Database from 2010 to 2014. Frailty was defined using the Johns Hopkins Adjusted Clinical Groups frailty-defining diagnoses indicator, a validated instrument developed for use in health administrative data. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine hospital- and patient-level risk factors for readmission, postoperative complications, and death. RESULTS: Among 50,410 patients who underwent MVR, 7.9% met frailty criteria. Frail patients were more likely to be older, have nonprivate insurance, an index admission from the emergency department, and teaching hospital care (all P < .001). Frail patients had significantly more postoperative complications (77% vs 47%, P < .001), more discharges to a facility (50% vs 21%, P < .001), and higher in-hospital mortality (12% vs 4%, P < .001). Index hospitalization costs were almost doubled in frail patients, and of those who survived to discharge, 30-day readmissions were more frequent (28% vs 20%, P < .001). Frailty independently increased the risk of index hospitalization composite complications (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 3.28; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.61-4.12), in-hospital mortality (AOR, 2.35; 95% CI, 1.90-2.92), and 30-day readmission (AOR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.20-1.78). CONCLUSIONS: Frailty is an independent predictor of morbidity, death, and increased costs after MVR. Frailty metrics should be increasingly understood among patients requiring mitral valve intervention as percutaneous approaches for intervention become increasingly used.  "

Prognostic role of moderate functional tricuspid regurgitation in length of hospitalization in patients undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass grafting.  ;Functional tricuspid regurgitation (FTR) is defined as abnormal systolic tricuspid leakage with normal valve structures, and its prognostic role and management in patients with left-heart valve disease is well known. Due to paucity of data on FTR in patients with ischemic heart disease, the aim of our prospective study was to compare the prognostic effect of FTR between patients with moderate FTR and those with less-than-moderate FTR undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. This prospective cohort study included all the patients who were candidate for isolated CABG and were referred for preoperative transthoracic echocardiography between April 2018 and November 2018. Patients were categorized into two groups: less-than-moderate FTR and moderate FTR. The endpoints of the study were the prognostic effect of FTR on short-term mortality and morbidities as a composite endpoint, as well as length of hospitalization, length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and ventilation time. Of a total of 410 patients, 363 patients (mean age = 62.4 years, 63.7% men) entered our final analysis. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that composite endpoints of short-term mortality and morbidities was not significantly different between the two groups, but moderate FTR had a statistically significant effect on length of hospitalization (P = 0.002) and the ventilation time (P = 0.048). This effect, however, did not persist after adjustments for probable known confounders. Our study indicated no significant prognostic effect for preoperative FTR versus less-than-moderate FTR on short-term mortality and morbidities, as well as length of hospitalization, length of ICU stay, and the ventilation time.

Papillary Muscle Heads Focalization for Functional Mitral Valve Regurgitation.  ;Mitral valve annuloplasty has been the gold standard for treatment of functional mitral valve regurgitation. However, annuloplasty for functional mitral regurgitation may cause augmented posterior leaflet tethering, which results in functional anterior prolapse. Herein we added papillary muscle heads focalization for such patients. All separated papillary muscle heads are sutured together, and the roots of chordae at each papillary muscle are unifocalized on both sides. Stitches are positioned at the same distances from corresponding leaflet edges to adjust the height of leaflet edges in each segment. This is a simple and effective technique to correct for functional anterior prolapse after annuloplasty.

Three-Dimensional Modeling of Surgically Implanted Stent-Based Valves in the Mitral Position in Children.  ;PURPOSE: In children with a mitral annulus too small to accommodate traditional prostheses, surgical implantation of stent-based valves is a promising option. However no reliable preoperative methods exist to guide patient selection, device sizing, and positioning. We describe a novel methodology to visualize and quantify device fit in 3-dimensional echocardiogram (3DE)-derived heart models. DESCRIPTION: Heart models were created from existing preoperative 3DEs using custom software. Valve models were virtually implanted into the models, and both device fit and left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) area were quantified. EVALUATION: The 3DEs of 3 patients who underwent Melody valve placement in the mitral position were retrospectively modeled: 1 with LVOT obstruction, 1 with perivalvar leak, and 1 without complications. In all cases 2-dimensional measurements underestimated 3D annular dimensions, and the patient with clinical LVOT obstruction had the lowest predicted LVOT area-to-aortic area ratio (0.5). CONCLUSIONS: 3DE-based preoperative modeling of surgical implantation of stent-based valves in the mitral position may improve quantification of mitral valve dimensions and inform risk stratification for potential LVOT obstruction.  
Should Moderate Functional Tricuspid Regurgitation Be Repaired During Surgery for Rheumatic Mitral Valve Disease?  ;"BACKGROUND: Surgical repair of concomitant functional moderate tricuspid valve (TV) regurgitation at the time of mitral valve (MV) surgery remains controversial. AIM: The objective of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of concomitant repair of functional moderate tricuspid regurgitation (TR) during MV surgery for rheumatic valve disease. METHOD: From 1998 to 2016, 1,240 patients had rheumatic MV disease associated with moderate functional TR: 974 patients had MV surgery and concomitant TV repair (group 1) and 266 patients had MV surgery alone (group 2). Study endpoints were operative outcomes, rehospitalisation for congestive heart failure (CHF), and TV reintervention. Propensity score matching identified 192 well-matched pairs for outcomes comparison. RESULTS: Patients who had concomitant TV repair were younger (p=0.02) and there were fewer diabetics (p=0.015). In matched patients, low cardiac output was significantly higher in group 2 (p=0.044) and there was no difference in ventilation time, intensive care unit stay, cardiopulmonary bypass, and ischaemic times (p=0.480, p=0.797, p=0.232, and p=0.550, respectively) between groups. Patients in group 2 required more TV reintervention (1 vs 35 in group 1 and 2, respectively; p=0.004) and rehospitalisation for CHF (5 vs 40 in group 1 and 2, respectively; p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Concomitant TV repair for moderate TR in patients undergoing rheumatic MV surgery was not associated with increased operative risk. Postoperative low cardiac output syndrome and the risk of late TV reinterventions and rehospitalisation for CHF were lower with TV repair. Concomitant repair of the moderate TV regurgitation maybe beneficial for patients undergoing rheumatic MV surgery.  "
Surgical treatment and long-term outcome of aortic valve endocarditis with periannular abscess.  ;OBJECTIVES: Aortic valve endocarditis is occasionally complicated by periannular spreading of the infection and abscess formation, leading to a more aggressive course of the disease and life-threatening complications. This retrospective observational study investigated the long-term outcomes of patients with this complication, which was surgically managed with annular reconstruction and aortic valve replacement. METHODS: Between 1998 and 2018, 69 patients were identified with aortic valve endocarditis complicated by periannular abscess formation. All patients were treated with debridement of the infected tissue, gentamicin filling of abscess cavities, annulus reconstruction with bovine pericardium, and valve replacement. Long-term follow-up was performed to detect the rate of recurrence of endocarditis, aortic valve reoperation and survival. RESULTS: Mean age was 58 ± 15 years, 81% of patients were male, and the infected valve was native in 51% of all patients. The overall mortality was 36%, with a 30-day mortality of 13% and 120-day mortality of 16%. Five- and 10-year survival was 69.4 ± 12.0% and 55.7 ± 14.3%, respectively. Ten-year freedom from recurrent endocarditis was 83.5 ± 13.3%. CONCLUSION: Endocarditis with annular abscess remains associated with high morbidity and mortality and aggressive treatment of the infected tissue and abscess cavities is crucial. Compared with earlier literature, long-term outcome of annular reconstruction in this series is comparable to that of aortic root replacement.

The cryo-EM structure of the SNX-BAR Mvp1 tetramer.  ;Sorting nexins (SNX) are a family of PX domain-containing proteins with pivotal roles in trafficking and signaling. SNX-BARs, which also have a curvature-generating Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) domain, have membrane-remodeling functions, particularly at the endosome. The minimal PX-BAR module is a dimer mediated by BAR-BAR interactions. Many SNX-BAR proteins, however, additionally have low-complexity N-terminal regions of unknown function. Here, we present the cryo-EM structure of the full-length SNX-BAR Mvp1, which is an autoinhibited tetramer. The tetramer is a dimer of dimers, wherein the membrane-interacting BAR surfaces are sequestered and the PX lipid-binding sites are occluded. The N-terminal low-complexity region of Mvp1 is essential for tetramerization. Mvp1 lacking its N-terminus is dimeric and exhibits enhanced membrane association. Membrane binding and remodeling by Mvp1 therefore requires unmasking of the PX and BAR domain lipid-interacting surfaces. This work reveals a tetrameric configuration of a SNX-BAR protein that provides critical insight into SNX-BAR function and regulation.  
Aortic valve calcification in the era of non-coding RNAs: The revolution to come in aortic stenosis management?  ;Aortic valve stenosis remains the most frequent structural heart disease, especially in the elderly. During the last decade, we noticed an important consideration and a huge number of publications related to the medical and surgical treatment of this disease. However, the molecular aspect of this degenerative issue has also been more widely studied recently. As evidenced in oncologic but also cardiac research fields, the emergence of microRNAs in the molecular screening and follow-up makes them potential biomarkers in the future, for the diagnosis, follow-up and treatment of aortic stenosis. Herein, we present a review on the implication of microRNAs in the aortic valve disease management. After listing and describing the main miRNAs of interest in the field, we provide an outline to develop miRNAs as innovative biomarkers and innovative therapeutic strategies, and describe a groundbreaking pre-clinical study using inhibitors of miR-34a in a pre-clinical model of aortic valve stenosis.  
Health Status Changes and Outcomes in Patients With Heart Failure and Mitral Regurgitation: COAPT Trial.  ;"BACKGROUND: In the COAPT (Cardiovascular Outcomes Assessment of the MitraClip Percutaneous Therapy for Heart Failure Patients With Functional Mitral Regurgitation) trial, transcatheter mitral valve repair (TMVr) with the MitraClip rapidly improved health status and reduced the long-term risks for death and heart failure (HF) hospitalization in patients with HF and severe secondary mitral regurgitation who remained symptomatic despite maximally tolerated guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT). OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to examine if early health status changes were associated with long-term clinical outcomes in the COAPT population. METHODS: The association between change in health status (Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire overall summary score [KCCQ-OS]) from baseline to 1 month and the composite rate of death or HF hospitalization between 1 month and 2 years in the COAPT trial were evaluated, and whether treatment (TMVr or GDMT alone) modified this association was tested. RESULTS: Among 551 patients with HF and severe secondary mitral regurgitation who were alive at 1 month, those randomized to TMVr were more likely than those randomized to GDMT alone to achieve a ≥10-point improvement in KCCQ-OS from baseline to 1 month (TMVr, 58%; GDMT alone, 26%). Early improvement in KCCQ-OS was inversely associated with the risk for death or HF hospitalization between 1 month and 2 years (p < 0.001). When analyzed as a continuous variable, a 10-point increase in KCCQ-OS was associated with a 14% lower risk for death or HF hospitalization (hazard ratio: 0.86; 95% confidence interval: 0.81 to 0.92; p < 0.001), with no significant interaction with treatment group (pinteraction = 0.17). After adjusting for demographic and clinical factors, the association between change in KCCQ-OS and outcomes was strengthened (hazard ratio: 0.79; 95% confidence interval: 0.73 to 0.86; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with HF and severe secondary mitral regurgitation, a short-term change in disease-specific health status was strongly associated with the subsequent long-term risk for death or HF hospitalization. These findings reinforce the prognostic utility of serial KCCQ-OS assessments to identify patients at risk for poor long-term clinical outcomes in this population.

Deep sedation as temporary bridge to definitive treatment of ventricular arrhythmia storm.  ;BACKGROUND: Electrical storm and incessant ventricular tachycardia (VT) are characterized by the clustering of episodes of VT or ventricular fibrillation (VF) and are associated with a poor prognosis. Autonomic nervous system activity influences VT threshold, and deep sedation may be useful for the treatment of VT emergencies. METHODS: We reviewed data from conscious patients admitted to our intensive care unit (ICU) due to monomorphic VT, polymorphic VT or VF at our tertiary center between 2010 and 2018. RESULTS: A total of 46 conscious patients with recurrent ventricular arrhythmia, refractory to initial treatment, were referred to the ICU. The majority (n = 31) were stabilized on usual care. The remaining treatment-refractory 15 patients (57 years (range 9-74), 80% males, seven with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators) with VT/VF storm (n = 11) or incessant VT (n = 4) due to ischemic heart disease (n = 10), cardiomyopathy (n = 2), primary arrhythmia (n = 2) and one patient post valve surgery, were deeply sedated and intubated. A complete resolution of VT/VF within minutes to hours was achieved in 12 patients (80%), partial resolution in two (13%) and one (7%) patient died due to ventricular free-wall rupture. One patient with recurrent VT episodes needing repeated deep sedation developed necrotic caecum. No other major complications were seen. Thirteen (87%) patients were alive after a mean follow-up of 3.7 years. CONCLUSION: Deep sedation was effective and safe for the temporary management of malignant VT/VF refractory to usual treatment. In emergencies, deep sedation may be widely accessible at both secondary and tertiary centers and a clinically useful bridge to definitive treatment of VT.  
Baseline frailty status and outcomes important for shared decision-making in older adults receiving transcatheter aortic valve implantation, a prospective observational study.  ;AIMS: The objective of this study was to examine baseline frailty status (including cognitive deficits) and important clinical outcomes, to inform shared decision-making in older adults receiving transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted a prospective, observational study of 82 TAVI patients, recruited 2013 to 2015, with 2-year follow-up. Mean age was 83 years (standard deviation (SD) 4.7). Eighteen percent of the patients were frail, as assessed with an 8-item frailty scale. Fifteen patients (18%) had a Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) score below 24 points at baseline, indicating cognitive impairment or dementia and five patients had an MMSE below 20 points. Mean New York Heart Association (NYHA) class at baseline and 6 months was 2.5 (SD 0.6) and 1.4 (SD 0.6), (p < 0.001). There was no change in mean Nottingham Extended Activities of Daily Living (NEADL) scale between baseline and 6 months, 54.2 (SD 11.5) and 54.5 (SD 10.3) points, respectively, mean difference 0.3 (p = 0.7). At 2 years, six patients (7%) had died, four (5%, n = 79) lived in a nursing home, four (5%) suffered from disabling stroke, and six (7%) contracted infective endocarditis. CONCLUSIONS: TAVI patients had improvement in symptoms and maintenance of activity of daily living at 6 months. They had low mortality and most patients lived in their own home 2 years after TAVI. Complications like death, stroke, and endocarditis occurred. Some patients had cognitive impairment before the procedure which might influence decision-making. Our findings may be used to develop pre-TAVI decision aids.

Clinical outcomes after cardiac rehabilitation in elderly patients with and without diabetes mellitus: The EU-CaRE multicenter cohort study.  ;"BACKGROUND: The prevalence of patients with concomitant cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus (DM) is increasing rapidly. We aimed to compare the effectiveness of current cardiac rehabilitation (CR) programs across seven European countries between elderly cardiac patients with and without DM. METHODS: 1633 acute and chronic coronary artery disease (CAD) patients and patients after valve intervention with an age 65 or above who participated in comprehensive CR (3 weeks to 3 months, depending on centre) were included. Peak oxygen uptake (VO2 peak), body mass index, resting systolic blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) were assessed before start of CR, at termination of CR (variable time point), and 12 months after start of CR, with no intervention after CR. Baseline values and changes from baseline to 12-month follow-up were compared between patients with and without DM using mixed models, and mortality and hospitalisation rates using logistic regression. RESULTS: 430 (26.3%) patients had DM. Patients with DM had more body fat, lower educational level, more comorbidities, cardiovascular risk factors, and more advanced CAD. Both groups increased their VO2 peak over the study period but with a significantly lower improvement from baseline to follow-up in patients with DM. In the DM group, change in HbA1c was associated with weight change but not with change in absolute VO2 peak. 12-month cardiac mortality was higher in patients with DM. CONCLUSIONS: While immediate improvements in VO2 peak after CR in elderly patients with and without DM were similar, 12-month maintenance of this improvement was inferior in patients with DM, possibly related to disease progression. Glycemic control was less favourable in diabetic patients needing insulin in the short- and long-term. Since glycemic control was only related to weight loss but not to increase in exercise capacity, this highlights the importance of weight loss in obese DM patients during CR.

Selecting interventions to improve patient-relevant outcomes in health care for aortic valve disease - the Intervention Selection Toolbox.  ;BACKGROUND: Measuring and improving outcomes is a central element of value-based health care. However, selecting improvement interventions based on outcome measures is complex and tools to support the selection process are lacking. The goal was to present strategies for the systematic identification and selection of improvement interventions applied to the case of aortic valve disease and to combine various methods of process and outcome assessment into one integrated approach for quality improvement. METHODS: For this case study a concept-driven mixed-method approach was applied for the identification of improvement intervention clusters including: (1) benchmarking outcomes, (2) data exploration, (3) care delivery process analysis, and (4) monitoring of ongoing improvements. The main outcome measures were long-term survival and 30-day mortality. For the selection of an improvement intervention, the causal relations between the potential improvement interventions and outcome measures were quantified followed by a team selection based on consensus from a multidisciplinary team of professionals. RESULTS: The study resulted in a toolbox: the Intervention Selection Toolbox (IST). The toolbox comprises two phases: (a) identifying potential for improvement, and (b) selecting an effective intervention from the four clusters expected to lead to the desired improvement in outcomes. The improvements identified for the case of aortic valve disease with impact on long-term survival in the context of the studied hospital in 2015 include: anticoagulation policy, increased attention to nutritional status of patients and determining frailty of patients before the treatment decision. CONCLUSIONS: Identifying potential for improvement and carefully selecting improvement interventions based on (clinical) outcome data demands a multifaceted approach. Our toolbox integrates both care delivery process analyses and outcome analyses. The toolbox is recommended for use in hospital care for the selection of high-impact improvement interventions.  
The improvement of the shear stress and oscillatory shear index of coronary arteries during Enhanced External Counterpulsation in patients with coronary heart disease.  ;BACKGROUND: Enhanced External Counterpulsation (EECP) can chronically relieve ischemic chest pain and improve the prognosis of coronary heart disease (CHD). Despite its role in mitigating heart complications, EECP and the mechanisms behind its therapeutic nature, such as its effects on blood flow hemodynamics, are still not fully understood. This study aims to elucidate the effect of EECP on significant hemodynamic parameters in the coronary arterial tree. METHODS: A finite volume method was used in conjunction with the inlet pressure wave (surrogated by the measured aortic pressure) before and during EECP and outlet flow resistance, assuming the blood as newtonian fluid. The time-average wall shear stress (TAWSS) and oscillatory shear index (OSI) were determined from the flow field. RESULTS: Regardless of the degree of vascular stenosis, hemodynamic conditions and flow patterns could be improved during EECP. In comparison with the original tree, the tree with a severe stenosis (75% area stenosis) demonstrated more significant improvement in hemodynamic conditions and flow patterns during EECP, with surface area ratio of TAWSS risk area (SAR-TAWSS) reduced from 12.3% to 6.7% (vs. SAR-TAWSS reduced from 7.2% to 5.6% in the original tree) and surface area ratio of OSI risk area (SAR-OSI) reduced from 6.8% to 2.5% (vs. SAR-OSI of both 0% before and during EECP in the original tree because of mild stenosis). Moreover, it was also shown that small ratio of diastolic pressure (D) and systolic pressure (S) (D/S) could only improve the hemodynamic condition mildly. The SAR-TAWSS reduction ratio significantly increased as D/S became larger. CONCLUSIONS: A key finding of the study was that the improvement of hemodynamic conditions along the LMCA trees during EECP became more significant with the increase of D/S and the severity degree of stenoses at the bifurcation site. These findings have important implications on EECP as adjuvant therapy before or after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients with diffuse atherosclerosis.  
TAVR outcome after reclassification of aortic valve stenosis by using a hybrid continuity equation that combines computed tomography and echocardiography data.  ;BACKGROUND: In the continuity equation, assumption of a round-shaped left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) leads to underestimation of the true aortic valve area in two-dimensional echocardiography. The current study evaluated whether inclusion of the LVOT area, as measured by computed tomography (CT), reclassifies the degree of aortic stenosis (AS) and assessed the impact on patient outcome after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). METHODS AND RESULTS: Four hundred and twenty-two patients with indexed aortic valve area index (AVAi) of <0.6 cm2 /m2 , assessed by using the classical continuity equation (mean age: 81.5 ± 6.1 years, 51% female, mean left ventricular ejection fraction: 53.2 ± 13.6%), underwent TAVR and were included. After inclusion of the CT measured LVOT area into the continuity equation, the hybrid AVAi led to a reclassification of 30% (n = 128) of patients from severe to moderate AS. Multivariate predictors for reclassification were male sex, lower mean aortic gradient, and lower annulus/LVOT ratio (all p < .01). Reclassified patients had significantly higher sST2 at baseline and higher NT-proBNP values at baseline and 6 months follow-up compared to non-reclassified patients. Acute kidney injury was experienced more frequently after TAVR by reclassified patients, but no significant mortality difference occurred during 2 years of follow-up. CONCLUSION: The hybrid AVAi reclassifies a significant portion of low-gradient severe AS patients into moderate AS. Reclassified patients showed increased fibrosis and heart failure markers at baseline compared to non-reclassified patients. But reclassification had no significant impact on mortality up to 2 years after TAVR. Routine assessment of hybrid AVAi seems not to improve further risk stratification of TAVR patients.  
Curcumin inhibits calcification of human aortic valve interstitial cells by interfering NF-κB, AKT, and ERK pathways.  ;The osteogenic differentiation of human aortic valve interstitial cells (hVICs) is the key cellular mechanism of calcified aortic valve disease (CAVD). This study aimed to explore how curcumin (CCM) inhibits the osteogenic differentiation of hVICs and elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved. In this study, CCM inhibited the osteogenic differentiation of hVICs under osteogenic medium (OM) conditions by reversing the OM-induced increase in calcified nodule formation and osteogenesis-specific markers (ALP and Runx2). RNA sequencing identified 475 common differentially expressed genes with Venn diagrams of the different groups. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment revealed that the CCM inhibition of hVIC osteogenic differentiation was enriched in the NF-κB, PI3K-AKT, TNF, Jak-STAT, and MAPK signaling pathways. In addition, CCM suppressed the phosphorylation of ERK, IκBα, AKT, and interfered with the translocation of P65 into the cell nucleus in hVICs under OM culture conditions. In conclusion, CCM inhibited the osteogenic differentiation of hVICs via interfering with the activation of NF-κB/AKT/ERK signaling pathways. Our findings provide novel insights into a critical role for CCM in CAVD progression and shed new light on CCM-directed therapeutics for CAVD.  
Preoperative frailty parameters as predictors for outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve implantation: a systematic review and meta-analysis.  ;Guidelines suggest using frailty characteristics in the work-up for a transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). There are many frailty-screening tools with different components. The prognostic value of the individual parameters in frailty is as yet unclear. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to find and pool predictors for 1‑year mortality after TAVI. We followed a two-step approach. First, we searched for randomised controlled trials on TAVI to identify frailty parameters used in these studies. Second, we searched for publications on these frailty parameters. Articles were included for pooled analysis if the studied frailty parameters were dichotomised with clear cut-off values based on common standards or clinical practice and reported adjusted hazard ratios (HR) of 1‑year mortality after TAVI. We calculated pooled effect estimates of 49 studies based on dichotomised frailty scores (HR: 2.16, 95% CI: 1.57-3.00), chronic lung disease (HR: 1.57, 95% CI: 1.45-1.70), estimated glomerular filtration rate <30 ml/min (HR: 1.95, 95% CI: 1.68-2.29), body mass index <20 kg/m2 (HR: 1.49, 95% CI: 1.09-2.03), hypoalbuminaemia (HR: 1.77, 95% CI: 1.38-2.25), anaemia (HR: 2.08, 95% CI: 0.93-4.66), low gait speed (HR: 13.33, 95% CI: 1.75-101.49) and Katz activities of daily living (ADL) score of 1 or more deficits (HR: 5.16, 95% CI: 0.77-34.47). Chronic lung disease, chronic kidney disease, underweight, hypoalbuminaemia, a low frailty score, anaemia, low gait speed and an ADL deficiency were associated with worse 1‑year outcomes after TAVI.  
A Role for MMP-10 (Matrix Metalloproteinase-10) in Calcific Aortic Valve Stenosis.  ;"OBJECTIVE: Aortic valve (AV) calcification plays an important role in the progression of aortic stenosis (AS). MMP-10 (matrix metalloproteinase-10 or stromelysin-2) is involved in vascular calcification in atherosclerosis. We hypothesize that MMP-10 may play a pathophysiological role in calcific AS. Approach and Results: Blood samples (n=112 AS and n=349 controls) and AVs (n=88) from patients undergoing valve replacement were analyzed. Circulating MMP-10 was higher in patients with AS compared with controls (P<0.001) and correlated with TNFα (tumor necrosis factor α; rS=0.451; P<0.0001). MMP-10 was detected by immunochemistry in AVs from patients with AS colocalized with aortic valve interstitial cells markers α-SMA (α-smooth muscle actin) and vimentin and with calcification markers Runx2 (Runt-related transcription factor 2) and SRY (sex-determining region Y)-box 9. MMP-10 expression in AVs was further confirmed by RT-qPCR and western blot. Ex vivo, MMP-10 was elevated in the conditioned media of AVs from patients with AS and associated with interleukin-1β (rS=0.5045, P<0.001) and BMP (bone morphogenetic protein)-2 (rS=0.5003, P<0.01). In vitro, recombinant human MMP-10 induced the overexpression of inflammatory, fibrotic, and osteogenic markers (interleukin-1β, α-SMA, vimentin, collagen, BMP-4, Sox9, OPN [osteopontin], BMP-9, and Smad 1/5/8; P<0.05) and cell mineralization in aortic valve interstitial cells isolated from human AVs, in a mechanism involving Akt (protein kinase B) phosphorylation. These effects were prevented by TIMP-1 (tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases type 1), a physiological MMP inhibitor, or specifically by an anti-MMP-10 antibody. CONCLUSIONS: MMP-10, which is overexpressed in aortic valve from patients with AS, seems to play a central role in calcification in AS through Akt phosphorylation. MMP-10 could be a new therapeutic target for delaying the progression of aortic valve calcification in AS.  "
Age over 35 years is associated with increased mortality after pulmonary valve replacement in repaired tetralogy of Fallot: results from the UK National Congenital Heart Disease Audit database.  ;OBJECTIVES: Many adults with repaired tetralogy of Fallot will require a pulmonary valve replacement (PVR), but there is no consensus on the best timing. In this study, we aim to evaluate the impact of age at PVR on outcomes. METHODS: This is a national multicentre retrospective study including all patients >15 years of age with repaired tetralogy of Fallot who underwent their first PVR between 2000 and 2013. The optimal age cut-off was identified using Cox regression and classification and regression tree analysis. RESULTS: A total of 707 patients were included, median age 26 (15-72) years. The mortality rate at 10 years after PVR was 4.2%, and the second PVR rate of 6.8%. Age at PVR of 35 years was identified as the optimal cut-off in relation to late mortality. Patients above 35 years of age had a 5.6 fold risk of death at 10 years compared with those with PVR under 35 years (10.4% vs 1.3%, P < 0.001), more concomitant tricuspid valve repair/replacement (15.1% vs 5.7%, P < 0.001) and surgical arrhythmia treatment (18.4% vs 5.9%, P < 0.001). In those under 50 years, there was an 8.7 fold risk of late death compared with the general population, higher for those with PVR after 35 than those with PVR below 35 years (hazard ratio 9.9 vs 7.4). CONCLUSIONS: Patients above 35 years of age with repaired tetralogy of Fallot have significantly worse mortality after PVR, compared with younger patients and a higher burden of mortality relative to the general population. This suggests that there are still cases where the timing of initial PVR is not optimal, warranting a re-evaluation of criteria for intervention.  
Rational and design of the ROTAS study: a randomized study for the optimal treatment of symptomatic patients with low-gradient severe aortic valve stenosis and preserved left ventricular ejection fraction.  ;AIMS: Fifteen to thirty percentage of patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) have preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and a discordant AS pattern at Doppler echocardiography, which is characterized by a small (<1 cm2) aortic area and low mean aortic gradient (<40 mmHg). The 'Randomized study for the Optimal Treatment of symptomatic patients with low-gradient severe Aortic Stenosis and preserved left ventricular ejection fraction' (ROTAS trial) aims at demonstrating the superiority of aortic valve replacement vs. a 'watchful waiting strategy' in symptomatic patients with low-gradient (LS), severe AS, and preserved LVEF, stratified according to indexed stroke volume, in terms of all-cause mortality or cardiovascular-related hospitalization during follow-up (FU). METHODS AND RESULTS: The ROTAS trial will be a multicentre randomized non-blinded study involving 16 reference centres. AS severity will be confirmed by a multimodality approach (rest and stress echocardiography, calcium scoring, and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging for optimally characterize the population), which could provide important inputs to improve the pathophysiological understanding of this complex disease. Well-characterized patients will be randomized according to the management strategy. The primary endpoint will be the occurrence of all-cause mortality or cardiac related-hospitalizations during 2-year FU. One hundred and eighty subjects per group will be included. CONCLUSION: The management of patients with LS severe AS and preserved LVEF is largely debated. ROTAS trial will allow a comprehensive evaluation of this particular pattern of AS and will establish which is the most appropriate management of these patients.  
Left Bundle Branch Block: Current and Future Perspectives.  ;Left bundle branch block may be due to conduction system degeneration or a reflection of myocardial pathology. Left bundle branch block may also develop following aortic valve disease or cardiac procedures. Patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and left bundle branch block may respond positively to cardiac resynchronization therapy. Lead placement via the coronary sinus is the mainstay approach of cardiac resynchronization therapy. However, other options, including physiological pacing, are being explored. In this review, we summarize the salient pathophysiologic and clinical aspects of left bundle branch block, as well as current and future strategies for management.  
Association of FADS1/2 Locus Variants and Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids With Aortic Stenosis.  ;"IMPORTANCE: Aortic stenosis (AS) has no approved medical treatment. Identifying etiological pathways for AS could identify pharmacological targets. OBJECTIVE: To identify novel genetic loci and pathways associated with AS. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This genome-wide association study used a case-control design to evaluate 44 703 participants (3469 cases of AS) of self-reported European ancestry from the Genetic Epidemiology Research on Adult Health and Aging (GERA) cohort (from January 1, 1996, to December 31, 2015). Replication was performed in 7 other cohorts totaling 256 926 participants (5926 cases of AS), with additional analyses performed in 6942 participants from the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) Consortium. Follow-up biomarker analyses with aortic valve calcium (AVC) were also performed. Data were analyzed from May 1, 2017, to December 5, 2019. EXPOSURES: Genetic variants (615 643 variants) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω-6 and ω-3) measured in blood samples. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Aortic stenosis and aortic valve replacement defined by electronic health records, surgical records, or echocardiography and the presence of AVC measured by computed tomography. RESULTS: The mean (SD) age of the 44 703 GERA participants was 69.7 (8.4) years, and 22 019 (49.3%) were men. The rs174547 variant at the FADS1/2 locus was associated with AS (odds ratio [OR] per C allele, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.83-0.93; P = 3.0 × 10-6), with genome-wide significance after meta-analysis with 7 replication cohorts totaling 312 118 individuals (9395 cases of AS) (OR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.88-0.94; P = 2.5 × 10-8). A consistent association with AVC was also observed (OR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.83-0.99; P = .03). A higher ratio of arachidonic acid to linoleic acid was associated with AVC (OR per SD of the natural logarithm, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.09-1.30; P = 6.6 × 10-5). In mendelian randomization, increased FADS1 liver expression and arachidonic acid were associated with AS (OR per unit of normalized expression, 1.31 [95% CI, 1.17-1.48; P = 7.4 × 10-6]; OR per 5-percentage point increase in arachidonic acid for AVC, 1.23 [95% CI, 1.01-1.49; P = .04]; OR per 5-percentage point increase in arachidonic acid for AS, 1.08 [95% CI, 1.04-1.13; P = 4.1 × 10-4]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Variation at the FADS1/2 locus was associated with AS and AVC. Findings from biomarker measurements and mendelian randomization appear to link ω-6 fatty acid biosynthesis to AS, which may represent a therapeutic target.  "
Recurrent infective endocarditis versus first-time infective endocarditis after heart valve surgery.  ;OBJECTIVE: Infective endocarditis (IE) may require heart valve surgery. It is well known that heart valve surgery itself and previous IE predispose to IE. However, data are sparse on whether the risk of IE is different among patients undergoing valve surgery due to IE and other causes (i.e. recurrent vs. first-time IE). METHODS: Using Danish nationwide registries, patients undergoing left-sided heart valve surgery in the course of an IE hospitalization (1996-2017) were identified and matched with controls undergoing left-sided heart valve surgery due to another cause than IE in a 1:1 ratio. Patients were stratified according to type of surgical valve intervention and affected valve. The comparative risk of recurrent vs. first-time IE was assessed by cumulative incidence curves and multivariable Cox regression analyses. RESULTS: The study population comprised 971 patients with a first-time admission for IE requiring heart valve surgery matched with 971 controls undergoing heart valve surgery due to other causes than IE. The risk of recurrent IE was significantly higher than the risk of first-time IE following heart valve surgery (5.5% and 3.0% by 10 years, hazard ratio (HR) 1.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02-2.70). The risk of IE recurrence was not significantly different comparing valve replacement and valve repair (5.5% and 5.3%, respectively, HR 1.60, 95% CI 0.71-3.60). Yet, the risk of IE recurrence was significantly higher among patients with biological versus mechanical prostheses (6.3% and 4.6%, respectively, HR 2.00, 95% CI 1.02-3.70). CONCLUSIONS: Following heart valve surgery, the risk of recurrent IE was significantly higher than the risk of first-time IE.  
[Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy].  ;Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is the most common genetically determined cardiac disease with a prevalence of 0.2-0.6%. The most important pathophysiological phenomenon is dynamic obstruction predominantly of the left ventricular outflow tract in 70% of the patients. Clinical symptoms (e.g. dyspnea, angina pectoris and syncope) are extremely variable depending on changes in preload and afterload and an increased risk of sudden cardiac death particularly in younger patients. The diagnostic measures should be carried out with respect to a prognostic and symptomatic treatment with implantation of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) in cases of increased risk of sudden cardiac death. When medication treatment fails, first-line treatment consists of septal ablation and surgical myectomy as a supplementary measure, depending on the underlying morphology and experience of the surgeon.  
Genomic Landscape and Mutational Spectrum of ADAMTS Family Genes in Mendelian Disorders Based on Gene Evidence Review for Variant Interpretation.  ;ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs) are a family of multidomain extracellular protease enzymes with 19 members. A growing number of ADAMTS family gene variants have been identified in patients with various hereditary diseases. To understand the genomic landscape and mutational spectrum of ADAMTS family genes, we evaluated all reported variants in the ClinVar database and Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD), as well as recent literature on Mendelian hereditary disorders associated with ADAMTS family genes. Among 1089 variants in 14 genes reported in public databases, 307 variants previously suggested for pathogenicity in Mendelian diseases were comprehensively re-evaluated using the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) 2015 guideline. A total of eight autosomal recessive genes were annotated as being strongly associated with specific Mendelian diseases, including two recently discovered genes (ADAMTS9 and ADAMTS19) for their causality in congenital diseases (nephronophthisis-related ciliopathy and nonsyndromic heart valve disease, respectively). Clinical symptoms and affected organs were extremely heterogeneous among hereditary diseases caused by ADAMTS family genes, indicating phenotypic heterogeneity despite their structural and functional similarity. ADAMTS6 was suggested as presenting undiscovered pathogenic mutations responsible for novel Mendelian disorders. Our study is the first to highlight the genomic landscape of ADAMTS family genes, providing an appropriate genetic approach for clinical use.

Transfemoral transcatheter puncture of interventricular septum in a swine model: A novel transfemoral-venous access to left ventricle with the assistance of arterio-venous circuit.  ;OBJECTIVE: Via subclavian/jugular vein, successful puncture of interventricular septum (IVS) has been achieved transvenously. However, the approach was limited by acute entry-angle. The study was conducted to investigate a novel transcatheter puncture of IVS via femoral access and transfemoral-venous access to left ventricle (LV) through IVS. METHODS: Via femoral artery, transcatheter puncture of mid-IVS was performed with a custom-made nickel-titanium needle and 6F-sheath in 16 healthy mini-swine. Then femoral arterio-venous circuit was established through IVS. After pre-dilation of IVS, a 20F-sheath was introduced into LV transvenously over-the-guidewire in 15 swine. Furthermore, transfemoral-venous TAVR was attempted with the approach in another swine. IVS was evaluated postoperatively and was further confirmed pathologically 2 months later. RESULTS: All transcatheter puncture of IVS was performed successfully in LV and the mid-IVS thickness was 7.67 ± 0.98 mm. In all swine, femoral arterio-venous circuit was established via IVS, and a 20F-sheath was introduced into LV and aorta transfemoral-venously (entry-angle: 145.3 ± 12.2° in front view). After the procedure, there was one swine with moderate tricuspid-regurgitation and five swine with mild residual-shunt (2.6 ± 0.7 mm). Two months later, residual-shunt was still detected in three swine and the communication was confirmed pathologically. In other swine, no defect occurred and replacement-scar was identified along puncture-tract. In the swine underwent transfemoral-venous TAVR, prosthetic valve was deployed successfully with good function. CONCLUSIONS: Transfemoral transcatheter puncture of IVS is feasible and safe in a swine model, and large sheath can be introduced into LV transfemoral-venously using the novel access with the aid of vessel circuit.  
Commissural fusion as etiology of bioprosthetic mitral stenosis in a patient with rheumatic heart disease.  ;We report commissural fusion as a unique morphologic etiology of early bioprosthetic mitral valve failure in a woman with a history of rheumatic mitral stenosis. She had undergone mitral valve replacement with a 25-mm Edwards Magna Ease bovine pericardial bioprosthesis 3 years earlier and presented with progressive dyspnea. Transesophageal echocardiography revealed severe bioprosthetic stenosis due to commissural fusion. She underwent percutaneous valve-in-valve implantation with a 26-mm Edwards Sapien 3 prosthesis. Marked symptomatic improvement was noted postprocedurally. We speculate that commissural fusion may be a unique pathologic feature of failing bioprosthetic valves in patients with prior rheumatic mitral valve disease.  
Antithrombotic Therapy After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.  ;The development of transcatheter aortic valve implantation has represented one of the greatest advances in the cardiology field in recent years and has changed clinical practice for patients with aortic stenosis. Despite the continuous improvement in operators' experience and techniques, and the development of new generation devices, thromboembolic and bleeding complications after transcatheter aortic valve implantation remain frequent, and are a major concern due to their negative impact on prognosis in this vulnerable population. In addition, the optimal antithrombotic regimen in this scenario is not known, and current recommendations are mostly empirical and not evidence based. The present review aims to provide an overview of the current status of knowledge, including relevant on-going randomised trials, on antithrombotic treatment strategies after transcatheter aortic valve implantation.  
Detecting Aortic Valve-Induced Abnormal Flow with Seismocardiography and Cardiac MRI.  ;Cardiac MRI (CMR) techniques offer non-invasive visualizations of cardiac morphology and function. However, imaging can be time-consuming and complex. Seismocardiography (SCG) measures physical vibrations transmitted through the chest from the beating heart and pulsatile blood flow. SCG signals can be acquired quickly and easily, with inexpensive electronics. This study investigates relationships between CMR metrics of function and SCG signal features. Same-day CMR and SCG data were collected from 28 healthy adults and 6 subjects with aortic valve disease history. Correlation testing and statistical median/decile calculations were performed with data from the healthy cohort. MR-quantified flow and function parameters in the healthy cohort correlated with particular SCG energy levels, such as peak aortic velocity with low-frequency SCG (coefficient 0.43, significance 0.02) and peak flow with high-frequency SCG (coefficient 0.40, significance 0.03). Valve disease-induced flow abnormalities in patients were visualized with MRI, and corresponding abnormalities in SCG signals were identified. This investigation found significant cross-modality correlations in cardiac function metrics and SCG signals features from healthy subjects. Additionally, through comparison to normative ranges from healthy subjects, it observed correspondences between pathological flow and abnormal SCG. This may support development of an easy clinical test used to identify potential aortic flow abnormalities.  
Role of advanced left ventricular imaging in adults with aortic stenosis.  ;This review focuses on the available data regarding the utility of advanced left ventricular (LV) imaging in aortic stenosis (AS) and its potential impact for optimising the timing of aortic valve replacement. Ejection fraction is currently the only LV parameter recommended to guide intervention in AS. The cut-off value of 50%, recommended for decision-making in asymptomatic patients with AS, is currently under debate. Several imaging parameters have emerged as predictors of disease progression and clinical outcomes in this setting. Global longitudinal LV strain by speckle tracking echocardiography is useful for risk stratification of asymptomatic patients with severe AS and preserved LV ejection fraction. Its prognostic value was demonstrated in these patients, but further work is required to define the best thresholds to aid the decision-making process. The assessment of myocardial fibrosis is the most studied application of cardiac magnetic resonance in AS. The detection of replacement fibrosis by late gadolinium enhancement offers incremental prognostic information in these patients. Clinical implementation of this technique to optimise the timing of aortic valve intervention in asymptomatic patients is currently tested in a randomised trial. The use of T1 mapping techniques can provide an assessment of interstitial myocardial fibrosis and represents an expanding field of interest. However, convincing data in patients with AS is still lacking. All these imaging parameters have substantial potential to influence the management decision in patients with AS in the future, but data from randomised clinical trials are awaited to define their utility in daily practice.  
Isomerism of the atrial appendages: morphology and terminology.  ;BACKGROUND: Our aim is to identify the pathognomonic anatomical markers and the best terminology to describe the cardiac malformations associated with absent or multiple spleens, which are known as asplenia or polysplenia syndromes or isomerism. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We have reviewed 65 hearts with isomerism of atrial appendages of the Anatomical Collections of Congenital Heart Disease, Institute of Pathological Anatomy of the University of Padua consisting of 1800 specimens. All the hearts were classified according to sequential segmental classification. RESULTS: The incidence of isomerism was 3.6%. Of the total, 45 hearts with isomerism of right atrial appendages showed bilateral trilobed lungs, short bronchi, and absent spleen. The atrioventricular junction was univentricular in 49% of cases with a common atrioventricular valve in 91%. Pulmonary atresia and double outlet right ventricle were present in 40% and 47% of cases, respectively. Total anomalous pulmonary venous drainage and absent coronary sinus were always present. In 20 hearts with isomerism of left atrial appendages, bilateral bilobed lungs with long bilateral bronchi and multiple spleens were always found. The biventricular atrioventricular connection was present in 65% with a common valve in 30% of the hearts. The ventriculoarterial connection was concordant in 45% of cases, and aortic atresia and pulmonary atresia were both noted in 15% of each. An anomalous symmetric pulmonary venous drainage was observed in 65% of the hearts and interruption of inferior vena cava was found in 75% of cases. CONCLUSIONS: We believe that the appropriate terminology is based on the symmetrical morphology of the atrial appendages. The absence of the coronary sinus and the total anomalous pulmonary venous drainage are the markers of isomerism of the right atrial appendages. Symmetric pulmonary venous drainage and interruption of inferior vena cava are the markers of isomerism of left atrial appendages. In recent years, thanks to the improvement of clinical diagnosis and of surgical techniques these patients have the possibility to survive to adult age.

Mechanics and Microstructure of the Atrioventricular Heart Valve Chordae Tendineae: A Review.  ;The atrioventricular heart valves (AHVs) are responsible for directing unidirectional blood flow through the heart by properly opening and closing the valve leaflets, which are supported in their function by the chordae tendineae and the papillary muscles. Specifically, the chordae tendineae are critical to distributing forces during systolic closure from the leaflets to the papillary muscles, preventing leaflet prolapse and consequent regurgitation. Current therapies for chordae failure have issues of disease recurrence or suboptimal treatment outcomes. To improve those therapies, researchers have sought to better understand the mechanics and microstructure of the chordae tendineae of the AHVs. The intricate structures of the chordae tendineae have become of increasing interest in recent literature, and there are several key findings that have not been comprehensively summarized in one review. Therefore, in this review paper, we will provide a summary of the current state of biomechanical and microstructural characterizations of the chordae tendineae, and also discuss perspectives for future studies that will aid in a better understanding of the tissue mechanics-microstructure linking of the AHVs' chordae tendineae, and thereby improve the therapeutics for heart valve diseases caused by chordae failures.

Long-term follow-up after Bentall operation using a stentless Shelhigh NR-2000 bio-conduit.  ;BACKGROUND: To analyze the long-term results after Bentall operation using the stentless Shelhigh No-React (NR)-2000 bio-root prosthesis. MATERIAL: From 2004 to 2008, 26 consecutive, nonselected patients (mean age at surgery: 67 ± 9 years) underwent a Bentall operation using a stentless Shelhigh valved conduit at our institution. Mean preoperative Logistic-EuroSCORE was 17.1 ± 12.9. The mean size of the aortic root was 53.2 ± 5 mm. The mean preoperative ejection fraction was 55 ± 7.4%. Three patients had a bicuspid valve. One patient with acute endocarditis and one patient with type A aortic dissection were operated on an emergency. Three patients (11.54%) had a previous cardiac operation. The Button-Bentall technique was used in all cases. Seven patients (26.92%) received an associated procedure. The mean size of the implanted prosthesis was 26.1 ± 2.2. Follow-up ranged between 6 and 174 months (mean 93.4 ± 59.1 months). Primary endpoints consisted of early and late mortality, freedom from acute endocarditis, freedom from structural valve deterioration, and freedom from valve-related-reoperation. RESULTS: Two patients died in hospital, while 10 patients died during follow-up time, of which three for cardiac causes (12.5%). Overall survival probability was 52.9% at 15 years. Freedom from acute endocarditis was 95.7% at 5 and 15 years. Freedom from severe aortic incompetence due to structural deterioration was 100% at 5 and 10 years, 90.9% at 15 years. The mean aortic gradient at follow-up was 11.4 ± 5 mm Hg. Freedom from valve-related reoperation was 100% at 5 and 10 years, 90.9% at 15 years. CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, Bentall's operation using the Shelhigh NR-2000 stentless bio-conduit provided satisfactory early and long-term results. However, our findings are not consistent with unfavorable long-term outcomes following the implantation of this device reported by other authors.  
Robotic mitral valve repair in a type B hemophiliac.  ;Hemophilia B is a rare X-linked recessive disorder that places surgical patients at an increased risk of bleeding. Patients with hemophilia are now achieving near-normal life expectancies and therefore the number of these patients requiring cardiac surgery due to the development of age-related cardiovascular disease may increase. We present the case of a young male with hemophilia B who was diagnosed with severe symptomatic mitral regurgitation and underwent successful robotic mitral valve repair. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a patient with hemophilia B who underwent robotic mitral valve repair.  
Total pulmonary artery replacement with an Avalus-Gelweave conduit in a patient with giant pulmonary artery aneurysm with pulmonary regurgitation.  ;BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Pulmonary artery aneurysm is a rare disease. A 59-year-old Chinese female was diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary aneurysm with pulmonary regurgitation. She had a past medical history of hemoptysis and systemic lupus erythematosus. METHODS: She underwent a successful total pulmonary artery and valve replacement with an Avalus-Gelweave conduit. RESULTS: The postoperative echocardiogram showed a 7 mm Hg peak gradient across the prosthetic valve. The patient's postoperative recovery was uncomplicated. CONCLUSIONS: A bioprosthetic aortic valve can be used in a pulmonary position to achieve a good gradient and avoid long term anticoagulation therapy.  
Clinical characteristics, diagnosis, and risk stratification of pulmonary hypertension in severe tricuspid regurgitation and implications for transcatheter tricuspid valve repair.  ;AIMS: Patients with pulmonary hypertension (PHT) are often excluded from surgical therapies for tricuspid regurgitation (TR). Transcatheter tricuspid valve repair (TTVR) with the MitraClip™ technique is a novel treatment option for these patients. We aimed to assess the role of PHT in severe TR and its implications for TTVR. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 243 patients underwent TTVR at two centres. One hundred twenty-one patients were grouped as iPHT+ [invasive systolic pulmonary artery pressures (PAPs) ≥50 mmHg]. Patients were similarly stratified according to echocardiographic PAPs (ePHT). The occurrence of the combined clinical endpoint (death, heart failure hospitalization, and reintervention) was investigated during a follow-up of 330 (interquartile range 175-402) days. iPHT+ patients were at higher preoperative risk (P < 0.01), had more severe symptoms (P = 0.01), higher N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels (P < 0.01), more impaired right ventricular (RV) function (P < 0.01), and afterload corrected RV function (P < 0.01). Procedural TTVR success was similar in iPHT+ and iPHT- patients (84 vs. 84%, P = 0.99). The echocardiographic diagnostic accuracy to detect iPHT was only 55%. During follow-up, 35% of patients reached the combined clinical endpoint. The discordant diagnosis of iPHT+/ePHT- carried the highest risk for the combined clinical endpoint [HR 3.76 (CI 2.25-6.37), P < 0.01], while iPHT+/ePHT+ patients had a similar survival-free time from the combined endpoint compared to iPHT- patients (P = 0.48). In patients with isolated tricuspid procedure (n = 131) a discordant iPHT+/ePHT- diagnosis and an impaired afterload corrected RV function (P < 0.01 for both) were independent predictors for the occurrence of the combined endpoint. CONCLUSION: The discordant echocardiographic and invasive diagnosis of PHT in severe TR predicts outcomes after TTVR.  
Removal of intracardiac bone cement embolism after percutaneous kyphoplasty: A case report.  ;RATIONALE: Leakage of bone cement is a common complication after percutaneous kyphoplasty. In rare cases, bone cement can leak into the venous system, which can be life threatening, especially when it causes an embolism in the heart. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 79-year-old female patient developed chest pain with chest tightness 3 weeks after the percutaneous kyphoplasty. DIAGNOSES: Initially, negative fluoroscopy results and elevated myocardial enzymes suggested that the patient's chest pain and chest tightness symptoms were manifestations of coronary heart disease. However, in the subsequent computed tomography (CT) examination, foreign bodies in the heart and pulmonary vessels were found. INTERVENTIONS: The patient underwent emergency surgery to remove the bone cement and repair the tricuspid valve. OUTCOMES: The postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged on the 13th day after surgery. LESSONS: If a patient develops chest pain with chest tightness after percutaneous kyphoplasty, the clinicians must be vigilant and take into account the limited sensitivity of fluoroscopy and use chest computer tomography and echocardiogram as the first choice and thereby prevent serious consequences.  
Mitral and tricuspid stenosis caused by light chain cardiac amyloid deposition.  ;Cardiac amyloidosis results in an infiltrative restrictive cardiomyopathy, with a number of characteristic features: biventricular hypertrophy, abnormal myocardial global longitudinal strain with relative apical sparing, biatrial dilation, and small pericardial effusion along with conduction abnormalities. Amyloid deposits leading to hemodynamically significant valvular heart disease are very rare. We describe a rare case of concomitant moderately severe tricuspid and mitral valve stenosis because of ongoing amyloid deposition in a patient with progressive multiple myeloma and fat pad biopsy-proven light chain amyloidosis. Worsening infiltrative cardiomyopathy and valvulopathy despite evidence-based chemotherapy and heart failure pharmacotherapy led to end-stage disease and death. Valvular involvement in cardiac amyloidosis requires early recognition of the underlying disease condition to guide directed medical therapy and prevent its progression. In this instance, valvuloplasty or valve replacement is not a viable option.  
Current state of transcatheter tricuspid valve repair.  ;Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is a common valvular heart disease affecting >1.6 million people in the United States (US) and >70 million people worldwide. The age- and sex-adjusted prevalence of more than or equal to moderate TR in the US is estimated to be 0.55%. One-year mortality increases with increasing severity of TR. Yet, the majority of patients with severe TR are managed medically in the absence of another indication for cardiac surgery, and isolated tricuspid valve (TV) surgery remains infrequent. To address this unmet clinical need, various transcatheter TV therapies are now being developed as an alternative to surgery in extreme- and high-risk patients with severe functional TR. Transcatheter TV repair devices are aimed at improving leaflet coaptation either directly by bringing the leaflets together (leaflet/coaptation devices) or indirectly by repairing the dilated annulus (annuloplasty devices). In this review, we describe the current state of transcatheter TV repair therapies and summarize the available data on the efficacy and safety of various devices. Procedural and clinical outcomes of transcatheter TV repair therapies are expected to improve in the coming years with technological advancement, newer device iterations, and increased experience in this field. Appropriate patient selection, optimal timing of intervention, and evaluation of long-term outcomes and device durability will be key in ongoing and future studies.  
Review of alternative access in transcatheter aortic valve replacement.  ;Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has surpassed surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) as the most common treatment strategy for severe symptomatic aortic stenosis over the past decade. As TAVR technology has continued to advance, it has been expanded from being an option only for extreme risk patients to now being the preferred option for the majority of patients with severe aortic stenosis. Recent trials have shown that TAVR is superior or non-inferior to SAVR even in patients at low surgical risk. One limitation of TAVR is the need for large bore vascular access. This has improved over time with smaller sheath sizes and improved delivery systems, but is still a significant issue in a patient population that often has many comorbidities including peripheral arterial disease. Early in the TAVR experience the only option for alternative access was transapical access, which has consistently been linked to increased procedural complications and worsened clinical outcomes. However, in recent years several centers have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of several alternative access strategies including transaxillary, transcarotid, transcaval, and direct aortic. There are no randomized data comparing these strategies, so access site approach is chosen by the multidisciplinary heart team based on patient anatomy and site expertise. We will review the current data in alternative access that in our view supports prioritizing a transaxillary or transcarotid strategy. In addition, we will describe our center's pre-procedural planning, peri-procedural approach, and propose an algorithm for alternative access.  
Extremely rare and giant cavernous cardiac hemangioma.  ;DOI: 10.5606/tgkdc.dergisi.2020.18902 PMCID: PMC7067030 PMID: 32175166  
Automated detection of heart valve diseases using chirplet transform and multiclass composite classifier with PCG signals.  ;Heart valve diseases (HVDs) are a group of cardiovascular abnormalities, and the causes of HVDs are blood clots, congestive heart failure, stroke, and sudden cardiac death, if not treated timely. Hence, the detection of HVDs at the initial stage is very important in cardiovascular engineering to reduce the mortality rate. In this article, we propose a new approach for the detection of HVDs using phonocardiogram (PCG) signals. The approach uses the Chirplet transform (CT) for the time-frequency (TF) based analysis of the PCG signal. The local energy (LEN) and local entropy (LENT) features are evaluated from the TF matrix of the PCG signal. The multiclass composite classifier formulated based on the sparse representation of the test PCG instance for each class and the distances from the nearest neighbor PCG instances are used for the classification of HVDs such as mitral regurgitation (MR), mitral stenosis (MS), aortic stenosis (AS), and healthy classes (HC). The experimental results show that the proposed approach has sensitivity values of 99.44%, 98.66%, and 96.22% respectively for AS, MS and MR classes. The classification results of the proposed CT based features are compared with existing approaches for the automated classification of HVDs. The proposed approach has obtained the highest overall accuracy as compared to existing methods using the same database. The approach can be considered for the automated detection of HVDs with the Internet of Medical Things (IOMT) applications.  
Effect of expiratory phase for radiographic detection of left heart enlargement in dogs with mitral regurgitation.  ;Radiography is a standard diagnostic test for characterizing left heart enlargement in dogs however limited information is available on the effects of respiratory phases. This prospective and retrospective method comparison study investigated the respiratory effect on the size and shape of the left heart in dogs to determine the usefulness of expiratory radiographs to detect enlargements in the left atrium (LA) and left ventricle (LV). Thoracic radiographs taken at full inspiration and expiration were evaluated in 20 normal beagles and 100 dogs diagnosed with mitral regurgitation (MR). Vertebral heart score (VHS), vertebral left atrial size, elevation of the carina, and dorsal bulging of LA on lateral view and lateral bulging of the left auricular appendage and LV on ventrodorsal view were assessed. In normal dogs, there were no significant differences in the evaluative factors between inspiration and expiration. In dogs with MR, VHS did not change according to respiration. However, bulging of the LA, left auricular appendage, and LV had sharp margin during expiration compared with inspiration. The expiratory radiographic finding of LA bulging had a higher correlation with the LA to aorta ratio compared with LA bulging in the inspiratory radiography. Using a LA to aorta echocardiographic ratio greater than 1.5 as the gold standard, the radiographic sensitivity for LA enlargement was higher during expiration than inspiration. These findings of our study indicated that expiratory radiography can be helpful to support the detection of left heart enlargement, although it can overestimate LA enlargement in dogs with MR.  
Distribution Patterns of Valvular and Vascular Complications in Bicuspid Aortic Valve.  ;For its high occurrence and elevated risks for aortic valve dysfunction and vascular complications, bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) represents a great health challenge. However, the prevalence and clinical features of BAV in the Chinese population are inadequately illustrated.From January 2011 to December 2015, 3,673 BAV patients with 69.1% male predominance were identified among 325,910 recipients of transthoracic echocardiography in our institution, demonstrating 58.4% overt aortic valve dysfunction, 52.5% ascending aortic dilatation, and 19.2% aortic root dilatation. The prevalence of pure aortic stenosis and mixed aortic valve dysfunction rose strikingly with age (both P < 0.0001), while pure aortic regurgitation showed significant decrease with age (P < 0.0001). Males showed elevated prevalence of pure aortic regurgitation (OR 3.16, 95% CI 2.55-3.91, P < 0.0001) and mixed aortic valve dysfunction than females (OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.23-2.17, P = 0.0008), but lower prevalence of pure aortic stenosis (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.43-0.60, P < 0.0001). Aortic root dilatation was associated with male gender (OR 5.02, 95% CI 3.74-6.74, P < 0.0001), pure aortic regurgitation (OR 2.61, 95% CI 2.15-3.17, P < 0.0001), and right-left (RL) cusp fusion type (OR 1.98, 95% CI 1.64-2.40, P < 0.0001). Ascending aortic dilatation was associated with an elder age (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.04-1.05, P < 0.0001), pure aortic stenosis (OR 1.37, 95% CI 1.16-1.61 P = 0.0002), and mixed aortic valve dysfunction (OR 2.51, 95% CI 1.89-3.33, P < 0.0001).Bicuspid aortic stenosis and ascending aortic dilatation demonstrate a similar pattern of age escalation, while aortic regurgitation is more prevalent in younger BAV patients. Aortic root dilatation intervenes closely with a unique phenotypic subgroup of male BAV patients with pure aortic regurgitation and RL fusion type.  
IgA Vasculitis Triggered by Infective Endocarditis of Pulmonary Artery with Congenitally Corrected Transposition of the Great Arteries.  ;A man in his 40s with a history of congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries (CCTGA) and closure of ventricular septal defect was referred to our hospital with purpura and hematuria. Presence of purpura, renal damage, and pathological findings on skin biopsy led to the diagnosis of IgA vasculitis (IgAV). Oral prednisolone (PSL) was initiated. However, Streptococcus pseudoporcinus was isolated from blood cultures, and transthoracic echocardiogram revealed vegetation on the pulmonary valve. From these findings, the diagnosis of infective endocarditis (IE) was made. Although the patient's condition improved after PSL interruption and antibiotic administration, his purpura relapsed. PSL readministration improved symptoms, with no further relapse even after gradual PSL dose reduction. The present case raises awareness of the importance of recognizing the occurrence of IE in IgAV patients, especially in those with congenital heart disease. CCTGA should be acknowledged as a risk factor for IE in the right-sided heart.  
Trends in Infective Endocarditis Hospitalizations, Characteristics, and Valve Operations in Patients With Opioid Use Disorders in the United States: 2005-2014.  ;Background To evaluate changes in patient characteristics and outcomes for infective endocarditis (IE) related to opioid use disorder (OUD), we used the National (Nationwide) Inpatient Sample (NIS) to characterize the trend in hospitalizations for patients with IE with and without OUD and those treated medically and surgically. Methods and Results Temporal trends in hospitalization characteristics for patients with IE with and without OUD and those treated medically and surgically were estimated via the NIS data in 2005-2014. Hospitalizations for OUD and IE increased from 119 to 202 and from 12 to 15 cases per 100 000 between 2005 and 2014, respectively. Hospitalizations with OUD among all IE hospitalizations increased from 6.3% in 2005 to 11.6% in 2014. Among all IE hospitalizations, patients being admitted for IE in the setting of OUD were younger compared with the cohort of IE without OUD (aged 37.6±0.21 years versus 60.9±0.16 years). Myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, peripheral vascular disease, and heart failure were more common in patients without OUD. The OUD cohort more frequently had liver disease (46.0% versus 10.8%) and immunosuppressed status (4.3% versus 2.1%). Valve operations for IE accounted for 10.2% of all valve operations in 2005, and this increased to 12.7% in 2014. These proportions were similar between OUD (11.4%) and non-OUD (11.1%) cohorts. Operative mortality was lower in patients with OUD (4.3% versus 9.4%, P<0.001). Conclusions IE associated with OUD has a distinct phenotype and has become more prevalent. Surgical outcomes are favorable and operations were performed in similar proportions of patients who had IE with OUD compared with patients who had IE without OUD.  
Ultrasound Guidance to Reduce Vascular and Bleeding Complications of Percutaneous Transfemoral Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: A Propensity Score-Matched Comparison.  ;"Background Ultrasound (US) guidance provides the unique opportunity to control the puncture zone of the artery during transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve replacement and may decrease major vascular complications (VC) and life-threatening or major bleeding complications. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical impact of US guidance using a propensity score-matched comparison. Methods and Results US guidance was implemented as the default approach for all transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve replacement cases in our institution in June 2013. We defined 3 groups of consecutive patients according to the method of puncture (fluoroscopic/US guidance) and the use of a transcatheter heart valve. Patients in the US-guided second-generation group (Sapien XT [Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA], Corevalve [Medtronic, Dublin, Ireland]) were successfully 1:1 matched with patients in the fluoroscope-guided second-generation group (n=95) with propensity score matching. In a second analysis we described the consecutive patients of the US-guided third-generation group (Evolut-R [Medtronic], Sapien 3 [Edwards Lifesciences], n=308). All vascular and bleeding complications were reduced in the US-guided second-generation group compared with the fluoroscope-guided second-generation group: VC (16.8% versus 6.3%; P=0.023); life-threatening or major bleeding (22.1% versus 6%; P=0.004); and VC related to vascular access (12.6% versus 4.2%; P=0.052). In the US-guided third-generation group the rates of major VC and life-threatening or major bleeding were 3.2% (95% CI, 1.6% to 5.9%) and 3.6% (95% CI, 1.8% to 6.3%). In the overall population (n=546), life-threatening or major bleeding was associated with a 1.7-fold increased mortality risk (P=0.02). Conclusions We demonstrated that US guidance effectively reduced VC and bleeding complications for transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve replacement and should be considered the standard puncture method.

Contemporary Trends and Outcomes of Percutaneous and Surgical Mitral Valve Replacement or Repair in Patients With Cancer.  ;"In the era of emerging options for mitral valvular intervention, we sought to characterize the relative utilization, outcomes, and posthospital dispositions of patients referred for transcatheter mitral valve repair (TMVRepair) and surgical mitral valve procedures (SMVP), by cancer-status. Leveraging the National Inpatient Sample, a representative national dataset, ICD-9 codes for all adults >18 years with co-morbid mitral regurgitation, and cancer without metastatic disease admitted from 2003 to 2015 were queried. TMVRepair was performed in 700 hospitalizations from 2012 to 2015, whereas SMVP was utilized during 12,863 hospitalizations from 2003 to 2015. During follow-up, we observed a proportional increase in TMVRepair utilization among cancer patients (vs noncancer), particularly in 2015 (14.2% vs 8.2%, p <0.0001). There was no difference in in-hospital mortality (1.4% vs 1.8%, p = 0.71), ischemic stroke (0.7% vs 0.6%, p = 0.97), major bleeding (8.6% vs 10.9%, p = 0.36), and home discharge (62.1% vs 65.7%, p = 0.45) by cancer-status among patients who underwent TMVRepair; but, cost of care was increased ($52,325 vs $48,832, p <0.0001). Similarly, there was no difference in in-hospital mortality (3.1% vs 3.4%, p = 0.36), ischemic stroke (2.6% vs 3.1%, p = 0.16) as well as the cost-of-care ($58,106 vs $58,844, p = 0.49) among those who underwent SMVP across the same period; but, cancer was associated with increased major bleeding (34.9% vs 30.5%, p <0.0001), and lower likelihood of home discharge (32.8% vs 38.6%, p <0.0001). In conclusion, TMVRepair and SMVP were associated with comparable in-hospital mortality and outcomes in cancer versus noncancer patients. However, cancer patients treated with SMVP experienced more frequent bleeding related complications compared with noncancer patients.  "
Macrophage lineages in heart valve development and disease.  ;Heterogeneous macrophage lineages are present in the aortic and mitral valves of the heart during development and disease. These populations include resident macrophages of embryonic origins and recruited monocyte-derived macrophages prevalent in disease. Soon after birth, macrophages from hematopoietic lineages are recruited to the heart valves, and bone marrow transplantation studies in mice demonstrate that hematopoietic-derived macrophages continue to invest adult valves. During myxomatous heart valve disease, monocyte-derived macrophages are recruited to the heart valves and they contribute to valve degeneration in a mouse model of Marfan syndrome. Here we review recent studies of macrophage lineages in heart valve development and disease with discussion of clinical significance and therapeutic applications.

Prognostic value of residual vegetation after antibiotic treatment for infective endocarditis: A retrospective cohort study.  ;"BACKGROUND: The prognostic impact of residual vegetation (RV) after medical treatment for endocarditis remains unknown. METHODS: 134 consecutive patients hospitalized for infective endocarditis, not surgically treated, with the presence of vegetation at diagnosis, were included retrospectively. The follow-up started at the end of antibiotic treatment when healing was complete. The presence or absence of RV was assessed at this time. The primary endpoint was a composite of the occurrence of embolic events, recurrence of endocarditis, or death from any cause. RESULTS: Eighty-five patients were men (63%), mean age was 69 ± 15 years, and median follow-up was 16.3 (IQR: 5-30) months. Sixty-six patients (49%) had RV, 15 (11%) had RV > 10 mm and nine (7%) had RV with an increase in size relative to that of the diagnosis. The primary endpoint occurred in 23 patients (35%) in the group with RV, and in 16 patients (24%) without RV, which was not statistically relevant (HR 1.70; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89-3.22; p = 0.10). Based on univariate Cox regression analysis, the occurrence of the primary endpoint was associated with RV that increased (HR 3.90 95% CI 1.61-9.43; p < 0.01), RV size (HR 1.05; 95% CI 1.01-1.09; p < 0.01) or RV > 10 mm (HR 3.35; 95% CI 1.51-7.39; p < 0.01). Only RV > 10 mm remained significant in multivariate Cox regression: HR3.29; 95% CI 1.20-8.96; p = 0.02. CONCLUSIONS: RV is frequent but has no clear prognostic impact in itself; however, its size, particularly in comparison with the start-of-treatment data, merits particular attention as being potentially associated with increased risk.

A change of heart: Transformation of the electrocardiogram in a patient with apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  ;An asymptomatic 83-year-old man with a history of hypertension, prior stroke with no residual deficits, and bilateral carotid artery stenosis, presented for evaluation prior to cataract surgery. His transthoracic echocardiogram was typical for apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (AHCM), and his electrocardiograms (ECG) showed large precordial R-waves and inverted T-waves, previously associated with AHCM, while his ECG 7 years earlier was normal. Mechanistic explanations for the developed ECG abnormalities, and their importance for the detection and monitoring of patients with AHCM are provided.  
Outcomes of mitral valve repair compared with replacement for patients with rheumatic heart disease.  ;"OBJECTIVE: Whether mitral valve repair is superior to replacement in the population with rheumatic heart disease has been debated. This study aims to compare outcomes of repair with replacement by the propensity score method. METHODS: This observational, prospective study enrolled patients with rheumatic heart disease who underwent mitral valve repair and replacement from January 2011 to April 2019. The propensity score method was used to select 2 groups with similar baseline characteristics. Baseline, clinical, and follow-up data were collected. Clinical outcomes included death from any cause, reoperation, and valve-related complications. RESULTS: The overall population before matching (N = 1644) included 612 patients who underwent repair and 1032 patients who underwent replacement. The propensity score analysis generated matches for 1058 patients (529 pairs). The median follow-up time was 4.12 years. Early mortality and death from any cause during follow-up were significantly lower in the repair group compared with the replacement group (hazard ratio, 0.19; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.05-0.64; P = .003; hazard ratio, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.19-0.74; P = .003, respectively). Patients in the repair group had a lower risk of valve-related complications compared with patients in the replacement group (subhazard ratio, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.21-0.90; P = .025). In terms of reoperation, no significant difference was observed between the repair and replacement groups (subhazard ratio, 2.54; 95% CI, 0.89-7.22; P = .081). CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that rheumatic mitral valve repair in select patients is superior to mitral valve replacement with regard to lower mortality and fewer valve-related complications; meanwhile, it has a comparable risk of reoperation compared with replacement.

Robotic Cardiac Surgery.  ;"Robotic minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass is the most common robotic coronary procedure performed worldwide. It can be used to treat isolated left anterior descending (LAD) stenosis or can be coupled with percutaneous coronary intervention to diseased non-LAD targets in patients with multivessel disease. Virtually all types of mitral valve repair can be performed using the robot; valve replacement can also be undertaken. The robot can be used to repair atrial septal defects and resect cardiac myxoma. Increased cost of the robotic procedure may be offset by fewer perioperative complications, shorter hospital stay, and faster postoperative recovery.  "
Proteoglycan 4 is Increased in Human Calcified Aortic Valves and Enhances Valvular Interstitial Cell Calcification.  ;Aortic valve stenosis (AVS), a consequence of increased fibrosis and calcification of the aortic valve leaflets, causes progressive narrowing of the aortic valve. Proteoglycans, structural components of the aortic valve, accumulate in regions with fibrosis and moderate calcification. Particularly, proteoglycan 4 (PRG4) has been identified in fibrotic parts of aortic valves. However, the role of PRG4 in the context of AVS and aortic valve calcification has not yet been determined. Here, transcriptomics, histology, and immunohistochemistry were performed in human aortic valves from patients undergoing aortic valve replacement. Human valve interstitial cells (VICs) were used for calcification experiments and RNA expression analysis. PRG4 was significantly upregulated in thickened and calcified regions of aortic valves compared with healthy regions. In addition, mRNA levels of PRG4 positively associated with mRNA for proteins involved in cardiovascular calcification. Treatment of VICs with recombinant human PRG4 enhanced phosphate-induced calcification and increased the mRNA expression of bone morphogenetic protein 2 and the runt-related transcription factor 2. In summary, PRG4 was upregulated in the development of AVS and promoted VIC osteogenic differentiation and calcification. These results suggest that an altered valve leaflet proteoglycan composition may play a role in the progression of AVS.  
Myocardial tissue characterization by gadolinium-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance imaging for risk stratification of adverse events in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  ;Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a genetic cardiomyopathy with a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations. Patients can be asymptomatic or suffer major adverse events including sudden cardiac death, ventricular arrhythmias, and heart failure. Identification of individuals with HCM who are at risk for these complications remains challenging. While echocardiography remains the mainstay of diagnostic evaluation, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) is an important adjunctive diagnostic modality with emerging applications for risk-stratification of adverse events in the HCM population. Although not included in current guidelines for HCM management, there is increasing evidence to support the use of CMR for routine prognostic assessment of HCM patients. In this review we discuss the use of CMR techniques, including late gadolinium enhancement, T1 mapping, and quantification of extracellular volume fraction, for the risk stratification of three major adverse events in HCM: sudden cardiac death, ventricular arrhythmias, and congestive heart failure.  
Explaining Heart Failure Hyper-mortality in Sub Saharan Africa: Global Genomic and Environmental Contribution Review.  ;The annual heart failure (HF) mortality rate in Africa is 34% according to the INTERHF study. This is twice the world average of 16.5% and 3.7 times that of South America, 9%. We review evidence-based explanations for the Hyper-mortality of HF, by comparison of North American, Caribbean, Afro-Brazilian with Sub-Saharan African (SSA) nations profiles, and suggest amelioration. 1 year HF mortality rates in SSA ranged from 29% to 58%, and intra-hospital mortality rate from 8 to 26% (n = 8). A clustering of adverse genetic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) predisposing to hypertension and/or left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in the black diaspora may contribute. A higher prevalence of HF with reduced Ejection Fraction (HF r EF) phenotype, which is associated with greater mortality is more common in SSA nations. Additionally, a worse co-morbidity burden, especially valvular regurgitations causing LV remodeling (LVR), chronic kidney disease (CKD), anemia, lung disease, infections, late presentation in NYHA III/IV, right ventricular disease (RVD) were also common in SSA. Geographic variation in SSA, HF risk factors and co-morbidity was observed. There was sub-optimal use of guideline directed medical therapy (GDMT) and intracardiac device (ICD) unavailability. Gross Domestic Product -per purchasing power parity (GDP-PPP), which is low in SSA, was inversely correlated both to higher intra-hospital mortality rate % (r = -0.73, r 2 = 0.54 p = 0.038) and higher 1 year HF mortality rate % (r = -0.62, r 2 = 0.38, = 0.098). Localized primary prevention, early detection and prompt treatment of hypertension, diabetes, rheumatic fever, early cardiac valve repair and use of cardiovascular polypill, optimal use of GDMT, national health insurance scheme are advocated to stem the dismal mortality and cost burden of HF.  
Pulmonary endarteritis and endocarditis complicated with septic embolism: a case report and review of the literature.  ;BACKGROUND: Pulmonary endarteritis is a rare clinical phenomenon with congenital heart that can potentially lead to major complications. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a 47-year-old man with pulmonary endarteritis. This patient presented with hypertension, chest pain and a previous history of pulmonary valve disease during childhood. Also, eight-months prior, he was hospitalized with dyspnea (Functional Class III), cough, phlegm, and night sweats without fever. Echocardiographic diagnosis in the first transtransthoracic echocardiography (TTE) was intense pulmonary valve stenosis (PVS) an, thus, the pulmonary valve vegetation and PVS, established by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). He was referred for surgery after 1 weeks of intravenous antibiotic therapy for removal of the vegetation. CONCLUSIONS: Finally he was asymptomatic at 3-months of follow-up and was clinically in good condition. Therefore, the detection of infective endocarditis of the lung valve must not lengthy be prolonged.  
Evaluation of the NuCLEUS-X™ balloon valvuloplasty catheter for severe pulmonic stenosis in dogs.  ;INTRODUCTION/OBJECTIVES: Balloon instability is commonly encountered during balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty (BPV) and may result in an unsuccessful procedure. The NuCLEUS-X™ catheter is a recently developed BPV catheter with a unique barbell shape and an ordered pattern of inflation that stabilizes the balloon to span the valve annulus before expansion of the balloon center. ANIMALS: Ten client-owned dogs with severe valvular pulmonic stenosis (PS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Prospective observational study. The BPV procedure was performed by standard technique with use of NuCLEUS-X™ catheters targeting a balloon-to-annulus ratio between 1.2 and 1.5. Balloon stability, safety, and procedural success were assessed. Procedural success was defined as either a reduction in the Doppler transpulmonic PG by at least 50% of the pre-procedural PG or <80 mmHg one month post procedure. RESULTS: Balloon stability centered at the pulmonic valve on the first inflation was achieved in 10/10 cases. The mean PG before BPV was 141 mmHg ±41 mmHg, and the PG after BPV at one month was 83 mmHg ±41 mmHg. Procedural success was achieved in 56% of patients. All dogs survived the BPV, and no major procedural complications were encountered using the NuCLEUS-X™ catheter. CONCLUSIONS: The use of the NuCLEUS-X™ catheter is feasible for BPV in dogs with severe PS. The unique balloon shape provided catheter stability on the first inflation in all dogs, which may be beneficial when stabilization of a conventional BPV catheter cannot be achieved.

Quadricuspid pulmonary valve: Is that a matter?  ;DOI: 10.1111/jocs.14500 PMID: 32163626 [Indexed for MEDLINE]  
A four-leaf clover: A case report of quadricuspid aortic valve stenosis.  ;BACKGROUND: We present the case of a patient with severe quadricuspid aortic valve (QAV) stenosis who underwent treatment with transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). CASE SUMMARY: An 87-year-old woman was referred to our department with severe aortic stenosis. Computed tomography angiography revealed a QAV with four separate equal-sized leaflets, similar in appearance to a four-leaf clover. The patient underwent successful implantation of a 23 mm Edwards Sapien 3 transcatheter valve via left transfemoral access. The valve positioning across the aortic annulus was fluoroscopically challenging due to difficulty visualizing all four cusps in only one two-dimensional view and to the position of the left main coronary artery, which was very low. The immediate result of the TAVI was good, with no aortic regurgitation and no coronary damage. Follow-up to 6 months was free of event. CONCLUSION: This case demonstrates that QAV stenosis can be treated using TAVI with good clinical outcomes.

Prosthetic aortic graft replacement of the ascending thoracic aorta alters biomechanics of the native descending aorta as assessed by transthoracic echocardiography.  ;"INTRODUCTION: In patients with ascending aortic (AA) aneurysms, prosthetic graft replacement yields benefit but risk for complications in the descending aorta persists. Longitudinal impact of AA grafts on native descending aortic physiology is poorly understood. METHODS: Transthoracic echocardiograms (echo) in patients undergoing AA elective surgical grafting were analyzed: Descending aortic deformation indices included global circumferential strain (GCS), time to peak (TTP) strain, and fractional area change (FAC). Computed tomography (CT) was used to assess aortic wall thickness and calcification. RESULTS: 46 patients undergoing AA grafting were studied; 65% had congenital or genetically-associated AA (30% bicuspid valve, 22% Marfan, 13% other): After grafting (6.4±7.5 months), native descending aortic distension increased, irrespective of whether assessed based on circumferential strain or area-based methods (both p<0.001). Increased distensibility paralleled altered kinetics, as evidenced by decreased time to peak strain (p = 0.01) and increased velocity (p = 0.002). Augmented distensibility and flow velocity occurred despite similar pre- and post-graft blood pressure and medications (all p = NS), and was independent of pre-surgical aortic regurgitation or change in left ventricular stroke volume (both p = NS). Magnitude of change in GCS and FAC was 5-10 fold greater among patients with congenital or genetically associated AA vs. degenerative AA (p<0.001), paralleling larger descending aortic size, greater wall thickness, and higher prevalence of calcific atherosclerotic plaque in the degenerative group (all p<0.05). In multivariate analysis, congenital/genetically associated AA etiology conferred a 4-fold increment in magnitude of augmented native descending aortic strain after proximal grafting (B = 4.19 [CI 1.6, 6.8]; p = 0.002) independent of age and descending aortic size. CONCLUSIONS: Prosthetic graft replacement of the ascending aorta increases magnitude and rapidity of distal aortic distension. Graft effects are greatest with congenital or genetically associated AA, providing a potential mechanism for increased energy transmission to the native descending aorta and adverse post-surgical aortic remodeling.

Lyme Endocarditis as an Emerging Infectious Disease: A Review of the Literature.  ;Lyme endocarditis is extremely rare manifestation of Lyme disease. The clinical manifestations of Lyme endocarditis are non-specific and can be very challenging diagnosis to make when it is the only manifestation of the disease. Until now, only a few cases where reported. Physicians should keep in mind the possibility of borrelial etiology of endocarditis in endemic areas. Appropriate valve tissue sample should be sent for histopathology, culture, and PCR especially in case of endocarditis of unknown origin PCR on heart valve samples is recommended. With more frequent PCR, Borrelia spp. may be increasingly found as a cause of infective endocarditis. Prompt diagnosis and treatment of Lyme carditis may prevent surgical treatment and pacemaker implantations. Due to climate change and global warming Lyme disease is a growing problem. Rising number of Lyme disease cases we can expect and rising number of Lyme endocarditis.

Meta-analysis of results of subvalvular repair for severe ischemic mitral regurgitation.  ;"BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of this meta-analysis was to compare short- and long-term outcomes of patients undergoing mitral annuloplasty (MA) with or without papillary muscle surgery (PMS) for the treatment of ischemic mitral regurgitation (IMR). METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement were performed. RESULTS: Nine studies met the inclusion criteria. This meta-analysis identified 478 patients: 228 patients underwent MA alone and 250 patients underwent concomitant PMS. Early mortality was similar between two groups (odds ratio [OR] 1.14, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.51-2.53; P = .75). PMS was associated at follow-up with a higher freedom from cardiac-related events (P = .050); moreover, although both surgical techniques had a positive impact on ventricular remodeling, the PMS group showed a significant higher reduction of left ventricle end-diastolic diameter (OR, 4.89, 95% CI, 2.77-7.01; P < .001) and left ventricle end-systolic diameter values (OR, 4.11, 95% CI, 1.98-6.24; P < .001). Finally, PMS compared with MA alone was associated with a significant reduction of recurrent mitral regurgitation at follow-up (OR, 3.25, 95% CI, 1.60-6.59; P = .001). CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis demonstrated superiority in terms of ventricular remodeling of a combined approach encompassing PMS and MA over MA alone in IMR. Moreover, the association of subvalvular surgery with restrictive MA decreases the incidence of mitral regurgitation recurrence and cardiac-related events at follow-up.  "
Urea level is an independent predictor of mortality in patients with severe aortic valve stenosis.  ;"INTRODUCTION: Severe aortic stenosis (AS) is the most common valvular heart disease in the western world. Various factors are related to severe AS prognosis, including chronic kidney disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of urea level in patients with severe AS. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 142 patients (79.1±9.4 years, 88 women) with severe AS (mean valve area 0.67± 0.17 cm2). Clinical assessment, blood tests and echocardiography were performed at enrollment and follow up. The patient population was divided into low and high urea level groups, according to the median urea level at enrollment (72 patients, mean urea 35.5±6.2 mg/dL and 70 patients, mean urea 61.1±17.8 mg/dL, respectively). Hundred and twelve patients (79%) underwent aortic valve intervention. The primary endpoint was all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. OUTCOMES: During follow-up of 37±19.5 months, 56 (37.1%) patients died, 39 due to cardiovascular causes. In univariate analysis, age, urea level, creatinine, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class and aortic valve intervention were associated with all-cause mortality. However, in multivariate analysis only aortic valve intervention and blood urea were independent predictors of all-cause mortality (HR 0.494; 95% CI 0.226-0.918, P = 0.026 and HR 1.015; 95% CI 1.003-1.029, P = 0.046 respectively). Urea level, NYHA class and age were also significant predictors of cardiovascular mortality. Whereas, in multivariate analysis, only urea level predicted cardiovascular mortality in these patients (HR 1.017; CI 1.003-1.031 P = 0.019). CONCLUSIONS: Blood urea, a generally readily available and routinely determined marker of renal function, is an independent prognostic factor in patients with severe AS.  "
Diagnostic analysis of abnormal increase of PASP in fetus in middle- and late-stage pregnancy by color Doppler echocardiography.  ;OBJECTIVE: Our study was conducted with an attempt to investigate the diagnostic analysis of abnormal increase of fetal pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) in middle and late pregnancy by color Doppler echocardiography. METHODS: From August 2017 to January 2019, 52 fetuses with moderate or greater tricuspid high-speed regurgitation were retrospectively analyzed and selected as Group A. 88 fetuses with full-color blood flow of the two ventricles and symmetrical sizes of the cardiac cavities on both sides harboring tricuspid valve and mild regurgitation or a small amount of regurgitation were selected as Group B. The pulmonary artery blood flow acceleration time (AT) and right ventricular ejection time (ET) was measured, and the PASP was calculated. RESULTS: The tricuspid regurgitation velocity, tricuspid regurgitation pressure difference and PASP in Group A were higher than those in Group B (p < 0.05), and the AT and AT/ET values in Group A were lower than those in Group B (p < 0.05). Gestational age, tricuspid regurgitation velocity and tricuspid regurgitation pressure difference were positively correlated with PASP. However, AT/ET and AT value were negatively correlated with PASP. CONCLUSION: The abnormal increase of pulmonary artery can be assessed by color Doppler echocardiography of fetal tricuspid regurgitation, which is worth popularizing and applying in clinic. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: It was suggested that the middle- and late-stage fetuses with moderate or greater tricuspid regurgitation and with >20 mmHg regurgitation pressure difference should be followed up in clinic. If PASP was ≥70 mmHg with symptoms of right heart failure, fetuses should be closely observed until 35-36 weeks old to ensure fetal safety and early delivery would be recommended.

Percutaneous Pulmonary Valve Implantation.  ;Percutaneous pulmonary valve implantation (PPVI) is recognized as a feasible and low risk alternative to surgery to treat dysfunctional right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) in usually pluri-operated patients. Evolving technology allowed to develop different kind of prosthesis and to go from an initial treatment exclusively of stenotic conduit to an actual approach extended also to wide native RVOT. The Melody transcatheter pulmonary valve (TPV) and the Edwards Sapien valve are nowadays the most commonly implanted prostheses. However, other devices have been developed to treat large RVOT (i.e., the Venus p-valve, the Medtronic Harmony TPV, the Alterra Adaptive Prestent, and the Pulsta valve). Indications for PPVI are the same as for surgical interventions on pulmonary valve, with limits related to the maximum diameter of the available percutaneous prosthesis. Therefore, an accurate preoperative evaluation is of paramount importance to select patients who could benefit from this procedure. The overall periprocedural mortality incidence is around 1.4%, while freedom from RVOT reintervention ranges from 100% at 4 months to 70% at 70 months, according to the different published studies.  
Registry of antithrombotic therapy in atrial fibrillation patients with bioprosthetic valves: A retrospective observational study.  ;BACKGROUND: The incidence of cardiovascular diseases, including valvular heart disease and atrial fibrillation (AF), is rising as the elderly population increases. For patients with AF and bioprosthetic valves, current treatment guidelines for antithrombotic therapy vary by country, likely due to a lack of robust study data. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, retrospective, observational analysis of 214 Japanese AF patients after bioprosthetic valve replacement in real-world clinical practice. The primary efficacy endpoint was the incidence of stroke/systemic embolism, and the primary safety endpoint was major bleeding. RESULTS: The mean observation period was 46.0 months. Warfarin was administered to 176 patients (82.2%), direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) to 16 patients (7.5%), and antiplatelet drugs to 13 patients (6.1%). The number of patients who were treated with DOAC was increasing in the later period of registration. Stroke/systemic embolism was observed in 14 patients [1.77 patients/100 person-years (PY)]. Major bleeding was observed in 22 patients (2.83/100 PY). CONCLUSIONS: In a current real-world setting in Japan, warfarin was the most commonly used treatment in AF patients with bioprosthetic valves, but there was an increasing trend of DOAC-treated patients. Further investigations are needed to confirm the efficacy and safety of DOAC in patients with bioprosthetic valves.

Clinical impact of pathology-proven etiology of severely stenotic aortic valves on mid-term outcomes in patients undergoing surgical aortic valve replacement.  ;"BACKGROUND: The use of transcatheter or surgical aortic valve replacement (AVR) for severe aortic stenosis (AS) has considerably increased in recent years. However, the association between AS etiology and mid-term clinical outcomes after surgical AVR has not been fully investigated. METHODS AND RESULTS: We retrospectively included 201 patients (mean age, 75 years; 43%, men) who underwent surgical AVR for severe native AS (aortic valve area ≤1.0 cm2 on preoperative transthoracic echocardiography examination). The following valve etiologies were postoperatively identified on pathological examination: post-inflammatory (n = 28), congenital (n = 35), and calcific/degenerative (n = 138). The median follow-up interval was 4.1 years following surgical AVR. Of the 201 patients, 27% were asymptomatic, 40% had a history of heart failure, and 11% underwent previous heart surgery. The cumulative incidence of cardiac events (all-cause death, aortic valve deterioration requiring repeated AVR, and hospitalization for heart failure) and combined adverse events, which included non-fatal stroke, unplanned coronary revascularization, pacemaker implantation, and gastrointestinal bleeding along with cardiac events, was significantly higher in the calcific/degenerative group (p = 0.02 and p = 0.02, respectively). In multivariate analysis adjusted for age, sex, renal function, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, concomitant surgical procedures, and EuroSCORE II, AS etiology was independently associated with an increased risk of combined adverse events (congenital vs. post-inflammatory: hazard ratio [HR], 4.13; p = 0.02 and calcific/degenerative vs. post-inflammatory: HR, 5.69; p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Pathology-proven AS etiology could aid in predicting the mid-term outcomes after surgical AVR, supporting the importance of accurate identification of severe AS etiology with or without postoperative pathological examination.

Association of echocardiographic measures of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction and hypertrophy with presence of coronary microvascular dysfunction.  ;BACKGROUND: Coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD) is a common disorder, leading to symptoms similar to obstructive coronary artery disease. We aimed to determine whether measures of left ventricular (LV) diastolic function and hypertrophy may predict presence of CMD. METHODS: We retrospectively included patients undergoing diagnostic coronary angiography and transthoracic echocardiography, excluding patients with obstructive coronary artery disease, previous revascularization therapy, moderate or severe mitral valve disease, or atrial fibrillation. The following markers of LV diastolic function and hypertrophy were assessed: E- and A-wave velocity, E-wave deceleration time, E/A- and E/E'-ratio, left atrial area, left LV mass index, LV ejection time (LVET) and mitral valve closure to opening time. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the association of echocardiographic parameters with presence of CMD. RESULTS: From 378 patients (mean age ± SD 59.7 ± 13.6 years, 45.6% male) included, the majority had CMD (n = 293, 77.5%). Patients with CMD were older (60.5 ± 13.4 years vs. 56.9 ± 14.3 years, p = 0.03), were less frequent male (42.3% vs. 57.0%, p = 0.02), and had higher systolic blood pressure (137.9 ± 25.7 mmHg vs. 124.7 ± 25.6 mmHg, p < 0.0001). LVET was significantly associated with CMD (1.42 [1.02-1.96], p = 0.04), while a non-statistically significant link was observed for A-wave velocity and E/E'-ratio (1.39 [0.96-2.00], p = 0.08 and 1.40 [0.92-2.13], p = 0.1, respectively). For all other echocardiography-derived measures, odds ratio for the association with CMD was <1.3 per each SD increase. CONCLUSIONS: In this cross-sectional single-center cohort study, CMD was a frequent finding in patients undergoing coronary angiography for suspected obstructive coronary artery disease. LVET from transthoracic echocardiography is associated with the presence of CMD.  
Impact of transcatheter aortic valve implantation on mechanical dispersion.  ;OBJECTIVES: The physiological determinants of left ventricular (LV) mechanical dispersion (MD) are not fully explored. We aimed to investigate the impact of afterload reduction and changes in ventricular conduction on LV MD after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). METHODS: Patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) were examined in a prospective, repeated measures observational cohort study before and after an uncomplicated transfemoral TAVI in a single tertiary centre. LV MD was assessed by speckle tracking echocardiography. Valvulo-arterial impedance (ZVA) was used as a measure of global afterload. RESULTS: We included 140 consecutive patients (83±8 years old, 49% women, logistic EuroSCORE 16±10) with severe AS (valve area 0.7±0.2 cm2, mean transvalvular gradient 54±18 mm Hg) and a relatively preserved LV ejection fraction (52%±11%). After TAVI, we observed favourable changes in transvalvular gradients and ZVA in all patients. Compared with baseline, postprocedural MD was significantly lower in 108 patients with unchanged ventricular conduction (55±17 ms vs 51±17 ms, p=0.02) and higher in 28 patients with TAVI-induced left bundle branch block (51±13 ms vs 62±19 ms, p≤0.001). During 22±9 months observation, 22 patients died. Postprocedural MD was associated with mortality in a univariate Cox regression model (HR=1.24 (1.01-1.52), p<0.04, per 10 ms increase). CONCLUSIONS: Isolated afterload reduction was associated with reduction of MD, while concomitant impairment of ventricular conduction resulted in a more pronounced MD after TAVI, indicating that loading conditions and conduction should be considered when evaluating MD. A pronounced postprocedural LV MD was associated with mortality.  
Clinical value of the 20% logistic EuroSCORE cut-off for selecting TAVI candidates: a single-centre cohort study analysis.  ;"BACKGROUND: A logistic European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation (logEuroSCORE) ≥20% is frequently recognised as a finite criteria for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) reimbursement, despite guideline modifications to reflect the appropriacy of TAVI in selected lower-risk patients. The aim was to evaluate the clinical value of this threshold cut-off in TAVI patients and to identify factors associated with mortality in those below this threshold. METHODS: We analysed data from a single-centre, German, observational, TAVI-patient registry, gathered between 2008 and 2016. Patients were stratified by logEuroSCORE (≥ or <20%) for comparisons. Logistic regression was performed to identify predictors of mortality at 1 year, with this analysis used to generate a calculated ('real') risk value for each patient. RESULTS: 1679 patients (logEuroSCORE <20%: n=789; logEuroSCORE ≥20%: n=890) were included. LogEuroSCORE <20% patients were significantly younger (80.1 vs 81.6 years; p<0.001) and less comorbid than logEuroSCORE ≥20% patients, with a higher rate of transfemoral TAVI (35.6% vs 26.1%; p<0.001) and predilation (70.0% vs 63.3%; p=0.004). Patients with a logEuroSCORE <20% experienced more vascular complications (3.4% vs 1.5%; p=0.010). One-year survival was 88.3% in the logEuroSCORE <20% and 81.8% in the logEuroSCORE ≥20% group (p=0.005), with the calculated mortality risk falling within 2% of the logEuroSCORE in just 12.9% of patients. In the logEuroSCORE <20% group, only coronary artery disease was significantly predictive of 1-year mortality (OR 2.408; 95% CI 1.361 to 4.262; p=0.003). CONCLUSIONS: At our institution, patients with a logEuroSCORE <20% selected for TAVI have excellent outcomes. The decision not to reimburse TAVI in such patients may be viewed as inappropriate.  "
Clinical use of 4D flow MRI for quantification of aortic regurgitation.  ;OBJECTIVE: The main objective of the present study was to compare the use of four-dimensional (4D) flow MRI with the habitual sequence (two-dimensional phase-contrast (2DPC) MRI) for the assessment of aortic regurgitation (AR) in the clinical routine. METHODS: This was a retrospective, observational cohort study of patients with varying grades of AR. For the purposes of the present study, we selected all the cases with a regurgitant fraction (RF)>5% as determined by 2DPC MRI (n=34). In all cases, both sequences (2DPC and 4D flow MRI) were acquired in a single session to ensure comparability. We compared the results of the two techniques by evaluating forward flow, regurgitant flow and regurgitation fraction. Then, the patients were divided into subgroups to determine if these factors had any influence on the measurements: aortic diameter (≤ vs >38 mm), valve anatomy (tricuspid vs bicuspid/quadricuspid), stenosis (gradient ≥15 vs <15) and region of interest location (aortic valve vs sinotubular junction). RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were observed between the two techniques with Pearson's correlation coefficients (r) of forward flow (r=0.826/p value<0001), regurgitant flow (r=0.866/p value<0001) and RF (r=0.761/p value<0001). CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study confirm the value of 4D flow MRI for grading AR in clinical practice with an excellent correlation with the standard technique (2DPC MRI).  
Aortic valve calcium is associated with left ventricular diastolic function in patients without evidence of ischaemic heart disease: assessment by gated single-photon emission computed tomography.  ;Background: Several studies have shown that aortic valve calcium (AVC) is associated with cardiovascular events. Furthermore, the extent of AVC is associated with adverse prognosis even in patients without significant aortic stenosis. We investigated the relationship between AVC and left ventricular (LV) diastolic parameters determined by gated single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in patients with no evidence of ischaemic heart disease.Methods: This study included 157 patients with no evidence of ischaemic heart disease who underwent both coronary computed tomography and gated SPECT. The AVC scores were calculated by the Agatston method, and peak filling rate (PFR) and one-third mean filling rate (1/3 MFR) were determined as LV diastolic parameters.Results: There were 93 (59%) and 64 (41%) patients with and without AVC, respectively, and the AVC scores ranged from 0 to 1251. There was no significant difference in LV end-diastolic volume (EDV) (60 ± 18 vs 62 ± 25 mL, p = 0.52) or LV ejection fraction (67% ± 10% vs 66% ± 8%, p = 0.60) between the two groups. Patients with AVC had lower PFR (2.2 ± 0.5 vs 2.4 ± 0.5 EDV/s, p = 0.002) and 1/3 MFR (1.3 ± 0.3 vs 1.5 ± 0.4 EDV/s, p = 0.003) than those without AVC. Multivariate linear regression analysis showed that ln(AVC score + 1) was significantly associated with PFR and 1/3 MFR.Conclusion: In patients without evidence of ischaemic heart disease, the extent of AVC was inversely correlated with gated SPECT-derived parameters of LV diastolic function.

Desert hedgehog-primary cilia cross talk shapes mitral valve tissue by organizing smooth muscle actin.  ;Non-syndromic mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is the most common heart valve disease affecting 2.4% of the population. Recent studies have identified genetic defects in primary cilia as causative to MVP, although the mechanism of their action is currently unknown. Using a series of gene inactivation approaches, we define a paracrine mechanism by which endocardially-expressed Desert Hedgehog (DHH) activates primary cilia signaling on neighboring valve interstitial cells. High-resolution imaging and functional assays show that DHH de-represses smoothened at the primary cilia, resulting in kinase activation of RAC1 through the RAC1-GEF, TIAM1. Activation of this non-canonical hedgehog pathway stimulates α-smooth actin organization and ECM remodeling. Genetic or pharmacological perturbation of this pathway results in enlarged valves that progress to a myxomatous phenotype, similar to valves seen in MVP patients. These data identify a potential molecular origin for MVP as well as establish a paracrine DHH-primary cilium cross-talk mechanism that is likely applicable across developmental tissue types.  
Diagnostic coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention practices in New Zealand: The All New Zealand Acute Coronary Syndrome-Quality Improvement CathPCI registry 3-year study (ANZACS-QI 37).  ;BACKGROUND: Coronary heart disease remains one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity in New Zealand (NZ) and globally. The All New Zealand Acute Coronary Syndrome Quality Improvement (ANZACS-QI) programme includes the CathPCI registry which records all those referred for diagnostic coronary angiography (DCA) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in NZ. We present the methods and three-years of data from the ANZACS-QI CathPCI registry. METHODS: The data was extracted from the ANZACS QI CathPCI registry from 01/09/2014 to 24/09/2017. The ANZACS-QI data dictionary defines all the clinical, procedural and outcomes variables collected, and standard statistical analyses were applied. RESULTS: 40,870 patients underwent cardiac catheterisation, with a mean age of 65 years, and males making up 67% of the cohort. Indications included acute coronary syndrome 55%, angina with suspected stable coronary disease 28%, valve surgery workup 8%, planned PCI 3%, heart failure/cardiomyopathy 3%, arrhythmia 1% and other 2%. For those undergoing DCA alone, radial access was used in 85% and two-thirds had at least one major artery with >50% stenosis. PCI was performed in 39% of patients. Drug-eluting stents were used in 97%. CONCLUSION: The CathPCI registry records the characteristics and outcomes of all patients undergoing DCA and PCI in NZ hospitals. As part of the ANZACS-QI programme the registry provides an important platform for quality improvement, research and to inform clinical practice.  
"Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy in ""Real-World"" Community Cardiology Practice.  ";"Differences in presentation and natural history of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HC) between community cardiology practice and referral centers has been a source of considerable uncertainty. We report here a cross-sectional analysis of 253 consecutive HC patients from a ""real-world"" clinical cardiology setting. When compared with a highly selected referral center cohort, patients in clinical practice proved to be similar with regard to disease expression such as left ventricular (LV) wall thickness, outflow obstruction, and natural history, including stable and largely benign clinical course with no or mild symptoms (61% in community practice vs. 55% in referred patients, p = 0.23), occurrence of atrial fibrillation (22% vs. 24%, p = 0.75) and nonfatal sudden death (SD) events (3% vs. 4%, p = 0.8). In contrast, progressive heart failure symptoms were most common in the referral cohort (36% vs. 26%, p = 0.04). In clinical practice, SD was prevented by prophylactic implatable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD) in 5 of 44 patients (11%), although risk was overestimated in 6 patients who were implanted with ICDs in the absence of risk markers (14%). In 16 of 61 (26%) severely symptomatic drug-refractory patients with LV outflow obstruction, recommendation for surgical myectomy (or alcohol septal ablation) was delayed. In conclusion, clinical characteristics and course of HC patients in community practice were generally similar to those in HC referral centers. Community cardiologists managed HC patients predominantly in concert with guideline-based strategies, although risk for SD could be overestimated, and the significance of outflow obstruction with timely reversal of refractory heart failure by intervention was underappreciated.

Sex Differences in In-Hospital Outcomes of Transcatheter Mitral Valve Repair (from a National Database).  ;There is paucity of data on sex differences in outcomes of transcatheter mitral valve repair (TMVR). We queried the National Inpatient Sample database (2012-2016) to identify hospitalizations for TMVR. We conducted a propensity matching analysis to compare hospitalizations for TMVR in men versus women. Our analysis yielded 10,014 hospitalizations for TMVR. TMVR was increasingly performed in both sexes at similar rate. Compared with men, women undergoing TMVR had fewer major comorbidities. After matching, there was no difference in in-hospital mortality between men and women (3.0% vs 2.4%, p = 0.33). Also, there was no difference between men and women in cardiac arrest (2.1% vs 1.3%, p = 0.17), cardiogenic shock (3.9% vs 3.5%, p = 0.66), mechanical support devices (2.4% vs 2.9%, p = 0.45), acute kidney injury (17.8% vs 14.7%, p = 0.08), hemodialysis (1.7% vs 1.6%, p = 0.81), respiratory complications (1.7% vs 1.4%, p = 0.65), acute stroke (1.4% vs 1.3%, p = 0.82), discharges to nursing facilities (12.3% vs 15.2%, p = 0.09), tamponade (0.5% vs 0.4%, p = 0.69), acute myocardial infarction (2.1% vs 2.4%, p = 0.71), and mean length of stay (6.03 ± 8.153 vs 6.08 ± 8.858 days, p = 0.82). TMVR in men was associated with higher incidence of ventricular arrhythmias (7.2% vs 4.1%, p = 0.01) and lower incidence of pacemaker implantations (0.4% vs 1.7%, p = 0.01). In conclusion, this observational study showed that TMVR is increasingly performed in both sexes at similar rate. Despite that women had less comorbidities, there was no difference in in-hospital mortality and major complications for TMVR among women compared with men. Future studies comparing the differences between both sexes in long-term outcomes are encouraged.  
Delayed right coronary ostial obstruction after J-valve deployment in transcatheter aortic valve implantation: A case report.  ;BACKGROUND: Aortic stenosis is the most common valve disease in adults. Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is being increasingly applied for intermediate- to low-risk patients. Here, we describe an uncommon complication of delayed right coronary obstruction in a transapical TAVI case. CASE SUMMARY: A 73-year-old woman with a EuroSCORE II of 1.21% underwent transapical TAVI because of severe aortic stenosis. The surgical procedure was uneventful. However, during routine monitoring after valve placement, the patient had a sudden onset of slow heart rate, the systolic blood pressure dropped sharply from 115 to 60 mmHg, and the central venous pressure abruptly increased from 10 to 33 cmH2O. The patient had a poor response to vasoactive agents. Transesophageal echocardiography revealed poor myocardial contractility, and electrocardiography showed a significant depression of ST-segment. Another angiography was performed immediately, which suggested complete obstruction of the right coronary artery. An emergency protocol was initiated. Cardiopulmonary bypass was established immediately. An aortic biological valve replacement under cardiopulmonary bypass was performed. CONCLUSION: Perioperative monitoring, early recognition, and diagnosis of obstruction of coronary arteries in TAVI are important. Transesophageal echocardiography is a useful diagnostic and monitoring tool in this situation. Emergency protocols should be established during TAVI.

Iliac Artery Intervention.  ;Endovascular revascularization for aortoiliac occlusive disease (AIOD) is now considered first-line therapy for patients with claudication and critical limb ischemia and in asymptomatic patients in whom large-bore access is required (eg, mechanical circulatory support or transcatheter aortic valve replacement). The authors review the data supporting endovascular therapy for AIOD, indications and contraindications for AIOD revascularization, as well as the procedural techniques required to safely perform endovascular therapy in this vascular bed. They review prevention and management of the major complications that can occur during these procedures. Finally, they discuss postprocedural management to maintain patency and optimize patient outcomes.

CRISPLD1: a novel conserved target in the transition to human heart failure.  ;Heart failure is a major health problem worldwide with a significant morbidity and mortality rate. Although studied extensively in animal models, data from patients at the compensated disease stage are lacking. We sampled myocardium biopsies from aortic stenosis patients with compensated hypertrophy and moderate heart failure and used transcriptomics to study the transition to failure. Sequencing and comparative analysis of analogous samples of mice with transverse aortic constriction identified 25 candidate genes with similar regulation in response to pressure overload, reflecting highly conserved molecular processes. The gene cysteine-rich secretory protein LCCL domain containing 1 (CRISPLD1) is upregulated in the transition to failure in human and mouse and its function is unknown. Homology to ion channel regulatory toxins suggests a role in Ca2+ cycling. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated loss-of-function leads to dysregulated Ca2+ handling in human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes. The downregulation of prohypertrophic, proapoptotic and Ca2+-signaling pathways upon CRISPLD1-KO and its upregulation in the transition to failure implicates a contribution to adverse remodeling. These findings provide new pathophysiological data on Ca2+ regulation in the transition to failure and novel candidate genes with promising potential for therapeutic interventions.  
22q11.2 deletion syndrome is associated with increased mortality in adults with tetralogy of Fallot and pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect.  ;"BACKGROUND: 22q11.2 Deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) is common in patients with tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) or pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect (PA/VSD) and is associated with worse outcomes in children. Whether this impaired prognosis is also translated into adulthood is unknown, as data in adult patients are limited. We aimed to compare long-term outcomes in adults with TOF or PA/VSD both with and without 22q11.2DS. METHODS: This study prospectively followed a nationwide multicenter cohort of TOF or PA/VSD patients with genetically confirmed presence or absence of 22q11.2DS, from inclusion in the Dutch national CONCOR registry for adults with congenital heart disease (CHD) onward. Outcome measures included all-cause mortality, cardiac mortality, need for pulmonary valve replacement (PVR), ventricular arrhythmias (VA), pacemaker implantation, and ICD implantation. RESULTS: In total, 479 patients were included (277 (58%) male, median age 28 [IQR; 21-37] years, 62 (13%) with PA/VSD, 34 (7%) with 22q11.2DS). During a median follow-up of 11 [IQR; 6-13] years, 52 (11%) patients died (8 with 22q11.2DS and 44 without 22q11.2DS). Patients with 22q11.2DS had significant decreased survival after 12 years (76% [95% CI; 62-93]) compared to patients without 22q11.2DS (89% [95% CI; 86-92], p = 0.008). 22q11.2DS was associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality and cardiac-mortality, independent of age, sex, and PA/VSD. No association was found between 22q11.2DS and late complications i.e. PVR, VA, pacemaker, or ICD implantation. CONCLUSIONS: Adults with TOF or PA/VSD with 22q11.2DS have a significantly worse survival than adults without this deletion. In patients with TOF or PA/VSD, genetic analysis for the presence of 22q11.2DS is important for risk stratification and genetic counseling.  "
Outcomes of Left Ventricular Assist Device Implantation in Patients With Uncommon Etiology Cardiomyopathy.  ;"The impact of uncommon etiology cardiomyopathies on Left-ventricular assist device (LVAD)-recipient outcomes is not very well known. This study aimed to characterize patients with uncommon cardiomyopathy etiologies and examine the outcomes between uncommon and ischemic/idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. This observational study was conducted in 19 centers between 2006 and 2016. Baseline characteristics and outcomes of patients with uncommon etiology were compared to patients with idiopathic dilated/ischemic cardiomyopathies. Among 652 LVAD-recipients included, a total of 590 (90.5%) patients were classified as ischemic/idiopathic and 62 (9.5%) patients were classified in the ""uncommon etiologies"" group. Main uncommon etiologies were: hypertrophic (n = 12(19%)); cancer therapeutics-related cardiac dysfunction (CTRCD) (n = 12(19%)); myocarditis (n = 11(18%)); valvulopathy (n = 9(15%)) and others (n = 18(29%)). Patients with uncommon etiologies were significantly younger with more female and presented less co-morbidities. Additionally, patients with uncommon cardiomyopathies were less implanted as destination therapy compared with ischemic/idiopathic group (29% vs 38.8%). During a follow-up period of 9.1 months, both groups experienced similar survival. However, subgroup of hypertrophic/valvular cardiomyopathies and CTRCD had significantly higher mortality compared to the ischemic/idiopathic or myocarditis/others cardiomyopathies. Conversely, patients with myocarditis/others etiologies experienced a better survival. Indeed, the 12-months survival in the myocarditis/others; ischemic/idiopathic and hypertrophic/CTRCD/valvulopathy group were 77%; 65%, and 46% respectively. In conclusion, LVAD-recipients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, valvular heart disease and CTRCD experienced the higher mortality rate.  "

Features of Sitosterolemia in Children.  ;Sitosterolemia is a rare lipid metabolism disease with heterogeneous manifestations. Atherosclerosis can occur in children, and therefore, early detection, diagnosis, and treatment of this disease are important. We studied 18 pediatric patients with sitosterolemia who showed a significant increase in plasma lipid levels and analyzed their clinical, biochemical, and genetic characteristics. We recorded the initial serum lipid results and clinical manifestations of the patients. Lipid and plant sterol levels were measured after homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations of ABCG5 or ABCG8 were identified by genetic testing. Plasma plant sterol levels were analyzed by gas chromatography. Fourteen cases of sitosterolemia were examined by ultrasound and echocardiography. The initial total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein levels of the children were significantly increased, but then markedly decreased after diet control or drug treatment, and even reached normal levels. Carotid atherosclerosis and aortic valve regurgitation were present in three of 14 patients. Serum lipid levels of children with sitosterolemia and xanthomas were notably higher than those without xanthomas. There were no significant differences in clinical manifestations between patients with different genotypes. In conclusion, sitosterolemia should be considered in children with hyperlipidemia who do not present with xanthomas, especially with a significant increase in total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein levels. There does not appear to be a correlation between clinical phenotype and genotype.  
Acute Mitral Regurgitation and Transcatheter Mitral Valve Repair in an Emergency Case: Focus on the Mechanical Disorder of Mitral Valve Complex.  ;Acute mitral regurgitation is an uncommon, challenging disease that requires emergent care and proper management. To evaluate its etiology, echocardiography is essential. However, echocardiography findings in these patients are often different from that of chronic mitral regurgitation owing to the acute elevation of left atrial and pulmonary artery pressure derived from the small left ventricle and atrium with low compliance. Although surgical correction is usually required owing to the hemodynamic instability, many patients are considered to be at high surgical risk. Transcatheter mitral valve repair using MitraClip (Abbott Vascular, Santa Clara, CA) may be a solution as a bail-out therapy.  
Intentional bioprosthetic tricuspid valve fracture to facilitate transcatheter valve-in-valve deployment.  ;While transcatheter valve-in-valve (ViV) implantation may reduce the number of lifetime surgical reinterventions in some patients with congenital heart disease, in other patients the bioprosthetic valve ring can lead to patient-prosthesis mismatch due to reduction of internal diameter if a transcatheter valve is implanted. A 49-year-old woman with multiple prior cardiac surgeries presented with heart failure due to bioprosthetic tricuspid valve stenosis. Initial predilation valvuloplasty suggested conventional ViV implant would produce patient-prosthesis mismatch, therefore, we intentionally fractured the bioprosthetic valve ring to facilitate optimal hemodynamics with implantation of a 29 mm transcatheter valve.

Predictors of Long-Term Outcome of Isolated Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement in Aortic Regurgitation With Reduced Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction and Extreme Left Ventricular Dilatation.  ;The management of severe aortic regurgitation (AR) in patients with reduced left ventricular function and extreme left ventricular dilatation presents a therapeutic dilemma. This study aims to assess risk factors of aortic valve replacement (AVR) for these particular population based on its performances. Two hundred twelve severe AR patients accompanied by left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <50% and left ventricular end-diastolic dimension (LVEDD) ≥70 mm who underwent isolated AVR between January 2007 and December 2016 were identified retrospectively. Logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic were used to analyze prognostic indicators for in-hospital mortality while Kaplan-Meier analysis for long-term survival. Mean age was 56 ± 13 years with mean LVEF 40 ± 7% and LVEDD 78 ± 6 mm. In-hospital mortality rate was 7%, and survival rates at 5 and 10 years were 88 ± 4% and 73 ± 10%, respectively. Logistic regression analysis indicated in-hospital mortality was associated with preoperative age and LVEF. Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed LVEF = 35% was the best cut-off value at which to predict in-hospital death. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed patients with markedly reduced LV function (LVEF <35%) had lower survival rates compared with other patients with moderate LV dysfunction (LVEF 36% to 50%) (1-, 5-, and 10-year: 90 ± 4%, 64 ± 7%, and 55 ± 14%, vs 97 ± 1%, 94 ± 3%, and 76 ± 7%, p <0.001). An age-matched analysis showed similar trend (p = 0.020). In Conclusion, AVR may be unsafe for severe AR patients with markedly reduced LV function (LVEF <35%) and extreme left ventricular dilatation (LVEDD >70 mm) due to poor postoperative early- and long-term outcomes.

Tricuspid Intervention Following Pulmonary Valve Replacement in Adults With Congenital Heart Disease.  ;"BACKGROUND: Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is common among adults with corrected tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) or pulmonary stenosis (PS) referred for pulmonary valve replacement (PVR). Yet, combined valve surgery remains controversial. OBJECTIVES: This study sought to evaluate the impact of concomitant tricuspid valve intervention (TVI) on post-operative TR, length of hospital stay, and on a composite endpoint consisting of 7 early adverse events (death, reintervention, cardiac electronic device implantation, infection, thromboembolic event, hemodialysis, and readmission). METHODS: The national Canadian cohort enrolled 542 patients with TOF or PS and mild to severe TR who underwent isolated PVR (66.8%) or PVR+TVI (33.2%). Outcomes were abstracted from charts and compared between groups using multivariable logistic and negative binomial regression. RESULTS: Median age at reintervention was 35.3 years. Regardless of surgery type, TR decreased by at least 1 echocardiographic grade in 35.4%, 66.9%, and 92.8% of patients with pre-operative mild, moderate, and severe insufficiency. In multivariable analyses, PVR+TVI was associated with an additional 2.3-fold reduction in TR grade (odds ratio [OR]: 0.44; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.25 to 0.77) without an increase in early adverse events (OR: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.46 to 1.57) or hospitalization time (incidence rate ratio: 1.17; 95% CI: 0.93 to 1.46). Pre-operative TR severity and presence of transvalvular leads independently predicted post-operative TR. In contrast, early adverse events were strongly associated with atrial tachyarrhythmia, extracardiac arteriopathy, and a high body mass index. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with TOF or PS and significant TR, concomitant TVI is safe and results in better early tricuspid valve competence than isolated PVR.  "
Septal Myectomy and Concomitant Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting for Patients With Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy and Coronary Artery Disease.  ;"Severe coronary artery disease is associated with disproportionately increased risks of death in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. There is a paucity of data on the long-term effect of coronary revascularization at the time of myectomy. Between January 1, 1961, and October 31, 2017, 2913 adult patients underwent transaortic septal myectomy at Mayo Clinic. Concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) was performed in 246 (8.4%). We compared baseline characteristics of patients who underwent septal myectomy with and without CABG and assessed the effect of surgical revascularization on the risk of all-cause mortality. Patients who underwent concomitant CABG were older (median [interquartile range], 66.3 [59.8-72.1] years vs 54.4 [43.5-64.8] years; P<.0001) and more likely to be male (63.0% vs 54.2%; P=.008) than those who did not undergo coronary revascularization at operation. There was no significant difference in preoperative left ventricular outflow tract gradients (55 [25-81] mm Hg vs 58 [25-88] mm Hg; P=.116). Overall operative mortality (≤30 days after surgery) was 1.0% and higher in patients who underwent concomitant CABG (2.2% vs 0.8%; P=.048). In multivariable analysis (n=2641), factors independently associated with mortality included concomitant CABG (hazard ratio [95% CI], 1.89 [1.39-2.58]; P<.0001), older age at operation (per interquartile range increase, 2.79 [1.95-3.98]; P<.0001), atrial fibrillation (1.46 [1.11-1.92]; P=.006), diabetes (1.45 [1.04-2.04]; P=.031), higher body mass index (change from 0.95 to 0.5 quantile, 1.95 [1.46-2.59]; P<.0001), and surgery performed earlier in the study period (2.02 [1.31-3.11]; P=.001). In conclusion, obstructive coronary artery disease severe enough to prompt concomitant CABG at the time of septal myectomy is an important risk factor for late mortality.  "
Spontaneous extracranial arterial dissections in a case of patient with osteogenesis imperfecta.  ;Background: Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), also known as brittle bone disease, is an inherited disease characterized by increased bone brittleness and decreased bone mass. OI patients may also be associated with exoskeleton manifestations such as hearing loss, articular ligament laxity, and heart valve lesions. Reports of internal carotid and cerebral artery dissection related to OI patients are very rare. We present the first case of acute cerebral infarction caused by the progressive stripping of the carotid artery dissection Chinese patient with Osteogenesis imperfecta.Case: A 48-year-old Chinese male who had no prior medical history or bad habits was to admitted the hospital due to leftside temporal headache, paroxysmal right limb weakness, and prolonged blurred vision experienced for a week. After a series of tests were performed to exclude superficial temporal arteritis, the patient was diagnosed with transient ischemic attack and was given aspirin, clopidogrel and atorvastatin without further headache and blurred vision. However, he was again admitted to the emergency department the following day due to right limb weakness for 7 h that was considered acute cerebral infarction caused by left carotid artery dissection.Conclusion: The findings in this case support that internal carotid and cerebral artery dissection may be one of the complications of Osteogenesis imperfecta.  
Thirty-Day Outcomes of Transcatheter Mitral Valve Replacement for Degenerated Mitral Bioprostheses (Valve-in-Valve), Failed Surgical Rings (Valve-in-Ring), and Native Valve With Severe Mitral Annular Calcification (Valve-in-Mitral Annular Calcification) in the United States: Data From the Society of Thoracic Surgeons/American College of Cardiology/Transcatheter Valve Therapy Registry.  ;"Comment in Circ Cardiovasc Interv. 2020 Mar;13(3):e009032.

A Population-Based Study of Healthcare Resource Utilization in Patients with Mitral Valve Prolapse.  ;This study investigated differences in the utilization of healthcare services between subjects with mitral valve prolapse (MVP) and comparison subjects using data from Taiwan's National Health Insurance population-based database, 138,493 patients with MVP (study group) and 138,493 matched patients without MVP (comparison group). We calculated the utilization of healthcare services in the year 2016 for each study sample. Patients with MVP had more outpatient cardiological services during the year (5.3 vs. 0.7, p < 0.001) and higher outpatient cardiology costs (US$226.0 vs. US$30.8, p < 0.001) than patients without MVP. As expected, patients with MVP had a longer inpatient stay (0.5 vs. 0.1, p < 0.001) and higher inpatients costs (US$158.0 vs. US$22.9, p < 0.001) than patients without MVP for cardiology services. Furthermore, patients with MVP also had more outpatient non-cardiology services (20.8 vs. 16.5, p < 0.001) and associated costs (US$708.3 vs. US$518.7, p < 0.001) than patients without MVP in the year 2016. Multiple regression analysis indicated that patients with MVP had higher total costs for all healthcare services than patients without MVP after adjusting for the urbanization level, monthly income, and geographic region. This study demonstrated that healthcare utilization by patients with MVP is substantially higher than comparison patients. Future studies are encouraged to explore MVP treatment with less expensive modalities while maintaining care quality and without jeopardizing patient outcomes.  
[Clinical features of 9 cases of Brucella endocarditis].  ;Objective: To explore the clinical characteristics of patients with Brucella endocarditis. Methods: The clinical data of 9 patients with Brucella endocarditis admitted to Beijing Ditan Hospital from October 2008 to August 2018 were retrospectively analyzed. Through the electronic medical record system of the hospital. Through assessing the electronic medical record system of the hospital, demographic data, main symptoms, vital signs, blood culture, Rose Bengal Plate Agglutination Test, echocardiography, electrocardiogram, chest imaging and other clinical data of included patients were inquired and recorded. Patients were followed up by telephone for medication, operation and outcome. Results: The 9 patients were all Han nationality, aged from 25 to 66 years, 7 out of 9 patients were male, and they came from Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia and Beijing. Of the 9 patients, 5 were farmers, 2 were self-employed, 1 was a technician, and 1 was unemployed. Of the 9 cases, 8 had a history of close contact with cattle and sheep, and 5 had a history of eating beef and mutton. Rose-Bengal Plate Agglutination Test and blood culture were positive in all 9 patients. Aortic valve was involved in 7 out of 9 patients, mitral and tricuspid valve was involved in 1 patient, respectively, and aortic dissection occurred in 1 patient. Condition of 1 patient rapidly deteriorated after admission and finally died during hospitalization despite antibiotic therapy, the remaining patients received long-term antibiotic treatment. A total of 7 patients who underwent valve replacement were followed up. One patient died of cerebral hemorrhage 6 months after operation, and the remaining 6 patients recovered well after valve replacement. Heart failure occurred in all 9 patients, and pericardial effusion occurred in 8 patients. Electrocardiogram showed low voltage of the QRS complex in the limb in 3 cases and poor R-wave progression in V(1)-V(3) lead in 2 cases, and sinus tachycardia in 2 cases. One patient developed non-specific ST-T abnormalities. All patients had fever, 7 patients complained of weakness, and 6 patients complained of palpitations. Among the 9 patients, 7 cases had anemia, 7 patients had pneumonia, 6 had bilateral pleural effusion, 4 had thrombocytopenia. Creatinine was above normal in 4 patients, urine protein was positive in 3 patients, Delta Bilirubin was higher in 3 cases. Conclusions: Patients with Brucella endocarditis often suffer from heart failure and have severe complications. Adequate antibiotic therapy in combination with valve replacement is effective for the treatment of patients with Brucella endocarditis.  
[New transcatheter strategies for multiple pathologies: a paradigmatic clinical case].  ;Percutaneous transcatheter left atrial appendage occlusion and transcatheter mitral valve repair with the MitraClip system represent new therapeutic strategies for selected patients at high risk for both hemorrhagic and cardioembolic events or with symptomatic heart failure and moderate-to-severe mitral valve regurgitation, respectively. We report the case of an 84-year-old patient with severe degenerative mitral regurgitation hospitalized for a first episode of atrial fibrillation, angina pectoris and heart failure. The patient presented a clinical history of spontaneous cerebral bleeding, severe three-vessel coronary disease and multiple comorbidities that contraindicated a conventional surgical treatment. After an accurate clinical-instrumental evaluation, the local Heart Team indicated a combined procedure of percutaneous left atrial appendage closure and transcatheter mitral valve repair with the MitraClip system, followed by multivessel percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug-eluting stent implantation. Dual antiplatelet treatment was prescribed for 12 months after PCI.  
Haploinsufficiency of the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor HAND2 causes congenital heart defects.  ;"Congenital heart defects (CHDs) are caused by a disruption in heart morphogenesis, which is dependent, in part, on a network of transcription factors (TFs) that regulate myocardial development. Heterozygous sequence variants in the basic helix-loop-helix TF gene heart and neural crest derivatives expressed 2 (HAND2) have been reported among some patients with CHDs; however, HAND2 has not yet been established as a Mendelian disease gene. We report a 31-month-old male with unicommissural unicuspid aortic valve, moderate aortic stenosis, and mild pulmonic stenosis. Chromosome analysis revealed a normal 46,XY karyotype, and a CHD sequencing panel was negative for pathogenic variants in NKX2.5, GATA4, TBX5, and CHD7. However, chromosomal microarray (CMA) testing identified a heterozygous 546.0-kb deletion on chromosome 4q34.1 (174364195_174910239[GRCh37/hg19]) that included exons 1 and 2 of SCRG1, HAND2, and HAND2-AS1. Familial CMA testing determined that the deletion was paternally inherited, which supported a likely pathogenic classification as the proband's father had previously undergone surgery for Tetralogy of Fallot. The family history was also notable for a paternal uncle who had previously died from complications related to an unknown heart defect. Taken together, this first report of a HAND2 and HAND2-AS1 deletion in a family with CHDs strongly supports haploinsufficiency of HAND2 as an autosomal dominant cause of CHD.  "
How to diagnose heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: the HFA-PEFF diagnostic algorithm: a consensus recommendation from the Heart Failure Association (HFA) of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC).  ;"Making a firm diagnosis of chronic heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) remains a challenge. We recommend a new stepwise diagnostic process, the 'HFA-PEFF diagnostic algorithm'. Step 1 (P=Pre-test assessment) is typically performed in the ambulatory setting and includes assessment for heart failure symptoms and signs, typical clinical demographics (obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, elderly, atrial fibrillation), and diagnostic laboratory tests, electrocardiogram, and echocardiography. In the absence of overt non-cardiac causes of breathlessness, HFpEF can be suspected if there is a normal left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction, no significant heart valve disease or cardiac ischaemia, and at least one typical risk factor. Elevated natriuretic peptides support, but normal levels do not exclude a diagnosis of HFpEF. The second step (E: Echocardiography and Natriuretic Peptide Score) requires comprehensive echocardiography and is typically performed by a cardiologist. Measures include mitral annular early diastolic velocity (e'), LV filling pressure estimated using E/e', left atrial volume index, LV mass index, LV relative wall thickness, tricuspid regurgitation velocity, LV global longitudinal systolic strain, and serum natriuretic peptide levels. Major (2 points) and Minor (1 point) criteria were defined from these measures. A score ≥5 points implies definite HFpEF; ≤1 point makes HFpEF unlikely. An intermediate score (2-4 points) implies diagnostic uncertainty, in which case Step 3 (F1 : Functional testing) is recommended with echocardiographic or invasive haemodynamic exercise stress tests. Step 4 (F2 : Final aetiology) is recommended to establish a possible specific cause of HFpEF or alternative explanations. Further research is needed for a better classification of HFpEF.  "
Does Heart Valve Team Risk Assessment Predict Outcomes after Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement?  ;Consideration for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) necessitates an integrated risk assessment by members of the Heart Valve Team. The utility of the integrated risk assessment for predicting TAVR outcomes is not established. This article aims to compare the utility of the integrated risk assessment to that of the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk of Mortality (STS-PROM) score for predicting patient outcomes after TAVR. A total of 274 patients who underwent TAVR from January 2016 to August 2017 were included in this study. Patients were deemed intermediate or high risk by two surgeons on the Heart Valve Team based on an integrated risk assessment that incorporates the STS-PROM score, fragility measures, end-organ dysfunction, and surgeon evaluation. Patients were also deemed low, intermediate, or high risk based solely on their STS-PROM scores of <3%, ≥3% to <8%, and ≥8%, respectively. Differences in postoperative outcomes between intermediate- and high-risk groups as categorized by the integrated risk assessment versus STS-PROM were compared. There were no statistically significant differences in postoperative outcomes between patients who were deemed high and intermediate risk by the Heart Valve Team risk assessment. In contrast, postoperative complication rates were significantly higher in patients deemed high risk as compared with intermediate risk by STS-PROM. Integrated risk assessment by the Heart Valve Team is not superior to STS-PROM in predicting postoperative outcomes in patients undergoing TAVR.  
A Case of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement for the Treatment of Severe Aortic Stenosis with Multiple Organ Dysfunction.  ;A 77-year-old woman with extremely high risk of mortality due to severe aortic stenosis (AS) and multiple organ failure was admitted to the affiliated hospital of Jiangsu University. She did not receive regular treatment since being diagnosed with AS 17 months previously. Frequent breakout of acute left heart failure after admission, with a low ostium of the left coronary artery showed by computed tomography, the patient underwent transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Though cardiac conduction system abnormalities and a short-term elevation of pulmonary arterial pressure occurred in this patient after TAVR, she eventually recovered and her quality of life improved significantly. As the population adapted to TAVR keeps expanding, we believe this operation will play a more important role in the treatment of AS patients.  
Transcatheter Mitral Valve Replacement: State of the Art.  ;The emergence of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has segued the development of transcatheter mitral valve (MV) repair devices. Transcatheter mitral valve repair has become a well-established alternative for patients with severe primary and secondary mitral regurgitation (MR) and with a perceived surgical risk. Transcatheter mitral valve replacement (TMVR) could become a more complete form of reduction of severe MR compared to MV repair devices, albeit with significant engineering challenges and all the risks associated with a bioprosthetic heart valve. The development of TMVR devices has become prominent while companies race to become the first commercially available system. Careful consideration of design challenges should be conducted by the developmental companies to ensure successful devices. Preclinical and clinical trials have shown promising results, showcasing the feasibility of total valve replacement utilizing transcatheter procedure techniques. Further development, testing, and trials need to be conducted before TMVR can become a sensible MR treatment. This review describes design challenges and considerations along with the state of the art, involving designs in both clinical and preclinical stages.  
Recursive multiresolution convolutional neural networks for 3D aortic valve annulus planimetry.  ;PURPOSE: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is the standard of care in a large population of patients with severe symptomatic aortic valve stenosis. The sizing of TAVR devices is done from ECG-gated CT angiographic image volumes. The most crucial step of the analysis is the determination of the aortic valve annular plane. In this paper, we present a fully tridimensional recursive multiresolution convolutional neural network (CNN) to infer the location and orientation of the aortic valve annular plane. METHODS: We manually labeled 1007 ECG-gated CT volumes from 94 patients with severe degenerative aortic valve stenosis. The algorithm was implemented and trained using the TensorFlow framework (Google LLC, USA). We performed K-fold cross-validation with K = 9 groups such that CT volumes from a given patient are assigned to only one group. RESULTS: We achieved an average out-of-plane localization error of (0.7 ± 0.6) mm for the training dataset and of (0.9 ± 0.8) mm for the evaluation dataset, which is on par with other published methods and clinically insignificant. The angular orientation error was (3.9 ± 2.3)° for the training dataset and (6.4 ± 4.0)° for the evaluation dataset. For the evaluation dataset, 84.6% of evaluation image volumes had a better than 10° angular error, which is similar to expert-level accuracy. When measured in the inferred annular plane, the relative measurement error was (4.73 ± 5.32)% for the annular area and (2.46 ± 2.94)% for the annular perimeter. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed algorithm is the first application of CNN to aortic valve planimetry and achieves an accuracy on par with proposed automated methods for localization and approaches an expert-level accuracy for orientation. The method relies on no heuristic specific to the aortic valve and may be generalizable to other anatomical features.  
Contemporary trends and outcomes in aortic valve replacement in patients with end-stage liver disease.  ;OBJECTIVE: Even in high-risk trials pertaining to transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), patients with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) have been under-represented. We sought to study this population group from a large national United States population database. METHODS: We used National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database from January 2005 to August 2015. Patients with ESLD were extracted using Goldberg's algorithm. Propensity match analysis was done for comparative analysis between surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) and TAVR groups. Logistic regression analysis was used for predictors of in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Out of 309,959 ESLD patients, 1,375 underwent aortic valve replacement and 1,199 patients were included in our study. Mean age was 66.1 (SD, 9.1) years. In matched data, the in-hospital mortality was 5.5% in TAVR group when compared to 19.4% in SAVR group. Ventilator use (16.1 vs. 27.2%, p < .01), tracheostomy (<4 vs. 7.2%, p < .01), and vasopressin use (0 vs. 7.4%, p < .01) were utilized less in TAVR group as compared to SAVR group. The proportion of TAVR has increased from almost zero in 2011 to 51.3% in 2015. Mean cost for hospital stay has increased in SAVR group (from 254,427$ in 2005 to 321,791$ in 2015, p < .01). Similarly, a large decrease in length of stay has been observed for TAVR group (14.5 days in 2011 to 5.4 days in 2015, p < .01). TAVR (odds ratios [OR]: 0.42, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.20-0.87, p = .02) was associated with lower in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSION: TAVR was associated with lower in-hospital mortality, morbidity, and resource utilization in high-risk ESLD patients.  
[Clinical practice guidelines for hereditary cardiomyopathy].  ;Cardiomyopathies are a group of heterogeneous diseases which can be caused by various factors (often genetic) and can lead to heart failure, arrhythmia and sudden death. Primary cardiomyopathies includes hereditary hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, mitochondrial cardiomyopathy, mixed (hereditary and acquired) dilated cardiomyopathy and restrictive cardiomyopathy, left ventricular densification insufficiency, and other unclassified cardiomyopathies. With the help of genomic technology, common mutations in the population have been identified. In vivo and in vitro study of such mutations has provided insight into the pathogenesis and treatment of these diseases. The compilation of this guideline is based on the consensus of basic and clinical research and guidelines from other countries, and has summarized the phenotype, diagnosis, treatment and consultation of various types of genetic cardiomyopathies with an aim to standardize the clinical management of patients.  
Fatal outcome of first case of Streptococcus sinensis in infective endocarditis in the Netherlands: a case report.  ;BACKGROUND: Infective endocarditis is a relatively common disease in a cardiologist's daily practice. Nowadays more detailed information about pathogens is provided to us by diagnostics such as MALDI Biotyper Massa Spectrometer. We present a case of endocarditis lenta in which Streptococcus sinensis was identified in the Netherlands for the first time. CASE SUMMARY: A 58-year-old man was admitted with high suspicion of endocarditis lenta complicated by severe kidney dysfunction and anaemia. He was treated with penicillin and gentamycin. Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed a large vegetation at the mitral valve and MALDI Biotyper Massa Spectrometer (Microflex) revealed S. sinensis as the pathogen. The patient refused to receive blood transfusions or surgery. Due to cerebral infarction with haemorrhagic transformation, the patient died 8 days after admission. DISCUSSION: Streptococcus sinensis was described in Hong Kong for the first time and is associated with endocarditis in rheumatic heart disease. To our knowledge, this is the first case reporting a fatal outcome of endocarditis due to this bacterium in the acute phase. In this case, late discovery, disease severity, and under treatment all contributed to the poor outcome. We want to share the knowledge on the existence of this bacteria.  
Robotic mitral valve repair for rheumatic mitral stenosis and regurgitation: a case report.  ;BACKGROUND: Rheumatic mitral valve (MV) disease is the major cause of congestive cardiac failure in children and young adults, particularly in developing countries. Mitral valve repair with minimum prosthetic material is the gold standard treatment for this condition. However, MV repair for rheumatic MV disease is known to be technically demanding. CASE SUMMARY: A 27-year-old woman without a history of cardiac disease presented with dyspnoea on exertion. Echocardiography revealed rheumatic severe mitral stenosis and regurgitation, with thickening of the bileaflets, doming of the anterior leaflet, shortening of the posterior leaflet, fusions of the lateral and particularly the medial commissure, and enlargement of the mitral annulus. We successfully performed robot-assisted MV repair with bicommissural release, patch augmentation of the two leaflets, and implantation of an originally sized partial band. DISCUSSION: Robotic MV repair can contribute to precise valve inspection and operative procedures. This approach seems feasible for complex rheumatic MV disease particularly in young patients.  
Pregnancy in non-palliated functionally single ventricle: challenges of management in resource-poor settings.  ;Women with complex functionally univentricular hearts rarely survive into adulthood without corrective or palliative surgery. Reports of pregnancy outcome in this group of patients in resource-poor settings are sparse. We report a case of unrepaired pulmonary atresia ventricular septal defect (VSD) with major aorto-pulmonary collateral arteries (MAPCA) who survived into adulthood and was able to complete a successful pregnancy in a resource-poor country.  
Pulmonary Artery Systolic Pressure Response to Exercise in Patients with Rheumatic Mitral Stenosis: Determinants and Prognostic Value.  ;"BACKGROUND: Pulmonary hypertension in response to exercise is a marker of the hemodynamic severity of mitral stenosis (MS). However, the factors related to elevated pulmonary pressure with exercise are not well defined. The aim of this study was to assess the parameters associated with the pulmonary pressure response to exercise in patients with pure rheumatic MS. An additional aim was to determine the impact of exercise-induced pulmonary hypertension on clinical outcome. METHODS: One hundred thirty patients with MS (94% women; mean age, 45 ± 11 years) underwent exercise echocardiography. A range of echocardiographic parameters were obtained at rest and at peak exercise. Symptom-limited graded ramp bicycle exercise was performed in the supine position. The primary end point was mitral valve intervention, either percutaneous or surgical. RESULTS: In the overall population, systolic pulmonary artery pressure (SPAP) increased from 38.3 ± 13.4 mm Hg at rest to 65.8 ± 20.7 mm Hg during exercise. Increases in mean mitral gradient, right ventricular function, left atrial volume, and net atrioventricular compliance were independently associated with SPAP at peak exercise, after adjusting for changes in heart rate. During the follow-up period (median, 17 months; range, 1-45 months), 46 adverse clinical events were observed. By multivariate Cox proportional-hazards analysis adjusted for age and sex, SPAP achieved at peak exercise was an important predictor of adverse outcome (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.025; 95% CI, 1.010-1.040; P = .001). New York Heart Association functional class (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.459; 95% CI, 1.509-4.006; P < .001) and the interaction between valve area and net atrioventricular compliance (P = .001) were also significant predictors of adverse events. Time-dependent areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the model with SPAP during exercise were better than for the model with SPAP at rest, with a significant improvement from 3 years onward. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with MS, the pulmonary artery pressure response to exercise is determined by a combination of factors, including transmitral mean gradient at exercise, net atrioventricular compliance, left atrial volume, and right ventricular function. Pulmonary artery pressure at peak exercise is a predictor of clinical outcomes and adds incremental prognostic value beyond that provided by standard resting measurements, including valve area.  "
Intractable mechanical hemolytic anemia complicating mitral valve surgery: a case series study.  ;"BACKGROUND: Intractable, mechanical hemolytic anemia (IMHA) is a rare catastrophic complication following mitral valve surgery. We analyzed patient characteristics and IMHA management by reoperations after mitral valve surgery. METHODS: We collected medical records from mitral valve patients requiring reoperation due to IMHA. INCLUSION CRITERIA: hemoglobin < 100 g/L; positive hemolysis tests and echocardiography results; and exclusion of other hemolysis causes. RESULTS: Data from 25 IMHA cases included 10 (40%) early onset (1.3 (0.3,3.0) months) and 15 (60%) late onset (120 (24,204) months) cases. Early IMHA etiologies included surgical defects (6, 60%), uncontrolled infection (3, 30%) and Bechet's disease (1, 10%). Late IMHA etiologies included degeneration (13, 87%), new infection (1, 7%) and trauma (1, 7%). There were more mechanical valves (15, 88%) than bio-valves (2, 12%); the main valvular dysfunction was paravalvular leak (16, 64%). IMHA manifestations included jaundice (18, 72%), dark urine (21, 84%), heart failure (16, 64%), acute kidney injury (11, 44%), hepatomegaly (15, 60%), splenomegaly (15, 60%) and pancreatitis (1, 4%). Laboratory results showed decreased hemoglobin (70 ± 14 g/L) and increased bilirubin (72 ± 57 μmol/L), lactate dehydrogenase (2607 ± 2142 IU/L) and creatinine (136 ± 101 μmol/L) levels. Creatinine level negatively correlated with hemoglobin level (B = -3.33, S.E. B = 1.31, Exp(B) = 368.15, P = 0.018). Preoperative medications included iron supplements (20, 80%), erythropoietin (16, 64%) and beta-blocker (22, 88%). Two patients died of cardiac causes before reoperation. The other 23 underwent reoperation with long surgical times (aortic cross clamp 124 ± 50 min, cardiopulmonary bypass 182 ± 69 min) and blood transfusions (red blood cells 6 (6, 8) units, plasma 600 (400,800) ml, platelet 1(0,2) units). Postoperative complications included cardiac dysfunction (5, 22%), arrhythmia (10, 43%), sepsis (6, 26%), pulmonary infection (5, 22%), gastrointestinal bleeding (3, 13%), cerebral hemorrhage (2, 9%), chronic renal dysfunction (1, 4%) and surgical hemorrhage (1, 4%). Five (33%) patients died after reoperation from cardiac dysfunction (3, 60%), septic shock (1, 20%) and self-discharge (1, 20%). CONCLUSIONS: IMHA induces severe multi-organ dysfunction, contributing to high mortality. Perioperative management should focus on etiological treatment, organ protection, and blood management.  "
Statin treatment of patients with calcific aortic valve disease modulates extracellular adenosine metabolism on the cell surface of the aortic valve.  ;Statins efficiently prevent cardiovascular events by lipid-dependent and independent mechanisms. We hypothesize that part of these protective effects could be associated with an increased extracellular adenosine signaling. We demonstrated previously that aortic valves obtained from patients with calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) disclosed disturbances in extracellular adenosine metabolism. This study aimed to analyze the impact of statin treatment on extracellular nucleotides and adenosine metabolism in aortic valves originated from CAVD patients and to elucidate potential mechanisms that are involved in the regulation of ecto-enzyme activities by statins. Aortic valves of CAVD patients treated with statins (n = 45) revealed higher adenosine production and its lower degradation than in non-treated patients (n = 28). Statin treatment was also related to the improvement in pre-operative echocardiographic data indicating milder aortic valve stenosis and a better function of the left ventricle. The rates of aortic valve adenosine conversions correlated with plasma lipid profile parameters, within both statin-treated and non-treated groups. Valvular extracellular AMP hydrolysis correlated negatively, while adenosine deamination positively with plasma total and LDL cholesterol. Atorvastatin treatment of murine heart endothelial cells led to the enhanced ecto-5'nucleotidase (CD73) and decreased ecto-adenosine deaminase (eADA) activity. When endothelial cells were stimulated with thrombin that induces endothelial cell exocytosis, activities of both cell-surface CD73 and eADA were increased, while co-treatment with atorvastatin reversed only thrombin-induced eADA activity. In conclusion, early intervention with statins may provide beneficial effects for CAVD therapy. Here, we presented results showing that these protective outcomes could be mediated via the regulation of extracellular adenosine metabolism pathways.  
Surgical mitral plasticity for chronic ischemic mitral regurgitation.  ;"BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE STUDY: The outcome of mitral valve (MV) repair for chronic ischemic mitral regurgitation (IMR) is suboptimal, due to the high recurrence rate of moderate or severe mitral regurgitation (MR) during follow-up. The MV adapts to new MR increasing its area to cover the enlarged annular area (mitral plasticity). As this process is often incomplete, we aimed to evaluate if augmenting the anterior leaflet (AL) and cutting the second-order chords (CC) together with restrictive mitral annuloplasty, a strategy we call ""surgical mitral plasticity,"" could improve the midterm results of MV repair for IMR. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From November 2017 to October 2019, 22 patients with chronic IMR underwent surgical mitral plasticity. Mean age was 73 ± 7 years and six were female. Mean ejection fraction was 32% ± 11%, IMR grade was moderate in 10 and severe in 12. Mean clinical and echocardiographic follow-up was 12 ± 6 months. RESULTS: There was no early death, and one patient died 6 months after surgery. Ejection fraction improved from 32% ± 15% to 40% ± 6% (P = .031). IMR was absent or mild in all patients, and none showed recurrent moderate or more IMR. Tenting area decreased significantly from 2.5 ± 0.5 to 0.5 ± 0.3 cm² and coaptation length increased from 1.9 ± 0.7 to 7.8 ± 1.6 mm. All patients were in New York Heart Association class I or II. CONCLUSIONS: Mitral plasticity, if uncomplete, is ineffective in preventing IMR to become significant. Surgical mitral plasticity, by completing incomplete process of MV adaptation, has a strong rationale, which however needs to be validated with longer follow-up.  "
Model-based estimation of left ventricular pressure and myocardial work in aortic stenosis.  ;This paper proposes a model-based estimation of left ventricular (LV) pressure for the evaluation of constructive and wasted myocardial work of patients with aortic stenosis (AS). A model of the cardiovascular system is proposed, including descriptions of i) cardiac electrical activity, ii) elastance-based cardiac cavities, iii) systemic and pulmonary circulations and iv) heart valves. After a sensitivity analysis of model parameters, an identification strategy was implemented using a Monte-Carlo cross-validation approach. Parameter identification procedure consists in two steps for the estimation of LV pressures: step 1) from invasive, intraventricular measurements and step 2) from non-invasive data. The proposed approach was validated on data obtained from 12 patients with AS. The total relative errors between estimated and measured pressures were on average 11.9% and 12.27% and mean R2 were equal to 0.96 and 0.91, respectively for steps 1 and 2 of parameter identification strategy. Using LV pressures obtained from non-invasive measurements (step 2) and patient-specific simulations, Global Constructive (GCW), Wasted (GWW) myocardial Work and Global Work Efficiency (GWE) parameters were calculated. Correlations between measures and model-based estimations were 0.88, 0.80, 0.91 respectively for GCW, GWW and GWE. The main contributions concern the proposal of the parameter identification procedure, applied on an integrated cardiovascular model, able to reproduce LV pressure specifically to each AS patient, by non-invasive procedures, as well as a new method for the non-invasive estimation of constructive, wasted myocardial work and work efficiency in AS.  
Critical coronary artery ostial narrowing and sudden death.  ;Coronary ostial stenosis is an uncommon lesion but one that may be associated with significant and potentially lethal reduction in distal artery blood flow. While most commonly due to atherosclerosis, it may also be caused by aortic arteritis, congenital webs or post-surgical complications following aortic valve replacement. Three cases of lethal ischemic heart disease are reported where occult ostial narrowing/occlusion was first identified at autopsy. Case 1: A 70-year-old man with hypoplasia of the right coronary artery and tunneling of the left anterior descending coronary artery had atherosclerotic obliteration of the right coronary artery ostium. Cases 2 & 3: Two men (aged 80 and 85 years respectively) with marked epicardial coronary artery atherosclerosis also had associated atherosclerotic obliteration of their right coronary artery ostia. Examination of the coronary ostia is an important part of the forensic assessment in cases of sudden death, as isolated occlusive lesions may be the only explanation for a lethal episode. In other cases, as in those reported herein, ostial stenosis/occlusion may be an additional contributing factor to global myocardial ischemia from coronary artery atheroma and/or other causes.  
Ischemic mitral regurgitation: problem extent in cardiovascular surgery clinic.  ;"OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate the prevalence, etiology, mechanisms and severety of all cases of MR, including IMR, in the patients population with suspected or proved CAD before coronary arteries evaluation and surgery or intervention. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Materials and methods: The study prospectively included 370 patients with verified or suspected (angina pectoris suspicion or manifested CHF) CAD of all clinical forms (stable, unstable, post-AMI, prior revascularization, etc.). MR evaluation by TTE included examining type of MR (organic or functional, Carpentier type) and its severity by vena contracta (VC) width and establishing effective regurgitant orifice (ERO) and regurgitant volume (RVol) by PISA method according to existing guidelines. Additional criteria (left atrium (LA) dimensions, LV diastolic filling and filling pressure markers, pulmonary veins flow and secondary pulmonary hypertension and right chambers involvement, etc.) were also widely used. RESULTS: Results: Majority of all patients were men - 280 out of 370 pts (75.7%). Mean age of pts was 62.4±8.96 years, and men were in general significantly younger (61.5±9.2 vs. 65.3±7.6 years, p=0.0004). 145 (39.2%) pts had verified AMI previously (126 men and 19 women, p<0.0001). 22 (5.95%) pts previously underwent CABG surgery (19 men and 3 women, p<0.0001), and 99 patients - PCI with coronary stenting (81 men and 18 women, p<0.0001). 42 (11.3%) pts proved to have no significant CAD as per CAG results: 24 (57.1%) pts had no significant cardiac pathology at all, 12 (28.6%) pts had uncomplicated essential hypertension, 5 (11.9%) pts had non-coronary dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and 1 (2.4%) pt had non-obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCP) with clean coronary arteries. In patients with CAD MR is a frequent finding (up to one-half of the studied population) regardless of gender. Predominant majority (84.1%) of MR according to TTE findings is mild (grade I), without significant influence upon heart load and remodeling, and, thus, requiring no additional surgeon interventions. Most of cases of such pathological MR resolved after myocardial revascularization or sustained without dynamics being physiological (13.2% of all MR cases). Most of moderate-to-severe MR cases were classified as IMR, being accompanied by appropriate LV remodeling features, requiring revascularization and/or mitral valvuloplasty or replacement (all cases of severe IMR or organic MR). Correlations results of MR ERO and RVol with certain heart chambers remodeling and load indices seem to make them a ""gold standard"" for MR severity evaluation, especially in CAD patients with potential indications for MV surgery that should accompany surgeon revascularization, as it is widely accepted today. CONCLUSION: Conclusions: In the patients with various forms of chronic and acute CAD IMR is a frequent finding, but the majority of MR cases are mild and requiring no additional interventions. No gender difference in MR prevalence were found. Severe MR cases in all CAD patients population are rather rare (below 10%), but always require surgical repair. Moderate-to-severe IMR is the most frequent (approximately 75%) etiology for significant MR in CAD patients, requiring close TTE follow-up for optimal intervention timing on the basis of left and right chambers remodeling and load indices. MR ERO and RVol are trustworthy quantitative MR severity indices, significantly correlating with main LV and LA remodeling and load indices, as well as with some secondary right chambers overload predictors.

Early outcomes of mitral valvuloplasty by minimally invasive surgery or sternotomy.  ;BACKGROUND: Disagreement exists regarding methods for repair of the mitral valve. We compared early outcomes of mitral valvuloplasty by a minimally invasive technique and by a median sternotomy. METHODS: The data of 507 patients (mean age 47.9 ± 15.2 years) undergoing mitral valvuloplasty from January 2015 to June 2018 were analyzed retrospectively. In the study group (n = 225), mitral valvuloplasty via a totally thoracoscopic approach was performed by a single surgeon. In the control group (n = 282), mitral valvuloplasty via the traditional median sternotomy was carried out by other cardiac surgeons in our hospital. Clinical data, surgical results, and follow-up findings in the two groups were comparatively analyzed. RESULTS: In the study group, the blood transfusion rate (5.3% vs. 20.9%, p < 0.05) and incidences of poor wound healing (0 vs. 5.3%, p < 0.05) and respiratory tract infection (4.4% vs. 16.3%, p < 0.05) were lower, and postoperative hospitalization was shorter (5.9 ± 4.0 vs. 10.7 ± 8.4 days, p < 0.05). Within 30 days after surgery, no patient died in the study group while one died in the control group. The duration of follow-up was 12-36 months (mean 22.9 ± 8.8 months). During follow-up, there were 1 and 0 cases of redo surgery and 1 and 3 deaths in the study group and control group, respectively. CONCLUSION: Mitral valvuloplasty via a minimally invasive approach is superior to the traditional median sternotomy in terms of early outcomes, especially when performed by experienced surgeons.  
Current and Future Aspects of Multimodal Imaging, Diagnostic, and Treatment Strategies in Bicuspid Aortic Valve and Associated Aortopathies.  ;Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is the most frequent congenital cardiac abnormality leading to premature aortic valve apparatus dysfunction and is often associated with aortopathy. Therefore, current guidelines recommend a surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR), even if many patients are deemed inoperable owing to their comorbidities and require alternatives such as transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). However, BAV variations remain challenging for procedural success. Therefore, the latest development in different imaging modalities (echocardiography, multislice-computertomographie, cardiovascular magnetic resonance) allows in-depth analysis for preprocedural risk stratification, follow up, and patient selection. Furthermore, we shed light on the latest developments in pre- and periprocedural fusion imaging as well as on current and future treatment options.

New perspectives by imaging modalities for an old illness: Rheumatic mitral stenosis.  ;Mitral stenosis (MS) is a progressive and devastating disease and most often occurs among young women. Given its considerable prevalence in Mediterranean and Eastern European countries according to the Euro Heart Survey, new imaging modalities are warranted to improve the management of patients with this condition. A wide spectrum of abnormalities occurs involving all parts of this complex structure and causing different grades of MS and/or regurgitation as a consequence of rheumatic affection. Novel imaging modalities significantly improved the assessment of several aspects of this rheumatic destructive process including the morphological alterations of the mitral valve apparatus, left atrial (LA) function, LA appendage, right and left ventricular function, and complications, namely, atrial fibrillation and thromboembolic events. Furthermore, new imaging modalities improved the prediction of outcome of patients who underwent percutaneous balloon mitral comissurotomy and changed the paradigm of patient selection for intervention and risk stratification. The present review aimed to summarize the role of new multimodality, multiparametric imaging approaches to assess the morphological characteristics of the rheumatic MS and its associated complications, and to guide patient management.  
Impact of epicardial adipose tissue volume upon left ventricular dysfunction in patients with mild-to-moderate aortic stenosis: A post-hoc analysis.  ;"BACKGROUND: Aortic stenosis (AS) may lead to diastolic dysfunction and later on heart failure (HF) with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (HFpEF) via increased afterload and left-ventricular (LV) hypertrophy. Since epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) is a metabolically active fat depot that is adjacent to the myocardium and can influence cardiomyocytes and LV function via secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, we hypothesized that high amounts of EAT, as assessed by computed tomography (CT), may aggravate the development and severity of LV hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction in the context of AS. METHODS: We studied 50 patients (mean age 71 ± 9 years; 9 women) in this preliminary study with mild or moderate AS and mild to severe LV diastolic dysfunction (LVDD), diagnosed by echocardiography, who underwent non-contrast cardiac CT and echocardiography. EAT parameters were measured on 2nd generation dual source CT. Conventional two-dimensional echocardiography and Tissue Doppler Imaging (TDI) was performed to assess LV function and to derive myocardial straining parameter. All patients had a preserved LV ejection fraction > 50%. Data was analysed using Pearson's correlation. RESULTS: Only weak correlation was found between EAT volume or density and E/é ratio as LVDD marker (r = -.113 p = .433 and r = .260, p = .068 respectively). Also, EAT volume or density were independent from Global Strain Parameters (r = 0.058 p = .688 and r = -0.207 p = .239). E/é ratio was strongly associated with LVDD (r = .761 p≤0.0001) and Strain Parameters were moderately associated with LV Ejection Fraction (r = -.669 p≤0.001 and r = -.454 P≤0.005). CONCLUSIONS: In this preliminary study in patients with AS, the EAT volume and density as assessed by CT correlated only weakly with LVDD, as expressed by the commonly used E/é ratio, and with LV strain function. Hence, measuring EAT volume and density may neither contribute to the prediction nor upon the severity of LVDD, respectively.  "
The short-term and long-term outcomes of transcatheter or surgical aortic valve replacement in elderly patients: A protocol for a systematic review.  ;BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has become an essential alternate option for people suffering from aortic stenosis. However, the efficacy and safety of TAVR for elderly population (aged over 80 years) is still unclear. METHODS: We plan to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical controlled trials and propensity-match cohort studies to evaluate the short- and long-term outcomes in elderly aortic stenosis patients who undergo a transcatheter or surgical aortic valve replacement. We will search PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library using a comprehensive strategy. The related conference proceedings and reference lists of the included studies will also be checked to identify additional studies. Two reviewers will screen retrieved records, extract information, and assess the risk of bias independently. STATA software will be used to conduct data synthesis. There is no requirement of ethical approval and informed consent. RESULTS: This study will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal for publication. CONCLUSION: This is the first systematic assessment of TAVR for elderly patients with aortic stenosis. We hope it will provide a relatively comprehensive reference for clinical practice and future relevant clinical trials. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval and patient consent are not required as this study is a systematic review and meta-analysis. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42019140857. STUDY PROTOCOL REGISTRY: The protocol has been registered in PROSPERO, which is an International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews. The registration number is CRD42019140857.

Various treatments are available, each with its own limitations. Here, we present a case in which all forms of therapy failed except sympathectomy, which terminated the storm successfully.  
Transseptal Approach for Mitral Valve Replacement in Dextrocardia with Situs Inversus Totalis: A Case Report and Review of the Literature.  ;We consider mitral valve disease requiring surgery in a patient with dextrocardia and situs inversus totalis to be an exceptional finding. The transseptal approach for mitral valve surgery in dextrocardia represents a technical challenge owing to its anatomic particulars. We present the case of a 56-year-old female patient who had been diagnosed with situs inversus totalis in childhood and with chronic atrial fibrillation in adulthood and was under oral anticoagulant treatment. She was referred to our hospital for increasing dyspnea and palpitation. Transthoracic echocardiography detected severe mitral regurgitation associated with moderate tricuspid regurgitation, with normal left and right ventricular function. Contrast chest computed tomography (CT) and preoperative abdominal CT showed both dextrocardia and situs inversus totalis, with normal continuity of the inferior vena cava. Biatrial cannulation was performed with the surgeon standing on the right side of the patient, and mitral valve replacement using a transseptal approach was performed with the surgeon standing on the left side of the patient. In this case report, we emphasize the rarity of mitral valve disease in a patient with dextrocardia and the inherent potential difficulty that can appear in this particular anatomic condition.

"Ross operation 23 years after surgery: It should not be a ""forgotten"" option.  ";"INTRODUCTION: The Ross procedure plays a pivotal part in both congenital and acquired diseases of the aortic valve, especially in young patients. The advantages of this procedure are widely known; however, long-term studies have shown dilation of the pulmonary autograft (PA) in up to 20% of patients in the second decade postoperatively. METHODS: Three cases (ages 38, 51, and 53) who underwent the Ross procedure 23 years ago for bicuspid valves and endocarditis. Cases were followed-up with echocardiogram and computed tomography scan with three-dimensional reconstructions. RESULTS: The PA showed normal function with favorable geometry alongside the thoracic aorta, while the pulmonary homograft preserved its function with a low degree of calcification. The mean annual expansion of the autograft was only 0.15, 0.30, and 0.40 mm with no pathological dilation after 20 years DISCUSSION: Ross operation provides excellent hemodynamic results while avoiding long-term anticoagulation and might constitute a valid adjunct in selected categories such as young or endocarditis patients.

Effect of oral anticoagulation on clinical outcomes and haemodynamic variables after successful transcatheter aortic valve implantation.  ;"BACKGROUND: The effect of oral anticoagulation on clinical and haemodynamic outcomes following successful transcatheter aortic valve implantation is unclear. AIMS: To evaluate the effect of oral anticoagulation within the first year after transcatheter aortic valve implantation. METHODS: All patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation in two French tertiary centres from 2010 to 2016 were included prospectively. The composite outcome of death, stroke, readmission for heart failure or major/life-threatening bleeding according to Valve Academic Research Consortium 2 criteria within 1year was evaluated. Valvular haemodynamic deterioration was defined as mean transprosthetic gradient ≥20mmHg or an increase of ≥10mmHg during echocardiographic follow-up. RESULTS: Of the 1139 patients included, 400 (35.1%) were discharged on oral anticoagulation. The primary endpoint was more frequent in the group with versus without oral anticoagulation (29.4% vs. 17.3% 21.5%; hazard ratio 1.83, 95% confidence interval 1.42-2.35). Composite endpoint risk factors were chronic pulmonary and kidney diseases, previous atrial fibrillation, left ventricular ejection fraction ≤30% at discharge and no femoral vascular approach, but not oral anticoagulation prescription at discharge. Conversely, 58 patients were identified with valvular haemodynamic deterioration, including 11 (19%) in the group with oral anticoagulation and 47 (81%) in the group without oral anticoagulation. Valvular haemodynamic deterioration risk factors were absence of oral anticoagulation exposure, increased body mass index, use of a balloon-expandable bioprosthesis and use of a bioprosthesis with diameter ≤23mm. Antithrombotic treatment crossover (i.e. oral anticoagulation interruption or introduction during follow-up) occurred in 9.6% of patients, and was a risk factor for death (adjusted hazard ratio 3.39, 95% confidence interval 1.63-7.07). CONCLUSIONS: Baseline characteristics, rather than oral anticoagulation prescription at discharge, were associated with adverse outcomes following successful transcatheter aortic valve implantation. Conversely, oral anticoagulation was associated with reduced valvular haemodynamic deterioration.  "

TAVI in Patients with Mitral Annular Calcification and/or Mitral Stenosis.  ;"BACKGROUND:  We herein aimed for analysis of influence of mitral annular calcification (MAC) and mitral stenosis (MS) on outcomes in transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). METHODS:  Between 11/2009 and 06/2017, 1,058 patients underwent TAVI in the presence of concomitant MAC or MS at our center. Subgroups were built and multivariate logistic regression, COX regression, Kaplan-Meier survival analyses, and receiver operating characteristics method were performed. RESULTS:  Thirty-day mortality was 7.5% (79/1,058) with highest mortality in patients severe MS (MAC: 3.4% vs. mild MS: 5.9% vs. moderate MS: 15.0% vs. severe MS: 72.7%; p < 0.001). Moderate-to-severe MS (odds ratio [OR]: 7.75, confidence interval [CI]: 3.94-16.26, p < 0.001), impaired left ventricular ejection fraction (OR: 1.38, CI: 1.10-1.72, p < 0.01), and coronary artery disease (OR: 1.36, CI: 1.11-1.67, p < 0.01) were predictive of 30-day survival. Left ventricular systolic/end-diastolic pressure drop of <59.5 mm Hg / <19.5 mm Hg was associated with increased mortality. CONCLUSIONS:  TAVI in the presence of MAC and mild MS is associated with acceptable acute outcomes but should be considered high-risk procedures in patients with moderate and especially those with severe MS. Our results suggest adverse hemodynamics after TAVI with concomitant MS, which may be caused by underfilling of the left ventricle leading to low-cardiac output.  "
Contemporary issues in severe aortic stenosis: review of current and future strategies from the Contemporary Outcomes after Surgery and Medical Treatment in Patients with Severe Aortic Stenosis registry.  ;Contemporary Outcomes after Surgery and Medical Treatment in Patients with Severe Aortic Stenosis (CURRENT AS) registry was a large Japanese multicentre retrospective registry of consecutive patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) before introduction of transcatheter aortic valve implantation. We sought to overview the data from the CURRENT AS registry to discuss the three major contemporary issues related to clinical practice in patients with severe AS: (1) under-referral/underuse of surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in symptomatic patients with severe AS, (2) management of asymptomatic patients with severe AS and (3) management of patients with low-gradient severe aortic stenosis (LG-AS). First, despite the dismal prognosis of symptomatic patients with severe AS, SAVR, including those performed during follow-up, was reported to be underused. In the CURRENT AS registry, overall 53% of symptomatic patients underwent aortic valve replacement (AVR) during follow-up. Second, we reported that compared with conservative strategy, initial AVR strategy was associated with lower risk of all-cause death and heart failure hospitalisation in asymptomatic patients with severe AS. Although current recommendations for AVR are mainly dependent on the patient symptoms, some patients may not complain of any symptom because of their sedentary lifestyle. We also reported several important objective factors associated with worse clinical outcomes in asymptomatic patients with severe AS for risk stratification. Finally, initial AVR strategy was associated with better long-term clinical outcomes than conservative strategy in both patients with high-gradient AS and patients with LG-AS. The favourable effect of initial AVR strategy was also seen in patients with LG-AS with left ventricular ejection fraction of ≥50%.  
Postcardiotomy extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in a patient with Austrian syndrome.  ;A 43-year-old man with Austrian syndrome, the triad of infective endocarditis (IE), pneumonia and meningitis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, underwent emergency aortic and mitral valve replacement and closure of an aortic root abscess. Postoperatively, he required mechanical circulatory support with veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and an intra-aortic balloon pump. Several days after surgery, new mitral and aortic paraprosthetic leaks (PPLs) developed. These were managed conservatively, initially, but eventually required percutaneous closure 6 weeks after the initial operation. This has enabled the patient to recover to independent mobility, 20 weeks after the operation. This case illustrates a rare clinical syndrome and the devastating impact of IE. Moreover, it illustrates the successful application of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in postcardiotomy cardiac failure and the successful treatment of PPL in a patient unfit for redo surgery.

This review describes the rationale, selection criteria, technical features, and current outcomes for the three most commonly performed FCI: fetal aortic stenosis with evolving hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS); HLHS with intact or restrictive atrial septum; and pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum, with concern for worsening right ventricular (RV) hypoplasia.

Durability of transcatheter aortic valve implantation: A translational review.  ;Until recently, transcatheter aortic valve implantation was restricted to high-risk and inoperable patients. The updated 2017 European Society of Cardiology Guidelines has widened the indication to include intermediate-risk patients, based on two recently published trials (PARTNER 2 and SURTAVI). Moreover, two other recent trials (PARTNER 3 and EVOLUT LOW RISK) have demonstrated similar results with transcatheter aortic valve implantation in low-risk patients. Thus, extension of transcatheter aortic valve implantation to younger patients, who are currently treated by surgical aortic valve replacement, raises the crucial question of bioprosthesis durability. In this translational review, we propose to produce a state-of-the-art overview of the durability of transcatheter aortic valve implantation by integrating knowledge of the basic science of bioprosthesis degeneration (pathophysiology and biomarkers). After summarising the new definition of structural valve deterioration, we will present what is known about the pathophysiology of aortic stenosis and bioprosthesis degeneration. Next, we will consider how to identify a population at risk of early degeneration, and how basic science with the help of biomarkers could identify and predict structural valve deterioration. Finally, we will present data on the differences in durability of transcatheter aortic valve implantation compared with surgical aortic valve replacement.  
Neonatal Pulmonary Atresia With Intact Ventricular Septum-8-Year Surgical Experience at One Center.  ;BACKGROUND: Surgical treatment of pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum (PA/IVS) in neonates is challenging because of the broad variations of right ventricular (RV) malformations. In this retrospective study, we summarized our 8-y experience in surgical management for neonatal PA/IVS patients. METHODS: Thirty-four neonates with PA/IVS between July 1, 2006 and June 30, 2014, were reviewed. Patients were categorized into three groups: mild, moderate, and severe RV hypoplasia according to RV morphology and development. Patients were on regular follow-up for at least 5 y. Overall survival, complications, reinterventions, risk factors for mortality, and health status were evaluated. RESULTS: 21 patients (61.8%) were treated with biventricular repair, eight patients (23.5%) with Fontan procedure, and one patient (2.9%) with bidirectional Glenn procedure. There were four postprocedural mortalities and one late death. The 5-y survival rates after final surgical repair for mild, moderate, and severe RV hypoplasia groups were 100%, 100%, and 88.9%, respectively. The reintervention rates were 0% (0/4), 21.4% (3/14), and 55.6% (5/9) for the subgroups, respectively. At the latest follow-up, most patients had a status characterized as New York Heart Association class I (88.9%, 24/27). CONCLUSIONS: Surgical management for PA/IVS in neonates should be individualized. Favorable early and long-term outcomes can be achieved in neonatal PA/IVS patients by individualized surgical strategies, regardless of the degree of RV hypoplasia. In spite of potential RV catch-up development, the degree of RV hypoplasia is a factor of paramount importance to assess PA/IVS in neonates.  
Late Presentation of a Congenitally Corrected Transposition of Great Arteries and Hemodynamically Balanced Ventricles Associated with a Large Ventricular Septal Defect and Severe Pulmonary Stenosis: A Case Report and a Multi-Imaging Approach.  ;BACKGROUND Congenitally corrected transposition of great arteries (ccTGA) represents a distinct rare group of congenital heart diseases. Survival of unoperated ccTGA in the presence of large ventricular septal defect (VSD) is exceptional. Furthermore, late presentation of such patients in the absence of severe pulmonary hypertension or severe systemic right ventricle dysfunction is unusual. CASE REPORT We report a rare late presentation of ccTGA associated with large VSD in the absence of severe pulmonary hypertension or systemic ventricle dysfunction. An associated severe pulmonary valve stenosis maintained a balanced and stable condition up to the fourth decade of life. The patient has also dextrocardia, which is an unusual association. The diagnosis was reached using multimodality imaging including transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), transesophageal echography (TEE), cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR), and cardiac computed tomography (cardiac CT). CONCLUSIONS The presence of pulmonary stenosis can provide a physiological protection that avoids unnecessary surgical correction of large VSD in ccTGA patients. However, such a decision should be made on an individual basis and following a careful anatomical and functional evaluation.  
Frequency and Significance of Coronary Artery Disease and Myocardial Bridging in Patients With Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy.  ;"The etiology of chest pain in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HC) is diverse and includes coronary artery disease (CAD) as well as HC-specific causes. Myocardial bridging (MB) has been associated with HC, chest pain, and accelerated atherosclerosis. We compared HC patients with age-, gender- and CAD pre-test probability-matched outpatients presenting with chest pain to investigate differences in the presence of MB and CAD using coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA). We studied 84 HC patients who underwent CCTA and compared these with 168 matched controls (age 54 ± 11 years, 70% men, pre-test probability 12% [5% to 32%]). MB, calcium score, plaque morphology and presence and extent of CAD were assessed for each patient. Linear mixed models were used to assess differences between cases and controls. MB was more often seen in HC patients (50% vs 25%, p <0.001). Calcium score and the presence of obstructive CAD were similar in both groups (9 [0 to 225] vs 4 [0 to 82] and 18% vs 19%; p = 0.22 and p = 0.82). In the HC group, MB was associated with pathogenic DNA variants (p = 0.04), but not with the presence of chest pain (74% vs 76%, p = 0.8), nor with worse outcome (log-rank p = 0.30). In conclusion, the prevalence and extent of CAD was equal among patients with and without HC, demonstrating that pre-test risk prediction using the CAD Consortium clinical risk score performs well in HC patients. MB was twice as prevalent in the HC group compared with matched controls, but was not associated with chest pain or decreased event-free survival in these patients.  "
Transcatheter aortic valve replacement in patients with bicuspid aortic valve stenosis: national trends and in-hospital outcomes.  ;"BACKGROUND: Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) disease is considered the most common congenital heart disease and the main etiology of aortic valve stenosis (AS) in young adults. Although transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is routinely used in high- and intermediate-risk patients with AS, BAV patients with AS were excluded from all pivotal trials that led to TAVR approval. We sought, therefore, to examine in-hospital outcomes of patients with BAV who underwent TAVR in comparison with surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). METHODS: Using the National Inpatient Sample from 2011 to 2014, we identified patients with BAV with International Classification of Diseases-Ninth Revision-CM code 746.4. Patients who underwent TAVR were identified using ICD-9 codes 35.05 and 35.06 and those who underwent SAVR were identified using codes 35.21 and 35.22 during the same period. RESULTS: A total of 37,052 patients were found to have BAV stenosis. Among them, 36,629 patients (98.8%) underwent SAVR, whereas 423 patients (1.14%) underwent TAVR. One-third of enrolled patients were female, and the majority of the patients were White with a mean age of 65.9 ± 15.1 years. TAVR use for BAV stenosis significantly increased from 0.39% in 2011 to 4.16% in 2014 (P < 0.001), which represents a 3.77% overall growth in procedure rate. The median length of stay decreased significantly throughout the study period (mean 12.2 ± 8.2 days to 7.1 ± 5.9 days, P < 0.001). There was no statistically significant difference between SAVR and TAVR groups in the in-hospital mortality (0% vs. 5.9%; adjusted P = 0.119). CONCLUSION: There is a steady increase in TAVR use for BAV stenosis patients along with a significant decrease in length of stay.  "

David's procedure for pulmonary artery aneurysm.  ;Pulmonary artery aneurysm (PAA) is a rare entity with fatal complications. Its silent course contributes to large aneurysms with compression symptoms. We present a 39-year-old female idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension patient with a giant PAA causing severe pulmonary regurgitation (PR) and symptomatic left main coronary artery compression (LMCA). Since she had a failed LMCA stenting attempt, she underwent surgery. A valve-sparing David-like pulmonary trunk reconstruction and coronary artery bypass were performed. This case illustrates that David-like reconstruction procedure can be applied to the PAA with severe PR.  
Traumatic tricuspid valve regurgitation: A challenging case report.  ;Traumatic tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is a rare cause of acute right ventricular dysfunction. The surgical technique could be complex and the reparative gesture has a lower success rate when compared with functional TR. We present the case of a 26-year-old male patient with traumatic TR who underwent tricuspid valve repair, with an initial satisfactory result. Later, the onset of acute severe residual TR was observed and the valve needed to be replaced. Surgery is the mainstay of treatment for traumatic TR, either in the form of repair or replacement. It requires an early diagnosis and concomitant treatment of injuries.  
Adverse events and survival with postpericardiotomy syndrome after surgical aortic valve replacement.  ;"OBJECTIVES: Postpericardiotomy syndrome (PPS) is a relatively common complication after cardiac surgery. However, long-term follow-up data on the adverse events and mortality of PPS patients requiring invasive interventions are scarce. METHODS: We sought to assess the occurrence of mortality, new-onset atrial fibrillation (AF), cerebrovascular events, and major bleeds in PPS patients requiring medical attention in a combination database of 671 patients who underwent isolated surgical aortic valve replacement with a bioprosthesis (n = 361) or mechanical prosthesis (n = 310) between 2002 and 2014 (Cardiovascular Research Consortium-A Prospective Project to Identify Biomarkers of Morbidity and Mortality in Cardiovascular Interventional Patients [CAREBANK] 2016-2018). PPS was defined as moderate if it resulted in delayed hospital discharge, readmission, or medical therapy because of the symptoms; and severe if it required interventions for the evacuation of pleural or pericardial effusion. RESULTS: The overall incidence of PPS was 11.2%. Median time to diagnosis was 16 (interquartile range, 11-36) days. Severe PPS was diagnosed in 3.6% of patients. Severe PPS seemed to be associated with higher mortality (hazard ratio, 2.01; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-3.91; P = .040). Moderate or severe PPS increased the risk of new-onset AF during the early postoperative period (hazard ratio, 1.72; 95% confidence interval, 1.12-2.63; P = .012). No significant associations were found between PPS and cerebrovascular events or major bleeds during the follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with PPS requiring invasive interventions are at increased risk for mortality unlike those with mild to moderate forms of the disease. PPS requiring medical attention is associated with a higher AF rate during the early postoperative period but has no significant effect on the occurrence of major stroke, stroke or transient ischemic attack, or major bleeds during long-term follow-up.

Timing and Outcomes of Percutaneous Coronary Intervention in Patients Who Underwent Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.  ;"Limited data exist regarding the timing of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients with coronary artery disease who underwent transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). We aimed to investigate clinical outcomes of patients who underwent TAVI and planned PCI according to the timing of PCI in relation to the TAVI. Consecutive patients with severe aortic stenosis who underwent TAVI with planned PCI between January 2013 and November 2017 were included. Patients were divided according to the timing of PCI. The primary end point was major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events, defined as a composite of all-cause death, myocardial infarction, unplanned revascularization, and stroke. Among 1,756 patients who underwent TAVI, 258 patients underwent planned PCI either before TAVI (n = 143, 55.4%), concomitantly with TAVI (n = 77, 29.8%), or after TAVI (n = 38, 14.7%). All patients in the post-TAVI PCI group were treated using balloon-expandable valves, and neither hemodynamic instability during TAVI nor PCI-related complications were observed. In a multivariable analysis, the timing of PCI was not associated with 2-year major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events rate (concomitant vs pre-TAVI, hazard ratio [HR]: 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.52 to 1.66; p = 0.79; post- vs pre-TAVI, HR: 0.45; 95% CI: 0.18 to 1.16; p = 0.10). In conclusion, there were no significant differences in terms of mid-term outcomes among pre-TAVI, concomitant, and post-TAVI PCI groups when the timing of PCI was carefully selected by heart team.

Mixed Valvular Disease Following Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: Quantification and Systematic Differentiation Using Clinical Measurements and Image-Based Patient-Specific In Silico Modeling.  ;"Background Mixed valvular disease (MVD), mitral regurgitation (MR) from pre-existing disease in conjunction with paravalvular leak (PVL) following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), is one of the most important stimuli for left ventricle (LV) dysfunction, associated with cardiac mortality. Despite the prevalence of MVD, the quantitative understanding of the interplay between pre-existing MVD, PVL, LV, and post-TAVR recovery is meager. Methods and Results We quantified the effects of MVD on valvular-ventricular hemodynamics using an image-based patient-specific computational framework in 72 MVD patients. Doppler pressure was reduced by TAVR (mean, 77%; N=72; P<0.05), but it was not always accompanied by improvements in LV workload. TAVR had no effect on LV workload in 22 patients, and LV workload post-TAVR significantly rose in 32 other patients. TAVR reduced LV workload in only 18 patients (25%). PVL significantly alters LV flow and increases shear stress on transcatheter aortic valve leaflets. It interacts with mitral inflow and elevates shear stresses on mitral valve and is one of the main contributors in worsening of MR post-TAVR. MR worsened in 32 patients post-TAVR and did not improve in 18 other patients. Conclusions PVL limits the benefit of TAVR by increasing LV load and worsening of MR and heart failure. Post-TAVR, most MVD patients (75% of N=72; P<0.05) showed no improvements or even worsening of LV workload, whereas the majority of patients with PVL, but without that pre-existing MR condition (60% of N=48; P<0.05), showed improvements in LV workload. MR and its exacerbation by PVL may hinder the success of TAVR.  "
Long-term follow-up with a smartphone application improves exercise capacity post cardiac rehabilitation: A randomized controlled trial.  ;BACKGROUND: Mobile health interventions, especially smartphone applications (apps), have been proposed as promising interventions for supporting adherence to healthy behaviour in patients post cardiac rehabilitation (CR). The overall aim of the study was to examine the effect of individualized follow-up with an app for one year on peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak) in patients completing CR. DESIGN: The study was designed as a single-blinded multicentre randomized controlled trial. METHODS: The intervention group (IG) received individualized follow-up enabled with an app for one year, while the control group (CG) received usual care. The primary outcome was difference in VO2peak. Secondary outcomes included exercise performance (time to exhaustion, peak incline (%) and peak velocity (km/h)), bodyweight, resting blood pressure, lipid profile, triglycerides, exercise habits, health-related quality of life, health status and self-perceived goal achievement. RESULTS: In total, 113 patients completing CR (73.4% with coronary artery disease, 16.8% after valve surgery and 9.8% with other heart diseases) were randomly allocated to the IG or CG. Intention to treat analyses showed a statistically significant difference in VO2peak between the groups at follow-up of 2.2 ml/kg/min, 95% confidence interval 0.9-3.5 (p < 0.001). Statistically significant differences were also observed in exercise performance, exercise habits and in self-perceived goal achievement. CONCLUSIONS: Individualized follow-up for one year with an app significantly improved VO2peak, exercise performance and exercise habits, as well as self-perceived goal achievement, compared with a CG in patients post-CR. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups at follow-up in the other outcome measures evaluated.

Insights into the molecular pathogenesis of cardiospondylocarpofacial syndrome: MAP3K7 c.737-7A > G variant alters the TGFβ-mediated α-SMA cytoskeleton assembly and autophagy.  ;Transforming growth factor beta-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) is a highly conserved kinase protein encoded by MAP3K7, and activated by multiple extracellular stimuli, growth factors and cytokines. Heterozygous variants in MAP3K7 cause the cardiospondylocarpofacial syndrome (CSCFS) which is characterized by short stature, dysmorphic facial features, cardiac septal defects with valve dysplasia, and skeletal anomalies. CSCFS has been described in seven patients to date and its molecular pathogenesis is only partially understood. Here, the functional effects of the MAP3K7 c.737-7A > G variant, previously identified in a girl with CSCFS and additional soft connective tissue features, were explored. This splice variant generates an in-frame insertion of 2 amino acid residues in the kinase domain of TAK1. Computational analysis revealed that this in-frame insertion alters protein dynamics in the kinase activation loop responsible for TAK1 autophosphorylation after binding with its interactor TAB1. Co-immunoprecipitation studies demonstrate that the ectopic expression of TAK1-mutated protein impairs its ability to physically bind TAB1. In patient's fibroblasts, MAP3K7 c.737-7A > G variant results in reduced TAK1 autophosphorylation and dysregulation of the downstream TAK1-dependent signaling pathway. TAK1 loss-of-function is associated with an impaired TGFβ-mediated α-SMA cytoskeleton assembly and cell migration, and defective autophagy process. These findings contribute to our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of CSCFS and might offer the rationale for the design of novel therapeutic targets.

Platelet Membrane-Coated Nanoparticles Target Sclerotic Aortic Valves in ApoE(-/-) Mice by Multiple Binding Mechanisms Under Pathological Shear Stress.  ;BACKGROUND: Aortic valve disease is the most common valvular heart disease leading to valve replacement. The efficacy of pharmacological therapy for aortic valve disease is limited by the high mechanical stress at the aortic valves impairing the binding rate. We aimed to identify nanoparticle coating with entire platelet membranes to fully mimic their inherent multiple adhesive mechanisms and target the sclerotic aortic valve of apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE-/-) mice based on their multiple sites binding capacity under high shear stress. METHODS: Considering the potent interaction of platelet membrane glycoproteins with components present in sclerotic aortic valves, platelet membrane-coated nanoparticles (PNPs) were synthetized and the binding capacity under high shear stress was evaluated in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: PNPs demonstrated effectively adhering to von Willebrand factor, collagen and fibrin under shear stresses in vitro. In an aortic valve disease model established in ApoE-/- mice, PNPs exhibited good targeting to sclerotic aortic valves by mimicking platelet multiple adhesive mechanisms. CONCLUSION: PNPs could provide a promising platform for the molecular diagnosis and targeting treatment of aortic valve disease.

Cardiac rehabilitation of elderly patients in eight rehabilitation units in western Europe: Outcome data from the EU-CaRE multi-centre observational study.  ;AIMS: The European Cardiac Rehabilitation in the Elderly (EU-CaRE) HORIZON 2020 project compares the sustainable effects of cardiac rehabilitation (CR) in elderly patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 1633 patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) or heart valve replacement (HVR), with or without revascularization, aged 65 or above, who participated in CR were included. Peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak), smoking, body mass index, diet, physical activity, serum lipids, psychological distress and medication were assessed before and after CR (T0 and T1) and after 12 months (T2). Patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery or surgical HVR had lower VO2peak at T0 and a greater increase to T1 and T2 (2.8 and 4.4 ml/kg/min, respectively) than CAD patients undergoing percutaneous or no revascularization (1.6 and 1.4 ml/kg/min, respectively). After multivariable adjustment, earlier CR uptake was associated with greater improvements in VO2peak. The proportion of CAD patients with three or more uncontrolled risk factors declined from 58.4% at T0 to 40.1% at T2 (p < 0.0001). Psychological distress scores all improved and adherence to medication was overall good at all sites. There were significant differences in risk factor burden across sites, but no CR program was superior to others. CONCLUSIONS: The outcomes of VO2peak in CR programs across Europe seemed mainly determined by timing of uptake and were maintained or even further improved at 1-year follow-up. Despite significant improvements, 40.1% of CAD patients still had three or more risk factors not at target after 1 year. Differences across sites could not be ascribed to characteristics of the CR programs offered.  
Aortic Valve Calcium Associates with All-Cause Mortality Independent of Coronary Artery Calcium and Inflammation in Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease.  ;"BACKGROUND: Aortic valve calcium (AVC) and coronary artery calcium (CAC) are common complications in end-stage renal disease (ESRD). We investigated the prognostic significance of overlapping presence of AVC and CAC, and whether AVC was associated with all-cause mortality independent of the presence of CAC in ESRD. METHODS: 259 ESRD patients (median age 55 years, 67% males) undergoing cardiac computed tomography were included. Framingham risk score (FRS), presence of cardiovascular disease (CVD), statin use, nutritional status and other relevant laboratory data were determined at baseline. During follow-up for median 36 months, 44 patients died, and 68 patients underwent renal transplantation. RESULTS: The baseline overlap presence of AVC and CAC was 37%. Multivariate regression analysis showed that FRS (odds ratio (OR) 2.25; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.43-3.55) and CAC score (OR (95% CI), 2.18 (1.34-3.59)) were independent determinants of AVC. In competing-risk regression models adjusted for presence of CAC, inflammation, nutritional status, CVD, FRS and statin use, AVC remained independently associated with all-cause mortality (sub-hazard ratio (95% CI), 2.57 (1.20-5.51)). CONCLUSIONS: The overlap of AVC and CAC was 37% in this ESRD cohort. AVC was associated with increased all-cause mortality independent of presence of CAC, traditional risk factors and inflammation.

[Efficacy of transcatheter pulmonary valve perforation by micro-guidewire and balloon dilation in neonates with pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum].  ;Objective: To investigate the safety and efficacy of transcatheter perforation of pulmonary valve by micro-guidewire and balloon dilation in the treatment of neonatal pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum (PA-IVS). Methods: The retrospective study included 21 neonates (14 males and 7 females) with PA-IVS who underwent transcatheter micro-guidewire pulmonary valve perforation and balloon dilation in Xinhua Hospital from January 2012 to December 2018. All patients underwent the pulmonary valve perforation by micro-guidewire through the Simmons catheter. During the follow-up period at 1, 3, 6, 12 months postoperatively and annually thereafter, the operative efficacy and the development of the right ventricle (RV) were evaluated by echocardiography. Statistical analyses were performed using t test. Results: A total of 21 neonates with PA-IVS were enrolled, and 13 cases were diagnosed prenatally. The median age of surgery was 6 days, the weight was (3.2±0.5) kg. The balloon/valve ratio was 1.19±0.12, and the RV pressure measured by catheter was (121±33) mmHg (1 mmHg=0.133 kPa) . The immediate postoperative RV pressure was (47±13) mmHg. The median follow-up time was 30 months. All the cases enrolled achieved biventricular circulation without death and serious complications. According to the last follow-up data including 16 cases who were followed up for 1 year or longer, the pulmonary artery transvalvular pressure was (29±15) mmHg. The postoperation ratio of right to left ventricular transverse diameter was significantly higher than that before operation (0.86+0.10 vs. 0.73+0.13, t=-2.96, P=0.006). Compared with preoperative data, the postoperation pulmonary valvular diameter Z-score was significantly higher (-1.41±0.89 vs. -2.83±1.06, t=-3.65, P=0.001) and the tricuspid valvular diameter Z-score was significantly higher (-0.52±0.29 vs. -1.34±0.81, t=-3.55, P=0.001). Conclusion: Transcatheter perforation of pulmonary valve by micro-guidewire and balloon dilation is a safe and effective initial therapy for neonatal PA-IVS.

Recent advances in devices for minimally invasive aortic valve replacement.  ;Introduction: Aortic valve disease is the most common valvular heart disease. Aortic valve replacement (AVR) is the treatment of choice for aortic valve stenosis (AS). Multiple options have been developed to treat AS, corresponding to the steadily growing AVR case volume. The increased adoption of minimally invasive aortic valve replacement (mini-AVR) techniques, despite being technically challenging, is reflected in its advantageous outcomes. Continuous device development can add a critical value to the technical expertise and advance the proficiency of mini-AVR.Areas covered: The literature related to Mini-AVR is reviewed for the current state-of-the-art approach to treating valvular diseases. The latest technologies to treat AS were reviewed and compared with outcomes. A brief expert review of the current state of structural heart and valvular surgery programs is discussed to address collaboration and future challenges.Expert commentary: The treatment of aortic valve disease has evolved in a manner which cardiac surgeons and cardiologists would have never imagined. Advances in surgical techniques and increased training courses have improved adoption of minimally invasive aortic valve procedures. In addition, the recent development of facilitating devices has significantly improved the exposure necessary to perform an expeditious and safe operation.

In vivo tissue engineering of a trilayered leaflet-shaped tissue construct.  ;Aim: We aimed to develop a leaflet-shaped trilayered tissue construct mimicking the morphology of native heart valve leaflets. Materials & methods: Electrospinning and in vivo tissue engineering methods were employed. Results: We developed leaflet-shaped microfibrous scaffolds, each with circumferentially, randomly and radially oriented three layers mimicking the trilayered, oriented structure of native leaflets. After 3 months in vivo tissue engineering with the scaffolds, the generated leaflet-shaped tissue constructs had a trilayered structure mimicking the orientations of native heart valve leaflets. Presence of collagen, glycosaminoglycans and elastin seen in native leaflets was observed in the engineered tissue constructs. Conclusion: Trilayered, oriented fibrous scaffolds brought the orientations of the infiltrated cells and their produced extracellular matrix proteins into the constructs.  
Staphylococcus saprophyticus native valve endocarditis possibly originating from the lower gastrointestinal tract.  ;"Staphylococcus saprophyticus is a common pathogen associated with uncomplicated urinary tract infection in young women and commonly colonizes in the lower gastrointestinal tract as commensal bacterium. Bacteremia or infective endocarditis caused by S. saprophyticus has rarely been reported, and in almost all cases reported of bacteremia, it originated from the urinary tract or intravascular catheter-related infections. Herein, we report the case of a 77-year-old woman diagnosed with S. saprophyticus native bivalve endocarditis. Interestingly, blood and resected valve tissue cultures revealed positive results, whereas urine culture revealed negative results. There was no evidence of any portal of entry, including the urinary tract or vascular catheter; the lower gastrointestinal tract was strongly suspected as the portal of entry, considering that her symptoms developed suddenly after undergoing a polypectomy procedure. After admission, she underwent valve replacement surgery followed by 6 weeks of antimicrobial therapy and recovered completely. This case demonstrates that the lower gastrointestinal tract can be the source of S. saprophyticus bacteremia.  "
Impact of Predilatation Prior to Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation With the Self-Expanding Acurate neo Device (from the Multicenter NEOPRO Registry).  ;"Safety and feasibility of transfemoral Acurate neo implantation without systematic predilatation are not fully investigated. Our aim was to evaluate the use and impact of pre-implantation balloon aortic valvuloplasty (pre-BAV) before transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) with Acurate neo. The NEOPRO Registry retrospectively included 1,263 patients who underwent transfemoral TAVI with Acurate neo at 18 centers between January 2012 and March 2018. Information on pre-BAV was available for 1,262 patients (99.9%). Primary end points were pre-discharge moderate-to-severe paravalvular aortic regurgitation (PAR II+), 30-day new permanent pacemaker implantation, and 30-day all-cause mortality or stroke. A total of 1,262 patients who underwent TAVI with (n = 1,051) or without predilatation (n = 211) were included. A reduction in the pre-BAV rate was observed during the study period (from 95.7% in the first date quintile to 78.4% in the last date quintile). Patients who underwent pre-BAV had higher degrees of aortic valve (AV) and left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) calcification. Primary endpoints were similar between pre-BAV and no pre-BAV groups (PAR II+ 5.5% vs 3.4%, p = 0.214; 30-day permanent pacemaker implantation 9.0% vs 8.0%, p = 0.660; 30-day death or stroke 4.9% vs 4.4%, p = 0.743). The need for postdilatation and other procedural outcomes were comparable between groups. Predilatation did not have a significant impact on primary endpoints across AV and LVOT calcification subgroups (subgroup analyses) and was not independently associated with primary endpoints (multivariate analyses). In conclusion, transfemoral Acurate neo implantation without predilatation appears to be feasible and safe, especially in patients with milder degrees of AV and LVOT calcification.  "
Outcomes of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in Patients With Bicuspid Aortic Valve Disease: A Report From the Society of Thoracic Surgeons/American College of Cardiology Transcatheter Valve Therapy Registry.  ;"BACKGROUND: Patients with bicuspid aortic valve (AV) stenosis were excluded from the pivotal evaluations of transcatheter AV replacement (TAVR) devices. We sought to evaluate the outcomes of TAVR in patients with bicuspid AV stenosis in comparison with those with tricuspid AV stenosis. METHODS: We used data from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons/American College of Cardiology Transcatheter Valve Therapy Registry (November 2011 through November 2018) to determine device success, procedural outcomes, post-TAVR valve performance, and in-hospital clinical outcomes (mortality, stroke, and major bleeding) according to valve morphology (bicuspid versus tricuspid). Results were stratified by older and current (Sapien 3 and Evolut R) generation valve prostheses. Medicare administrative claims were used to evaluate mortality and stroke to 1 year among eligible individuals (≥65 years). RESULTS: After exclusions, there were 170 959 eligible procedures at 593 sites during the specified interval. Of these, 5412 TAVR procedures (3.2%) were performed in patients with bicuspid AV, including 3705 with current-generation devices. In comparison with patients with tricuspid valves, patients with bicuspid AV were younger and had a lower Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk of Operative Mortality score. When current-generation devices were used to treat patients with bicuspid AV, device success increased (93.5 versus 96.3; P=0.001) and the incidence of 2+ aortic insufficiency declined (14.0% versus 2.7%; P<0.001) in comparison with older-generation devices. With current-generation devices, device success was slightly lower in the bicuspid (versus tricuspid) AV group (96.3% in bicuspid versus 97.4% in tricuspid, P=0.07), with a slightly higher incidence of residual moderate or severe aortic insufficiency among patients with bicuspid AV (2.7% versus 2.1%; P<0.001). A lower 1-year adjusted risk of mortality (hazard ratio, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.78-0.99]) was observed for patients with bicuspid AV versus patients with tricuspid AV in the Medicare-linked cohort, whereas no difference was observed in the 1-year adjusted risk of stroke (hazard ratio, 1.14 [95% CI, 0.94-1.39]). CONCLUSIONS: Using current-generation devices, procedural, postprocedural, and 1-year outcomes were comparable following TAVR for bicuspid AV versus tricuspid AV disease. With newer-generation devices, TAVR is a viable treatment option for patients with bicuspid AV disease.  "
Early clinical experience with the straight design of Venus P-valve™ in dysfunctional right ventricular outflow tracts.  ;OBJECTIVES: To assess the initial procedural and short to medium-term experience with the straight design of the Venus P-valve™ (Venus MedTech, Hangzhou, China) in dysfunctional right ventricular outflow tracts (RVOT). BACKGROUND: The Melody™ valve (Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minnesota) has been the only percutaneous valve option for smaller RVOT conduits. The straight Venus P-valve™ may provide an alternative to the Melody™ valve. METHODS: Retrospective data collection of patient characteristics, procedural data, clinical and imaging follow-up of the straight Venus P-valve™. RESULTS: Nine patients (four female) with a mean age of 23.1 ± 7.5 years and a mean weight of 72.7 ± 29.4 kg underwent straight Venus P-valve™ implantation between 03/2014 and 06/2016. All patients had right ventricle-to-pulmonary artery conduits which were pre-stented before the valve implantation. All valves were deployed successfully without any significant procedural complications. During the mean follow-up of 24 ± 9.1 months, there were no valve related re-interventions or deterioration in valve performance. There was one case of insignificant, single wire frame fracture and no cases of endocarditis. The cohort demonstrated a reduction in pulmonary regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation, which was sustained throughout the follow-up. Similarly the gradient across the RVOT tract did not significantly increase. CONCLUSIONS: Implantation of the straight Venus P-valve™ has provided satisfactory short to mid-term results with high success rates and no complications and may be considered as an alternative option in patients with RVOT dysfunction.  
Non-coronary atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia.  ;"Objective: Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is a common autosomal dominant inherited disease, affecting 1 in 200-500 individuals worldwide. FH is characterized by elevated circulating low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentrations. Its association with increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) (>10-fold, compared with patients without FH) is well documented. However, the association between FH and non-CHD atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk has been poorly documented.Methods: PubMed was searched for English language publications regarding the association between FH and carotid artery stenosis, stroke, peripheral artery disease (PAD; lower limbs and other arterial beds), aortic valve calcification (AoVC), aortic and renal artery disease, chronic kidney disease, atrial fibrillation and heart failure, from conception until 22 December 2019.Results: Despite the small number of available studies, as well as their characteristics (sample size, diagnostic criteria used, retrospective or cross-sectional design), there is evidence for a positive association between FH and stroke, PAD or AoVC. More data are needed for definitive conclusions regarding aortic and renal artery disease, chronic kidney disease, atrial fibrillation and heart failure. There is paucity of data with respect to homozygous FH. Increased lipoprotein (a) concentrations, often seen in FH patients, may also contribute to this non-CHD atherosclerotic process. A key question is whether statins or other LDL-C-lowering therapies, provide an additional reduction in the risk of these less-recognized vascular and non-vascular complications in FH patients.Conclusions: Heterozygous FH is associated with increased risk for stroke, PAD and AoVC. Clinicians should take these non-CHD ASCVD aspects into consideration for optimal management of FH patients.  "
Numerical evaluation of transcatheter aortic valve performance during heart beating and its post-deployment fluid-structure interaction analysis.  ;Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a minimally invasive procedure that provides an effective alternative to open-heart surgical valve replacement for treating advanced calcific aortic valve disease patients. However, complications, such as valve durability, device migration, paravalvular leakage (PVL), and thrombogenicity may lead to increased overall post-TAVR morbidity and mortality. A series of numerical studies involving a self-expandable TAVR valve were performed to evaluate these complications. Structural studies were performed with finite element (FE) analysis, followed by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, and fluid-structure interaction (FSI) analysis. The FE analysis was utilized to study the effect of TAVR valve implantation depth on valve anchorage in the Living Heart Human Model, which is capable of simulating beating heart during repeated cardiac cycles. The TAVR deployment cases where no valve migration was observed were then used to calculate the post-deployment thrombogenic potential via CFD simulations. FSI analysis followed to further assess the post-deployment TAVR hemodynamic performance for different implantation depths. The deployed valves PVL, geometric and effective orifice areas, and the leaflets structural and flow stress magnitudes were compared to determine the device optimal landing zone. The combined structural and hemodynamic analysis indicated that with the TAVR valve deployed at an aft ventricle position an optimal performance was achieved in the specific anatomy studied. Given the TAVR's rapid expansion to younger lower-risk patients, the comprehensive numerical methodology proposed here can potentially be used as a predictive tool for both procedural planning and valve design optimization to minimize the reported complications.  
Magnetic Resonance Imaging Risk Factors for Ventricular Arrhythmias in Tetralogy of Fallot.  ;Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is the most common cause of late mortality in tetralogy of Fallot (TOF). Pulmonary regurgitation (PR) was previously found to be the most common hemodynamic abnormality associated with ventricular arrhythmias (VA), but cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR)-based studies did not show this association. The aim of this study is to investigate the risk factors for VA in TOF using CMR. Electronic records of TOF patients and their CMR studies between July 2006 and October 2018 in one center were retrospectively reviewed. Demographic, clinical and CMR data of patients were collected. Outcome was defined as sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT), aborted SCD and SCD. From a total of 434 TOF patients with complete CMR studies, 19 (4.4%) patients developed a positive outcome (12 sustained VT, 4 aborted SCD, 3 SCD) at a median age of 24 years. The number of surgical interventions was significantly greater in patients who developed VA. Right ventricular volumes were significantly larger in patients who suffered a positive outcome. Odds ratio for developing VA was 6.905 for RVEDVI ≥ 160 ml/m2 and 6.141 for RVESVI ≥ 80 ml/m2 (P = 0.0014 and 0.0012, respectively). Event-free survival was longer in patients with smaller right ventricular volumes. In conclusion, right ventricular dimensions are the most significant factors associated with the development of VA in TOF. The number of surgical interventions is also related to an increased risk.  
Incidence of Atrioventricular Block After Valve Replacement in Carcinoid Heart Disease.  ;BACKGROUND: Carcinoid heart disease (CaHD) is a rare condition that has a high impact on the morbidity and mortality of its patients. Once heart failure symptoms develop in the patient with CaHD, cardiac valve surgery is often the only effective treatment. Although atrioventricular block (AVB) is a known postoperative complication of the valve surgery, the incidence of AVB in this population has not been well described. METHODS: Comprehensive records were collected retrospectively on consecutive patients with CaHD who underwent a valve surgery at a tertiary medical center from January 2001 to December 2015. We excluded patients with pre-existing permanent pacemaker (PPM). RESULTS: Nineteen consecutive patients were included in this study and 18 of them underwent at least dual valve (tricuspid and pulmonary valve) replacement surgery. Our 30-day post-surgical mortality was 0%. During the 6-month observation period following the surgery, 31.5% (n = 6) required PPM implantation due to complete AVB. There was no statistical difference in baseline characteristics and electrocardiographic and echocardiographic parameters between the patients who did or did not require PPM placement. CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed that almost one-third of CaHD patients who underwent a valve replacement surgery developed AVB requiring PPM implantation. Due to high incidence of PPM requirement, we believe that prophylactic placement of an epicardial lead during the valve surgery can be helpful in these patients to reduce serious complication from placement of pacemaker lead on a later date through a prosthetic valve.  
Novel Anatomic Predictors of New Persistent Left Bundle Branch Block After Evolut Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.  ;New persistent left bundle branch block (NP-LBBB) has been associated with adverse outcomes after TAVI but few predictors thus far reported. We sought to identify predictors of NP-LBBB after TAVI with EvolutR/PRO (ER/EP). From 1/2016 to 4/2019, 544 patients from 2 centers underwent TAVI with Evolut (54% ER, 46% EP) for severe native aortic stenosis. Patients with previous LBBB and pacemaker were excluded. Aortic root analysis was performed using 3Mensio Valves Software and membranous septal length (MSL) was determined using the standard coronal view. Clinical, anatomic and procedural characteristics of 396 Evolut were analyzed and predictors of NP-LBBB were identified. Valve Academic Research Consortium-2 outcomes were reported. At discharge, NP-LBBB was seen in 76(19.2%) patients. NP-LBBB in Evolut was associated with implant depth at left coronary cusp (p = 0.004) and 34 mm ER (p = 0.026). Independent predictors of NP-LBBB in Evolut were shorter MSL (odds ratio [OR] = 0.82 per mm septum, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.68 to 0.98,p = 0.030), left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) eccentricity (OR = 1.04 per %, 95% CI = 1.01 to 1.06,p = 0.002), implant depth at noncoronary cusp (NCC) (OR = 1.28 per mm ventricular, 95% CI = 1.11 to 1.48,p = 0.001) and annular perimeter oversizing ≥20% (OR = 2.38, 95% CI = 1.20 to 4.72, p = 0.013). On ROC curve analysis, MSL ≤6.5 mm, NCC depth ≥3 mm and LVOT eccentricity ≥35% were optimal threshold values to predict NP-LBBB. In Conclusion, shorter MSL, LVOT eccentricity, annular oversizing and deeper implant depth are novel predictors of NP-LBBB in Evolut TAVI. Preprocedural CT assessment of aortic root anatomy may help identify patients at risk for NP-LBBB. In such patients, modifying procedural factors such as higher implant and less annular oversizing may reduce the risk of NP-LBBB. Further evaluation of our hypothesis is warranted.  
Surgical mitral valve replacement using direct implantation of Sapien 3 valve in a patients with severe mitral annular calcification without adjunctive techniques, a case report.  ;BACKGROUND: Mitral annular calcification (MAC) occurs represents a challenge to surgeons during mitral valve (MV) surgery with increased perioperative risk. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe a challenging case of an elderly female patient with multiple comorbidities who presented with symptoms and signs of heart failure with a previous history of mechanical aortic valve replacement 15 years prior to presentation. Echocardiogram showed severe mitral stenosis and regurgitation with severe calcification of the mitral annulus. Given her high-risk profile and unavailability of suitable percutaneous therapeutic options we decided to replace her mitral valve with Sapien 3 valve under direct exposure. The case describes the technical details for the valve implantation and demonstrates the viability of this option in high risk surgical patients without the need for adjunct techniques like predilatation, additional supporting sutures or patches with a review of the literature on open surgical implantation of Sapien 3 valve. CONCLUSION: Direct open surgical implantation of Sapien 3 valve can be implanted safely in patients with severe MAC, without predilatation and without the use of other adjunctive techniques like fixation sutures or patches.  
Pulmonary Valve Endocarditis: The Potential Utility of Multimodal Imaging Prior to Surgery.  ;BACKGROUND: The presence of echocardiographic (echo) evidence is a major criterion for the diagnosis of infective endocarditis (IE) by modified Duke criteria. Pulmonary valve (PV) IE, however, can be challenging to identify by echo. We sought to evaluate the added utility of multimodal imaging in PV IE. METHODS: This is a single-center case series. We retrospectively analyzed demographic, laboratory, imaging, clinical, and surgical data from patients diagnosed with PV IE from 2008 to 2018. RESULTS: A total of 23 patients were identified with definite PV IE by Duke criteria (83% male and ages 2 months to 70 years). Twenty-two patients had congenital heart disease, with 21 involving the right ventricular outflow tract (including three with transcatheter PV implant). Overall, 20 (87%) of 23 had positive blood cultures. A total of 17 (74%) of 23 patients demonstrated echo evidence of PV IE. In three cases, echo was negative (did not show vegetations) but showed new PV obstruction. In four cases with negative transthoracic echocardiogram and transesophageal echocardiogram, evidence of PV IE was subsequently seen by positron emission tomography/computed tomography (n = 2) or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (n = 2). Pulmonary valve IE was confirmed at surgery by evaluation of pathologic samples in 20 cases. CONCLUSIONS: Multimodal imaging improves the ability to preoperatively identify endocardial involvement in PV IE in cases where echo is negative. Consideration should be given to revise Duke criteria to include new obstruction and endocardial involvement by multimodal imaging for PV IE.  
Surgical Management of Heterotaxy Syndrome: Current Challenges and Opportunities.  ;INTRODUCTION: Heterotaxy syndrome presents a unique challenge in surgical management, even in the current era. We hypothesized that certain anatomic subsets merit novel strategies. METHODS: We analyzed morphologic details, surgeries, comorbidities, subsequent admissions, and survival using Kaplan-Meier methods and multivariable risk models from a single-institution experience of 103 consecutive patients with heterotaxy who underwent cardiac surgery between January 1, 1990, and May 31, 2016. RESULTS: Of the 103 patients (50 males and 53 females), 31 had left atrial isomerism, 64 had right atrial isomerism (RAI), and 8 patients' isomerism was indeterminate (IND), with first cardiac operation at a mean 1.0 year (standard deviation ±3.0 years) of age. Kaplan-Meier overall survival estimate was 83.1% at six months, 77.8% at one year, 65.9% at five years, and 52.1% at ten years. Survival was particularly low among RAI following repair of total anomalous pulmonary venous connection (TAPVC) at first operation, with one- and five-year survival of 57% and 46%, respectively. By multivariable analysis, the only risk factor for death during the early phase (hazard model) was repair of TAPVC at the first cardiac operation (hazard ratio [HR]: 4.4, P = .01), and risk factors during the longer term constant phase were atrioventricular valve (AVV) regurgitation (HR: 4.2, P < .01), male gender (HR: 3.7, P < .01), and two-ventricle repair (HR: 3.0, P = .02). Patients with heterotaxy undergoing the Fontan procedure had excellent subsequent survival (85% at ten years). CONCLUSIONS: This analysis of over 100 patients with heterotaxy identified TAPVC requiring initial repair as the major risk factor for early death and important AVV regurgitation as the major risk factor in the longer term. Survival with RAI and early repair of TAPVC were poor, with one-year mortality exceeding 40%. Patients with single ventricle completing the Fontan operation enjoyed outstanding ten-year survival (85%). Initial management of RAI requiring early repair of TAPVC remains challenging. For this high-risk subset, alternative strategies such as early referral for cardiac transplantation evaluation warrant consideration.  
A multilayered valve leaflet promotes cell-laden collagen type I production and aortic valve hemodynamics.  ;Patients with aortic heart valve disease are limited to valve replacements that lack the ability to grow and remodel. This presents a major challenge for pediatric patients who require a valve capable of somatic growth and at a smaller size. A patient-specific heart valve capable of growth and remodeling while maintaining proper valve function would address this major issue. Here, we recreate the native valve leaflet structure composed of poly-ε-caprolactone (PCL) and cell-laden gelatin-methacrylate/poly (ethylene glycol) diacrylate (GelMA/PEGDA) hydrogels using 3D printing and molding, and then evaluate the ability of the multilayered scaffold to produce collagen matrix under physiological shear stress conditions. We also characterized the valve hemodynamics under aortic physiological flow conditions. The valve's fibrosa layer was replicated by 3D printing PCL in a circumferential direction similar to collagen alignment in the native leaflet, and GelMA/PEGDA sustained and promoted cell viability in the spongiosa/ventricularis layers. We found that collagen type I production can be increased in the multilayered scaffold when it is exposed to pulsatile shear stress conditions over static conditions. When the PCL component was mounted onto a valve ring and tested under physiological aortic valve conditions, the hemodynamics were comparable to commercially available valves. Our results demonstrate that a structurally representative valve leaflet can be generated using 3D printing and that the PCL layer of the leaflet can sustain proper valve function under physiological aortic valve conditions.  
Solo Smart stentless bioprosthesis for extensive aortic annular defects caused by infective endocarditis.  ;"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The optimal valve and prosthesis in patients with aortic valve infective endocarditis with annular abscess is controversial. If extensive annular defects occur after debridement, standard techniques are difficult; more complex aortic root replacement (ARR) or aortic valve translocation technique are inevitable. The Solo Smart stentless bioprosthesis is specially designed for supra-annular implantation without annular stitches. METHODS: Nineteen patients with active aortic valve infective endocarditis underwent aortic valve replacement in the past 3 years. Of these, we performed aortic valve replacement using the Solo Smart valve in four patients with extensive annular destruction and complex aortic root pathologies requiring reconstruction. RESULTS: Although more than two-thirds of the annular structure was missing after radical debridement of infected tissues, supra-annular aortic valve replacement with the Solo Smart valve could be performed successfully in all four patients. All patients are doing well without prosthetic valve dysfunction and/or recurrent infection. CONCLUSION: The supra-annular aortic valve replacement using the Solo Smart valve is considered to be a useful alternative to standard aortic valve replacement in patients complicated with extensive annular defect. It is a simple and technically less demanding alternative to ARR or aortic valve translocation technique.  "
Early restenosis of a direct flow transcatheter aortic valve prosthesis.  ;Due to limited case numbers, severe Direct flow™ transcatheter device restenosis is, until now, a rare event with unknown long-term incidence, but challenging several treatment strategies. This case report gives an overview of possible interventional treatment considerations in this context that might occur more often in the future due to expected valve deterioration processes in the next years.

Predictors and safety of next-day discharge in patients undergoing transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation.  ;"AIMS: The aim of this study was to evaluate predictors and safety of next-day discharge (NDD) after transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TF-TAVI) in unselected patients receiving either balloon-expandable or self-expanding devices. METHODS AND RESULTS: From June 2007 to August 2018, 1,232 consecutive patients undergoing TF-TAVI were discharged alive from our institution. They had a mean age of 80.9±5.4 years and an intermediate estimated surgical mortality risk; they received either balloon-expandable (26.1%) or self-expanding prostheses (73.9%). We compared patients discharged within 24 hours from the procedure (n=160, 13.0%) with those discharged later, and accounted for confounding variables through a propensity matching adjustment. After adjustment, no differences in all-cause mortality (1.2% vs 0.0%, for NDD and no-NDD matched groups, respectively, p=0.16) or permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI) after TAVI (0.6% vs 0.6%, respectively) were encountered at 30 days. At one year, no difference in the composite endpoint of all-cause death and heart failure (HF) rehospitalisation was encountered (Kaplan-Meier [KM] estimates 91.9% vs 90.6% for NDD and no-NDD matched groups, respectively, p=0.69). After excluding patients with post-procedural major complications from the unmatched population, prior PPI (OR 2.06, 95% CI: 1.21-3.51; p<0.01) and availability of preprocedural computed tomography angiography (CTA) (OR 1.71, 95% CI: 1.15-2.54; p<0.01) were found to be predictors of NDD after TAVI. CONCLUSIONS: NDD in unselected patients after TF-TAVI using either balloon-expandable or self-expanding devices was demonstrated to be a safe strategy up to one year in the absence of procedural complications. Patients with prior PPI and undergoing preprocedural CTA had a higher chance of NDD.  "

Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Feature Tracking in Aortic Stenosis: Exploration of Strain Parameters and Prognostic Value in Asymptomatic Patients with Preserved Ejection Fraction.  ;OBJECTIVE: To determine the most valuable cardiac magnetic resonance feature tracking (CMR-FT) parameters for evaluating aortic stenosis (AS) and determine whether they can predict the prognosis in asymptomatic AS patients with preserved ejection fraction (pEF). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective cohort of 123 moderate to severe AS patients (60 males, 68.6 ± 9.2 years) and 32 control subjects (14 males, 67.9 ± 4.4 years) underwent echocardiography and 3T CMR imaging from 2011-2015. CMR cine images were analyzed using CMR-FT to assess the left ventricular radial, circumferential, and longitudinal peak strain (PS) in 2- and 3-dimensions. The primary endpoints were clinical cardiac events (CCEs), including cardiac death, heart failure, and AS-associated symptom development. For statistical analysis, logistic regression and log-rank tests were used. RESULTS: Global PSs differed between AS patients and controls and between severe and moderate AS patients (p < 0.05). Two-dimensional (2D) global radial and longitudinal PSs changed gradually with the severity of AS groups (p < 0.001). Twenty-two of 67 asymptomatic AS patients with pEF experienced CCEs during the follow-up (median: 31.1 months). 2D global longitudinal PS (GLPS) was the single risk factor for CCE (p = 0.017). The relative risk for CCE was 3.9 (p = 0.016, 95% confidence interval: 1.2-11.9) based on 2D GLPS with a cutoff of -17.9% according to receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Survival analysis demonstrated that asymptomatic AS patients with pEF having impaired 2D GLPS experienced worse event-free survival than the others (p = 0.041). CONCLUSION: 2D global longitudinal and radial PSs may reflect cardiac dysfunction according to the degree of AS. 2D GLPS might be a prognostic predictor of CCEs in asymptomatic AS patients with pEF.  
Relationship between nocturnal blood pressure patterns and end organ damage and diastolic dysfunction in heart transplant recipients.  ;BACKGROUND: We assessed the relationship between circadian blood pressure (BP) patterns and clinical outcomes in a contemporary cohort of adult heart transplant recipients. METHODS: This retrospective, cross-sectional study included adult heart transplant recipients at least 6 months post-transplant. Ambulatory BP measurements were recorded over 24 hours. Nondippers were defined as a decline in average nighttime BP ≤ 10% compared with daytime. Primary outcomes were the presence of end organ damage, that is, microalbuminuria, chronic kidney disease, and/or left ventricular hypertrophy. Secondary outcomes were measures of diastolic dysfunction (ie, mitral valve deceleration time, e/e', E/A, and isovolumetric relaxation time), microalbumin/creatinine ratio, eGFR, interventricular septal thickness, and left ventricular posterior wall thickness. RESULTS: Of 30 patients, 53.3% (n = 16) were systolic nondippers and 40% (n = 12) were diastolic nondippers. Diastolic nondippers had three times higher urine microalbumin/creatinine ratios than diastolic dippers (P = .03). Systolic nondippers had 16.3% lower mitral valve deceleration time (P = .05) than systolic dippers, while diastolic nondippers had 20.4% higher e/e' (P = .05) than diastolic dippers. There were no significant relationships between BP dipping status and any of the primary outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that systolic and diastolic nondipping BP patterns are associated with subclinical kidney damage and diastolic dysfunction in heart transplant recipients.  
Surgical Outcomes for Native Valve Endocarditis.  ;"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the short-term and long-term results of surgical treatment for native valve endocarditis (NVE) and to investigate the risk factors associated with mortality. METHODS: Data including patients' characteristics, operative findings, postoperative results, and survival indices were retrospectively obtained from Hallym University Sacred Heart Hospital. RESULTS: A total of 29 patients underwent surgery for NVE (affecting the mitral valve in 20 patients and the aortic valve in 9) between 2003 and 2017. During the follow-up period (median, 46.9 months; interquartile range, 19.1-107.0 months), the 5-year survival rate was 77.2%. In logistic regression analysis, body mass index (p=0.031; odds ratio [OR], 0.574; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.346-0.951), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (p=0.026; OR, 24.0; 95% CI, 1.459-394.8), and urgent surgery (p=0.010; OR, 34.5; 95% CI, 2.353-505.7) were significantly associated with in-hospital mortality. Based on Cox proportional hazard regression analysis, the statistically significant predictors of long-term outcomes were hypertension, ESRD, and urgent surgery. CONCLUSION: Surgical treatment for NVE is associated with considerable mortality. The in-hospital mortality and 5-year survival rates of this study were 13.8% and 77.2%, respectively. Underlying conditions, including hypertension and ESRD, and urgent surgery were independent risk factors for unfavorable outcomes.  "
Meta-Analysis of Transcatheter Versus Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement in Low Surgical Risk Patients.  ;Current guidelines recommend transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) for patients with severe aortic stenosis at elevated surgical risk, but not for patients at low surgical risk. Our objective is to compare major clinical outcomes and procedural complications with TAVI versus surgical aortic valve replacement in patients with severe aortic stenosis at low surgical risk. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials, identified through a systematic search of the MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane databases. Count data were pooled across trials using random-effects models with inverse variance weighting to obtain relative risks (RRs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Three randomized controlled trials (n = 2,629) were included. At 30 days, TAVI was associated with a substantial reduction in all-cause mortality (RR: 0.45, 95%CI: 0.20 to 0.99), atrial fibrillation (RR: 0.27, 95%CI: 0.17 to 0.41), life threatening/disabling bleeding (RR: 0.29, 95%CI: 0.12 to 0.69), and acute kidney injury (RR: 0.28, 95%CI: 0.14 to 0.57). The reduction in atrial fibrillation persisted at 12 months (RR: 0.32, 95%CI: 0.21 to 0.49). However, TAVI patients had an increased risk of permanent pacemaker implantation at both 30 days (RR: 3.13, 95%CI: 1.36 to 7.21) and 12 months (RR: 2.99, 95%CI: 1.19 to 7.51). Due to the low absolute numbers of events, results were inconclusive at 30 days and 12 months for cardiovascular mortality, stroke, transient ischemic attack, and myocardial infarction. In conclusion, while some outcomes remained inconclusive, these data suggest that TAVI should be considered as a first-line therapy for the treatment of severe aortic stenosis in low surgical risk patients.  
Cardiac Valvular Lesions due to Kawasaki Disease: A Japanese Nationwide Survey.  ;OBJECTIVES: To clarify the characteristics of valvular lesions after Kawasaki disease with a Japanese nationwide survey. STUDY DESIGN: Among 137 026 patients in the nationwide Japanese surveys between 2007 and 2016, 290 (0.2%) with valvular sequelae were investigated by questionnaires. RESULTS: Among the 290 patients with valvular sequelae, mitral regurgitation (MR), tricuspid regurgitation, aortic regurgitation, and pulmonary regurgitation were present 1 month after the development of Kawasaki disease in 183 (63%), 112 (39%), 39 (13%), and 49 (17%) patients, respectively. The numbers of patients with MR during the acute phase and 1 year after developing Kawasaki disease were 208 (72%) and 95 (33%), respectively. MR improved significantly during the late period (P < .0001). Although aortic regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation also improved significantly (P < .001), pulmonary regurgitation did not change. Ruptured mitral valves chordae tendineae occurred in 6 infants by 6 months of age, within 4 months after the onset of Kawasaki disease. Three patients needed mitral valve plasty, and 1 patient died of acute heart failure. Another 4-month-old girl died of an acute myocardial infarction with MR. In the acute phase, there was a significant difference in the MR severity between the intravenous immunoglobulin-responder group and the intravenous immunoglobulin-resistant group (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: The inflammation caused by acute Kawasaki disease affects the function of the mitral valves. Most cases of MR improve with the alleviation of inflammation. Severe MR may have decreased with the development of treatment for acute vasculitis. However, ruptured mitral valves chordae tendineae rarely occurs in infants younger than 6 months old, within 4 months after Kawasaki disease.  
Circulating and tissue matricellular RNA and protein expression in calcific aortic valve disease.  ;"Aortic valve sclerosis is a highly prevalent, poorly characterized asymptomatic manifestation of calcific aortic valve disease and may represent a therapeutic target for disease mitigation. Human aortic valve cusps and blood were obtained from 333 patients undergoing cardiac surgery (n = 236 for severe aortic stenosis, n = 35 for asymptomatic aortic valve sclerosis, n = 62 for no valvular disease), and a multiplex assay was used to evaluate protein expression across the spectrum of calcific aortic valve disease. A subset of six valvular tissue samples (n = 3 for asymptomatic aortic valve sclerosis, n = 3 for severe aortic stenosis) was used to create RNA sequencing profiles, which were subsequently organized into clinically relevant gene modules. RNA sequencing identified 182 protein-encoding, differentially expressed genes in aortic valve sclerosis vs. aortic stenosis; 85% and 89% of expressed genes overlapped in aortic stenosis and aortic valve sclerosis, respectively, which decreased to 55% and 84% when we targeted highly expressed genes. Bioinformatic analyses identified six differentially expressed genes encoding key extracellular matrix regulators: TBHS2, SPARC, COL1A2, COL1A1, SPP1, and CTGF. Differential expression of key circulating biomarkers of extracellular matrix reorganization was observed in control vs. aortic valve sclerosis (osteopontin), control vs. aortic stenosis (osteoprotegerin), and aortic valve sclerosis vs. aortic stenosis groups (MMP-2), which corresponded to valvular mRNA expression. We demonstrate distinct mRNA and protein expression underlying aortic valve sclerosis and aortic stenosis. We anticipate that extracellular matrix regulators can serve as circulating biomarkers of early calcific aortic valve disease and as novel targets for early disease mitigation, pending prospective clinical investigations.

Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging Features in Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Diagnosed at <21 Years of Age.  ;"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HC) is the most common inherited cardiomyopathy, with varied timing of phenotypic and clinical presentation. Literature describing cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) in young patients with HC is limited. This study included patients diagnosed with HC at young age (<21 years) between January 1990 and January 2015 who underwent transthoracic echocardiography and CMR with assessment of LGE at a single tertiary referral center. LGE was quantified via a method of 6 standard deviations and patients were grouped based upon presence or absence of LGE (≤1% and >1% LGE, respectively). Sudden cardiac death (SCD) risk was assessed in patients >16 years of age using the European SCD risk score. A composite outcome of New York Heart Association class III-IV symptoms, aborted SCD, heart transplantation, and all-cause mortality was assessed via Kaplan-Meier curves with log-rank analysis. Overall, 126 patients were included (78 male; 62%). Median age of diagnosis was 15 (12 to 18) years. LGE was present in 81 (64%) patients, although only 4 (3%) patients had LGE >15%. Median age at CMR imaging was 19 (15 to 23) years. Patients with LGE had greater wall thickness (25 ± 8 mm vs 22 ± 7 mm, p = 0.01). Median European SCD risk score was 4.7 (2.9 to 6.5). Median follow-up was 6.5 (2.5 to 13) years with 26 patients (21%) meeting the composite outcome. There were no significant differences in composite outcome since age of diagnosis when stratified by presence/absence of LGE (p = 1.0). The presence of LGE in young HC patients was not an independent risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Wall thickness was greater in patients with LGE. There remains a need for further evaluation of this unique HC cohort.  "
Long-Term Follow-Up of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation With Portico Versus Evolut Devices.  ;New-generation devices such as Evolut and Portico have provided favorable results in patients who underwent transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) for aortic stenosis, but their comparative effectiveness remains debated, despite its relevance when envisioning TAVI in low-risk patients. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of 2 leading TAVI devices (Evolut and Portico) used by the same team of experienced TAVI operators, focusing on long-term outcomes, including major adverse events (i.e., the composite of death, stroke, myocardial infarction, major vascular complication, or major bleeding). Unadjusted and propensity score-adjusted analyses were carried out. A total of 233 patients were included, 119 (51.1%) receiving Evolut and 114 (49%) Portico. Baseline and procedural data showed significant between-device differences, including functional class, surgical risk, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, renal function, transesophageal guidance, device size, postdilation, and procedural time (all p <0.05). Yet, acute and in-hospital outcomes were not significantly different (all p >0.05). Follow-up status was ascertained in 228 (98%) patients after 15.0 ± 7.6 months. Unadjusted analysis showed similar rates of major adverse events, as well as the individual risk of death, stroke, myocardial infarction, major vascular complication, major bleeding, and pacemaker implantation (all p >0.05). Even at propensity score-adjusted analysis outcomes were not significantly different with Evolut and Portico (all p >0.05). In conclusion, Evolut and Portico devices yield similarly favorable results at long-term follow-up when used by experienced TAVI operators.  
Coronary Artery Disease Assessed by Computed Tomography-Based Leaman Score in Patients With Low-Risk Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.  ;We aimed to evaluate the burden of coronary artery disease (CAD) using the computed tomography (CT) Leaman score in low-risk transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) patients. The extent of CAD in low-risk patients with aortic stenosis who are candidates for TAVI has not been accurately quantified. The CT Leaman score was developed to quantify coronary CT angiography (CCTA) atherosclerotic burden and has been validated to evaluate the extent of CAD. CT Leaman score >5 has been associated with an increase in major adverse cardiac events over long-term follow-up. The study population included patients enrolled in the Low Risk TAVI trial who underwent CCTA before the procedure. For the CT Leaman score, we used 3 sets of weighting factors: (1) location of coronary plaques, (2) type of plaque, and (3) degree of stenosis. A total of 200 patients were enrolled in the Low Risk TAVI trial. Excluded were 31 patients who had no analyzable CCTA imaging. For the remaining 169 patients, the mean CT Leaman score was 6.27 ± 0.27, of whom 102 (60.4%) had CT Leaman score >5. Nearly all analyzed patients (97%) had coronary plaques. Furthermore, 33 patients (19.5%) had potentially obstructive coronary plaques (>50% stenosis by CCTA) in proximal segments. Most low-risk TAVI patients have significant CAD burden by CCTA. It should be a priority for future TAVI devices to guarantee unimpeded access to the coronary arteries for selective angiography and interventions.  
Femoral transcatheter valve-in-valve implantation as alternative strategy for failed aortic bioprostheses: A single-centre experience with long-term follow-up.  ;BACKGROUND: Surgical reoperation is still a standard procedure performed for degenerated aortic bioprostheses. On the other hand femoral minimally invasive valve-in-valve implantation (femTAVI-VIV) is an intriguing alternative. This clinical study was design to compare the early and late outcomes of redo-surgery (Redo-AVR) and femTAVI-VIV procedures for failed aortic bioprostheses. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 108 patients with degenerated aortic bioprostheses qualified for isolated Redo-AVR (n = 40) or femTAVI-VIV (n = 68) between 2003 and 2018. Both cohorts were divided into intermediate and high-risk groups according to the EuroSCORE II (4-9% and >9%). Propensity score matching selected 20 pairs in Intermediate-risk group and 10 pairs in High-risk group for the final comparison. RESULTS: Patients qualified for femTAVI-VIV were older (79.2 vs 72.9 years, p < 0.001) and at higher risk (EuroSCORE II 10.9 vs 7.8%, p = 0.005) than Redo-AVR subjects. Overall survival in femTAVI-VIV and Redo-AVR was comparable at 30-days, 1- and 5-years, respectively (92.6% vs 92.5%, 85.2% vs 85.0% and 62.9% vs 72.5%, p = 0.287). After PSM no differences in mortality, myocardial infarction, pacemaker implantation, stroke or acute renal insufficiency were found. Transcatheter procedure was associated with shorter hospital stay, lower rate of blood products transfusions and higher incidence of mild paravalvular leaks. CONCLUSION: Our study supports the opinion that transcatheter approach for treatment of patients with degenerated aortic bioprostheses is a safe alternative to Redo-AVR procedures particularly for those at high-risk.

Multicenter Comparison of Percutaneous and Surgical Pulmonary Valve Replacement in Large RVOT.  ;"BACKGROUND: A percutaneous approach for pulmonary valve replacement (PVR) is a feasible alternative to surgical PVR in selected patients with severe pulmonary regurgitation after repair of tetralogy of Fallot. However, large right ventricular outflow tract (diameter ≥ 25 mm) remains challenging. METHODS: This retrospective multicenter study enrolled consecutive patients with large right ventricular outflow tract who underwent percutaneous PVR (Venus P-valve, Venus MedTech Inc, Hangzhou, China) (n = 35) or surgical PVR (homograft valve; n = 30) between May 2014 and April 2017. Patients were followed up at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months, and yearly thereafter. Main study outcomes were pulmonary valve function and right ventricular function at discharge and midterm follow-up. RESULTS: PVR was successful in all patients. Percutaneous compared with surgical PVR group had: similarly distributed baseline characteristics; shorter hospitalization, intensive care unit stay, and endotracheal intubation duration; lower cost; lower pulmonary valve gradient before discharge; lower pulmonary valve regurgitant grade (mean difference, -0.63; 95% CI -1.11 to -0.20, P = .022), pulmonary valve gradient (mean difference, -5.7 mm Hg; 95% CI -9.4 to -2.2 mm Hg, P = .005), and right ventricular end-diastolic volume index (mean difference, -9.5 mL/m2; 95% CI -16.9 to -3.1 mL/m2, P = .022); and greater right ventricular ejection fraction (mean difference, 5.4%; 95% CI 2.4%-8.3%, P = .002) at median 36 months follow-up, without deaths in either group. CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous PVR using Venus P-valve appeared to be a safe, efficacious and minimally invasive alternative to surgical PVR in selected patients with large right ventricular outflow tract yielding better right ventricular and pulmonary valve function at midterm follow-up.

Left Ventricular Strain Normalizes After Balloon Aortic Valvuloplasty in Infants with Congenital Aortic Stenosis.  ;"Severe aortic stenosis (AS) causes left ventricular (LV) afterload and subendocardial ischemia. Despite this, most infants with AS have normal LV ejection fraction (EF). Strain analysis using two-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography (2DSTE) may identify more sensitive markers of systolic dysfunction. We sought to show changes in LV strain after balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV) in infants with AS. Twenty-seven infants ≤ 1 year of age with AS who underwent BAV from 2007 to 2017 were included. Echocardiograms before/after BAV were retrospectively analyzed with 2DSTE. Median age was 29 days (interquartile range 3-52) and LV EF was 64 ± 10%. Global longitudinal strain (GLS) significantly improved post-BAV (- 17 ± 5 vs. - 20 ± 4%, p = 0.001) with no difference in global circumferential strain. Peak longitudinal strain was abnormal at the inferoseptal base and mid-ventricle (- 15 ± 6 and - 17 ± 5 = 7%, respectively) and significantly improved in the basal and mid-anterolateral segments (- 17 ± 5 vs. - 21 ± 5%, p < 0.01; - 17 ± 6% vs. - 20 ± 5%, p = 0.01, respectively). Five (20%) patients underwent reintervention, and had significantly higher peak-to-peak pre and post-BAV AS gradients (86 ± 14 vs. 61 ± 20 mmHg, p = 0.02; 33 ± 17 vs. 21 ± 10 mmHg, p = 0.04, respectively). In conclusion, longitudinal strain is abnormal in infants with AS and improves to previously published normal values after BAV.  "
Systemic septic emboli in tricuspid endocarditis due to an atrial communication with a right-to-left shunt.  ;We present the case of a patient admitted to hospital in septic shock. He had a history of tricuspid valve infective endocarditis (IE) 6 months prior and regularly injected intravenous drugs. A bedside echo on arrival confirmed vegetations on his tricuspid valve, torrential tricuspid regurgitation and signs of significantly raised right-sided pressures. The admission chest radiograph showed consolidative changes in the lungs, suggestive of septic pulmonary emboli. He was commenced on antibiotics and treated in the high-dependency unit. He subsequently developed an acutely ischaemic right foot and nasal tip. Suspicions were raised of a paradoxical septic embolus through a right-to-left shunt, subsequently confirmed on bubble echo which showed passage of agitated saline between the atria. This was not apparent clinically or on echocardiogram during his previous episode of tricuspid valve IE, raising the possibility of the development of an acquired inter-atrial communication since his previous episode.  
Outcomes after combined percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty and external beam radiation therapy for the treatment of congenital pulmonic stenosis in four dogs.  ;Valve restenosis after percutaneous balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty (BPV) for the treatment of congenital pulmonic stenosis (PS) may occur in up to 17% of canine cases. Outcomes in dogs with PS that are treated with repeat BPV after restenosis have not been described. The present report details the clinical courses of four dogs with congenital PS, previously treated with conventional BPV and atenolol (n = 4) or atenolol alone (n = 1), two with anomalous, circumpulmonary coronary artery anatomy, which underwent BPV followed immediately by external beam radiation therapy (BPV + EBRT) to prevent valve restenosis. External beam radiation therapy involved five daily fractions of 3.6 Gray to the pulmonic valve. Echocardiographic and clinical follow-up information for 2-4 years after BPV + EBRT is presented. Three dogs experienced long-term reduction in transpulmonic pressure gradient. In one dog, which was treated with conservative BPV + EBRT as first-line therapy, return of transpulmonic pressure gradient to pretreatment levels was noted by 7 months after BPV + EBRT. Although clinical benefit remains unproven, the addition of EBRT to conventional BPV may be a treatment option for dogs experiencing restenosis after BPV or those in which restenosis is considered likely. Further study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this approach is needed.  
Comparison of Valve Durability and Outcomes of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation Versus Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement in Patients With Severe Symptomatic Aortic Stenosis and Less-Than-High-Risk for Surgery.  ;"This study aimed to investigate the rate of severe structural valve deterioration (SVD) and long-term outcomes of patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) or surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). Propensity score matched analysis of patients who underwent TAVI (n = 216) and SAVR (n = 216) between 2008 and 2012. Long-term echocardiographic parameters and clinical outcomes were assessed after more than 6 years after TAVI/SAVR. Rate of severe SVD was 10.5% versus 4.5% in the TAVI and SAVR groups, respectively, but the difference was not statistically significant (hazard ratio [HR] 2.5; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.7 to 8.3; p = 0.159). This was largely driven by higher rates of mean transprosthetic gradient ≥40 mm Hg (7.0 vs 3.4%; p = 0.327) and aortic regurgitation (4.7% vs 0%; p = 0.058). TAVI patients had lower survival rates at 6 years than SAVR patients (40.7% vs 59.6%, respectively, p <0.001, HR 2.15; 95% CI 1.45 to 3.20). Rate of cardiovascular events (14.4% TAVI vs 18.2% SAVR, HR 0.8; 95% CI 0.4 to 1.3; p = 0.347) and permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI; 16.0% TAVI vs 9.2% SAVR, p = 0.234) was similar between the 2 groups. In conclusion, incidence of moderate and severe SVD was not statistically different between TAVI and SAVR. Rate of moderate or severe aortic regurgitation was significantly higher in the TAVI group with predominant use of first-generation valves. Reintervention rate was low in both groups. Survival rate was lower after TAVI, probably because of higher frailty index, but incidence of cardiovascular events, PPI, and SVD was similar in both groups.  "
Meta-Analysis Comparing Percutaneous to Surgical Access in Trans-Femoral Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.  ;"To compare the outcomes in trans-femoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TF-TAVI) performed with percutaneous approach (PC) versus surgical cut-down (SC). In 13 trials including 5,859 patients (PC = 3447, SC = 2412), the outcomes based on Valve Academic Research Consortium criteria were compared between PC and SC in TF-TAVI. Compared with SC, PC was associated with similar major vascular complications (VCs) (8.7% vs 8.5%; odds ratio [OR] = 0.93, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.76 to 1.15, p = 0.53), major bleeding (OR = 1.09, 95% CI = 0.66 to 1.8, p = 0.73), perioperative mortality (5.7% vs 5.2%; OR = 1.13, 95% CI = 0.85 to 1.49, p = 0.4), urgent surgical repair (OR = 1.27, 95% CI = 0.81 to 2.02, p = 0.3), stroke (3.3% vs 3.9%; OR = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.53 to 1.36, p = 0.5), myocardial infarction (1.3% vs 1.1%; OR = 1.06, 95% CI = 0.53 to 2.12, p = 0.86), and renal failure (5.2% vs 5.9%; OR = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.38 to 1.22, p = 0.2), but shorter hospital stay (9.1 ± 8.5 vs 9.6 ± 9.5 days; mean difference = -1.07 day, 95% CI = -2.0 to -0.15, p = 0.02) and less blood transfusion (18.5% vs 25.7%; OR = 0.61, 95% CI = 0.43-0.86, p = 0.005). Minor VCs occurred more frequently in PC compared to SC (11.9% vs 6.9%; OR = 1.67, 95% CI = 1.04-2.67, p = 0.03). In conclusion, in TF-TAVI, PC is a safe and feasible alternative to SC, and adopting either approach depends on operator experience after ensuring that vascular access could be safely achieved with that specific technique.

Reccurent thrombus in the gigantic left atrium during effective anticoagulant therapy: case report.  ;"BACKGROUND: Gigantic left atrium is defined in the current literature as an excessive dilatation of the left atrium above 65mm. Chronic mitral valve disease is associated with the development of thrombus in the left atrium in up to 19% of all cases of mitral insufficiency and appropriate treatment must be initiated to prevent thromboembolic events. In order to diagnose thrombi in the left atrium or left atrial appendage, various imaging methods may be used, including cardiac magnetic resonance. CASE PRESENTATION: The case report describes a 73-year-old male who developed recurrent sessile thrombus on the posterior wall of the gigantic left atrium. A large thrombus was first detected following mitral valve surgery despite effective vitamin K antagonist anticoagulation therapy. Echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance were used within the diagnostic procedure and to monitor the treatment outcomes. Cardiac magnetic resonance was shown to be beneficial as it provided a more precise description of the intra-atrial masses located on the posterior left atrial wall, and in such situations, is of greater benefit than standard echocardiography. This led to the surgical removal of the intra-atrial mass; nevertheless, it was quickly followed by the recurrence of the thrombus. The anticoagulant therapy was adjusted and fortified by the introduction of acetylsalicylic acid and sequentially clopidogrel, but this also did not resolve the thrombus formation. Finally, employing a combination of rivaroxaban and clopidogrel resulted in partial thrombus regression. Therefore, various pathophysiological aspects of thrombus formation and used anticoagulation strategies are discussed. CONCLUSIONS: We describe a unique case of a recurrent thrombus located on the posterior wall of the gigantic left atrium. Cardiac magnetic resonance was shown to be beneficial in providing a more precise description of the intra-atrial masses located on the posterior left atrial wall as compared to standard echocardiographic examination. Development of a thrombus after mitral valve surgery despite effective anticoagulant therapy and its final resolution by introducing a combination of rivaroxaban and clopidogrel highlights the complex etiopathogenesis of thrombus formation. This supports the potential use of this combination in tailoring an individual personalized therapy for patients with recurrent atrial thrombi.  "
Diagnosis, treatment & management of prosthetic valve thrombosis: the key considerations.  ;Introduction: Prosthetic heart valve thrombosis is a life-threatening complication after valve replacement surgery. Although subtherapeutic anticoagulation is the main cause, there are many other conventional and esoteric predisposing factors.Areas covered: The etiopathogenesis, diagnosis, and management of prosthetic heart valve thrombosis with particular focus on conventional and esoteric predisposing factors, diagnosis with multimodality imaging and current therapeutic approaches were covered.Expert opinion: Subtherapeutic anticoagulation remains the key driving force for the development of prosthetic valve thrombosis. However, cardiologists should be cognizant of other frequent or rare conventional and esoteric causes. The diagnosis is now more straightforward with the use of multimodality imaging. Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography with or without real-time three-dimensional imaging are the current gold standard modalities. Multidetector computed tomography is now a major complementary tool. The favorable clinical outcomes with recently introduced slow or ultra-slow infusions of alteplase, as compared to relatively poor surgical results, have rendered thrombolytic therapy the first-line treatment option in most eligible patients with prosthetic valve thrombosis. Surgical treatment could be reserved in whom thrombolytic therapy is contraindicated or has already failed. The efficacy and safety of thrombolytic therapy as compared to surgery should be confirmed with large observational cohorts, and ideally randomized trials.  
Angiotensin-(1-7) reduces doxorubicin-induced cardiac dysfunction in male and female Sprague-Dawley rats through antioxidant mechanisms.  ;"Doxorubicin (Dox) is an effective chemotherapeutic for a variety of pediatric malignancies. Unfortunately, Dox administration often results in a cumulative dose-dependent cardiotoxicity that manifests with marked oxidative stress, leading to heart failure. Adjunct therapies are needed to mitigate Dox cardiotoxicity and enhance quality of life in pediatric patients with cancer. Angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)] is an endogenous hormone with cardioprotective properties. This study investigated whether adjunct Ang-(1-7) attenuates cardiotoxicity resulting from exposure to Dox in male and female juvenile rats. Dox significantly reduced body mass, and the addition of Ang-(1-7) had no effect. However, adjunct Ang-(1-7) prevented Dox-mediated diastolic dysfunction, including markers of decreased passive filling as measured by reduced early diastole mitral valve flow velocity peak (E) (P < 0.05) and early diastole mitral valve annulus peak velocity (e'; P < 0.001) and increased E/e' (P < 0.001), an echocardiographic measure of diastolic dysfunction. Since Dox treatment increases reactive oxygen species (ROS), the effect of Ang-(1-7) on oxidative by-products and enzymes that generate or reduce ROS was investigated. In hearts of male and female juvenile rats, Dox increased NADPH oxidase 4 (P < 0.05), a major cardiovascular NADPH oxidase isozyme that generates ROS, as well as 4-hydroxynonenal (P < 0.001) and malondialdehyde (P < 0.001), markers of lipid peroxidation; Ang-(1-7) prevented these effects of Dox. Cotreatment with Dox and Ang-(1-7) increased the antioxidant enzymes SOD1 (male: P < 0.05; female: P < 0.01) and catalase (P < 0.05), which likely contributed to reduced ROS. These results demonstrate that Ang-(1-7) prevents diastolic dysfunction in association with a reduction in ROS, suggesting that the heptapeptide hormone may serve as an effective adjuvant to improve Dox-induced cardiotoxicity.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Ang-(1-7) is a clinically safe peptide hormone with cardioprotective and antineoplastic properties that could be used as an adjuvant therapy to improve cancer treatment and mitigate the long-term cardiotoxicity associated with doxorubicin in pediatric patients with cancer.

Mavacamten rescues increased myofilament calcium sensitivity and dysregulation of Ca(2+) flux caused by thin filament hypertrophic cardiomyopathy mutations.  ;Thin filament hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) mutations increase myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity and alter Ca2+ handling and buffering. The myosin inhibitor mavacamten reverses the increased contractility caused by HCM thick filament mutations, and we here test its effect on HCM thin filament mutations where the mode of action is not known. Mavacamten (250 nM) partially reversed the increased Ca2+ sensitivity caused by HCM mutations Cardiac troponin T (cTnT) R92Q, and cardiac troponin I (cTnI) R145G in in vitro ATPase assays. The effect of mavacamten was also analyzed in cardiomyocyte models of cTnT R92Q and cTnI R145G containing cytoplasmic and myofilament specific Ca2+ sensors. While mavacamten rescued the hypercontracted basal sarcomere length, the reduced fractional shortening did not improve with mavacamten. Both mutations caused an increase in peak systolic Ca2+ detected at the myofilament, and this was completely rescued by 250 nM mavacamten. Systolic Ca2+ detected by the cytoplasmic sensor was also reduced by mavacamten treatment, although only R145G increased cytoplasmic Ca2+. There was also a reversal of Ca2+ decay time prolongation caused by both mutations at the myofilament but not in the cytoplasm. We thus show that mavacamten reverses some of the Ca2+-sensitive molecular and cellular changes caused by the HCM mutations, particularly altered Ca2+ flux at the myofilament. The reduction of peak systolic Ca2+ as a consequence of mavacamten treatment represents a novel mechanism by which the compound is able to reduce contractility, working synergistically with its direct effect on the myosin motor.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Mavacamten, a myosin inhibitor, is currently in phase-3 clinical trials as a pharmacotherapy for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Its efficacy in HCM caused by mutations in thin filament proteins is not known. We show in reductionist and cellular models that mavacamten can rescue the effects of thin filament mutations on calcium sensitivity and calcium handling although it only partially rescues the contractile cellular phenotype and, in some cases, exacerbates the effect of the mutation.  
Association of Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy With Outcomes Following Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.  ;This cohort study investigates the association of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy with outcomes following transcatheter aortic valve replacement.  
Interventional procedures versus medical therapy alone: outcome of cardiac patient management. A systematic review.  ;BACKGROUND: Cardiac patients are managed medically or with an intervention. This review aims to explore the survival benefit of each approach in the management of cardiac patients. METHODS: We reviewed updated evidence of survival benefit from the most recent trials and guidelines. RESULTS: Patients with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) have a mortality benefit when a Primary Cardiac Intervention is implemented. No similar benefit has been shown in chronic stable coronary artery disease. Heart failure patients show a mortality benefit using medication and similarly, mild or moderate valve disease patients do not require an intervention. In atrial fibrillation, the CABANA trial using ablation therapy, had no mortality benefit. Hypertension drug therapy showed a significant mortality benefit, a similar benefit was noted with drug therapy for the treatment of dyslipidemia, when achieving the target lipid goal. CONCLUSIONS: Not all interventional procedures result in a mortality benefit. Medical therapy alone increases survival in many cardiac diseases.  
Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Valve in Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Valve for Severe Periprosthetic Regurgitation.  ;The management of postprocedure severe aortic periprosthetic regurgitation after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is unknown. While valve-in-valve TAVR has been associated with favorable outcomes for degenerative surgically implanted bioprosthetic valves, there are no evidence-based guidelines for immediate TAVR valve in TAVR valve for periprosthetic regurgitation. We present a patient who underwent a TAVR valve in TAVR valve implantation within 48 h of her first procedure and showed a good response.  
Association of Novel Streptococcus sanguinis Virulence Factors With Pathogenesis in a Native Valve Infective Endocarditis Model.  ;Streptococcus sanguinis (S. sanguinis) is an abundant oral commensal which can cause disseminated human infection if it gains access to the bloodstream. The most important among these diseases is infective endocarditis (IE). While virulence phenotypes of S. sanguinis have been correlated to disease severity, genetic factors mediating these phenotypes, and contributing to pathogenesis are largely uncharacterized. In this report, we investigate the roles of 128 genes in virulence-related phenotypes of S. sanguinis and characterize the pathogenic potential of two selected mutants in a left-sided, native valve IE rabbit model. Assays determining the ability of our mutant strains to produce a biofilm, bind to and aggregate platelets, and adhere to or invade endothelial cells identified sixteen genes with novel association to these phenotypes. These results suggest the presence of many uncharacterized genes involved in IE pathogenesis which may be relevant for disease progression. Two mutants identified by the above screening process - SSA_1099, encoding an RTX-like protein, and mur2, encoding a peptidoglycan hydrolase - were subsequently evaluated in vivo. Wild type (WT) S. sanguinis reliably induced cardiac vegetations, while the SSA_1099 and mur2 mutants produced either no vegetation or vegetations of small size. Splenomegaly was reduced in both mutant strains compared to WT, while pathology of other distal organs was indistinguishable. Histopathology analyses suggest the cardiac lesions and vegetations in this model resemble those observed in humans. These data indicate that SSA_1099 and mur2 encode virulence factors in S. sanguinis which are integral to pathogenesis of IE.  
Right ventricular outflow tract prestenting with AndraStent XXL before percutaneous pulmonary valve implantation.  ;BACKGROUND: The indications for percutaneous pulmonary valve implantation (PPVI) have been extended to include large dysfunctional right ventricular outflow tracts (RVOTs). Prestenting of the RVOT is commonly performed before PPVI in order to ensure a stable landing zone. The AndraStent XXL (AndraMed GmbH, Reutlingen, Germany), a cobalt-chromium stent with semi-open cell design, has unique mechanical properties in this indication but is no longer available in France. AIMS: To assess the efficiency of AndraStent XXL before PPVI. METHODS: In this retrospective multicentre cohort study, 86 AndraStents XXL were implanted in 77 patients in 6 centres. RESULTS: PPVI was indicated mainly for pulmonary regurgitation (75.3%) in native or patched RVOT (88.3%). The stents were manually mounted on balloon catheters and delivered through sheaths using a conventional femoral approach. PPVI was performed successfully in 97.4% of patients after successful prestenting, generally during the same procedure (77.9%). There were no deaths associated with stent implantation, and four patients experienced five complications, mainly stent embolization, including one requiring surgery. Neither stent fracture nor dysfunction were observed in any patient during a mean follow-up of 19.2±8.7months. Stent analysis showed an excellent maximal stent expansion (97.1%) regardless of balloon size. A 22.3%±3.4 stent shortening with a 30mm balloon was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Implantation of large cobalt-chromium AndraStent XXL stents is efficient for prestenting before PPVI.  
Effect of Ventricular Pacing on Morbidity in Adults After Fontan Repair.  ;"Implantation of a permanent pacemaker is a negative prognostic marker in patients with Fontan palliation; however, data delineating outcomes in adult patients with pacemaker requirements are lacking. We hypothesize that high ventricular pacing burden is associated with adverse outcomes in adult Fontan patients. We performed a retrospective review comprising adult patients with history of Fontan repair. A high burden of ventricular pacing was defined as ≥40% pacing. Major adverse clinical events (MACE) were defined as all-cause mortality or need for advanced cardiac therapies (ventricular assist device or heart transplant). A total of 145 adult patients with Fontan were studied for a median of 3.1 years. Twenty (14%) patients had implanted pacemakers with ≥40% ventricular pacing. Twelve events occurred in those with ≥40% ventricular pacing (incidence 60.0%) versus 11 in those without (incidence 8.8%). In multivariable analysis, ≥40% ventricular-pacing (odds ratio 12.51, confidence interval [CI] 3.56 to 43.83, p <0.001) was associated with MACE independent of initial Fontan type, New York Heart Association functional class at baseline, or history of atrial tachyarrythmia. In survival analysis, patients with ≥40% ventricular pacing had nearly 8 times the risk of MACE compared with those with a lower ventricular pacing burden (hazard ratio 7.79, 95% CI 2.56 to 23.66, p <0.001), whereas patients with atrial-only or <40% ventricular pacing burden had a trend toward higher hazard of MACE compared with those without permanent pacemaker (hazard ratio 3.38, 95% CI 0.92 to 12.47, p = 0.07) that did not meet statistical significance. These findings suggest that high ventricular pacing burden contributes to poor outcomes in the adult Fontan patients and bear consideration when determining optimal treatment of tachyarrhythmias in this population.

Bicuspid Aortic Valve in 2 Model Species and Review of the Literature.  ;Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is the most common human congenital cardiac malformation. Although the etiology is unknown for most patients, formation of the 2 main BAV anatomic types (A and B) has been shown to rely on distinct morphogenetic mechanisms. Animal models of BAV include 2 spontaneous hamster strains and 27 genetically modified mouse strains. To assess the value of these models for extrapolation to humans, we examined the aortic valve anatomy of 4340 hamsters and 1823 mice from 8 and 7 unmodified strains, respectively. In addition, we reviewed the literature describing BAV in nonhuman mammals. The incidences of BAV types A and B were 2.3% and 0.03% in control hamsters and 0% and 0.3% in control mice, respectively. Hamsters from the spontaneous model had BAV type A only, whereas mice from 2 of 27 genetically modified strains had BAV type A, 23 of 27 had BAV type B, and 2 of 27 had both BAV types. In both species, BAV incidence was dependent on genetic background. Unlike mice, hamsters had a wide spectrum of aortic valve morphologies. We showed interspecific differences in the occurrence of BAV between humans, hamsters, and mice that should be considered when studying aortic valve disease using animal models. Our results suggest that genetic modifiers play a significant role in both the morphology and incidence of BAV. We propose that mutations causing anomalies in specific cardiac morphogenetic processes or cell lineages may lead to BAV types A, B, or both, depending on additional genetic, environmental, and epigenetic factors.

Angiocrine FSTL1 (Follistatin-Like Protein 1) Insufficiency Leads to Atrial and Venous Wall Fibrosis via SMAD3 Activation.  ;OBJECTIVE: Angiocrine factors, mediating the endothelial-mural cell interaction in vascular wall construction as well as maintenance, are incompletely characterized. This study aims to investigate the role of endothelial cell-derived FSTL1 (follistatin-like protein 1) in vascular homeostasis. Approach and Results: Using conditional knockout mouse models, we show that loss of FSTL1 in endothelial cells (Fstl1ECKO) led to an increase of pulmonary vascular resistance, resulting in the heart regurgitation especially with tricuspid valves. However, this abnormality was not detected in mutant mice with Fstl1 knockout in smooth muscle cells or hematopoietic cells. We further showed that there was excessive αSMA (α-smooth muscle actin) associated with atrial endocardia, heart valves, veins, and microvessels after the endothelial FSTL1 deletion. There was also an increase in collagen deposition, as demonstrated in livers of Fstl1ECKO mutants. The SMAD3 (mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 3) phosphorylation (pSMAD3) was significantly enhanced, and pSMAD3 staining was colocalized with αSMA in vein walls, suggesting the activation of TGFβ (transforming growth factor β) signaling in vascular mural cells of Fstl1ECKO mice. Consistently, treatment with a TGFβ pathway inhibitor reduced the abnormal association of αSMA with the atria and blood vessels in Fstl1ECKO mutant mice. CONCLUSIONS: The findings imply that endothelial FSTL1 is critical for the homeostasis of vascular walls, and its insufficiency may favor cardiovascular fibrosis leading to heart failure.

Vascular complications during transcatheter aortic valve implantation: The role of the vascular surgeon.  ;"INTRODUCTION: This study compares the incidence of vascular complications and other major outcomes between patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation, with and without a standardized preoperative vascular surgeon consultation. METHODS: This retrospective study evaluated all patients scheduled for transcatheter aortic valve implantation during a five-year period at a Hellenic University Hospital. Two main periods were evaluated: Group A (early period (2014-2015), without a standardized preoperative vascular surgeon consultation) and Group B (late period (2016-2018), with a standardized preoperative vascular surgeon consultation). All vascular complications as well as other major outcomes (early death, stroke, myocardial infarction, and treatment) were recorded. Univariate and multivariate analyses were also conducted. RESULTS: Overall, 382 transcatheter aortic valve implantation procedures were conducted (Group A: n = 115; duration = 19 months; Group B: n = 267; duration = 41 months). Overall, 58 vascular complications were recorded (21 patients in Group A and 37 patients in Group B (18.3% versus 13.9%; P = 0.279)). However, vascular complications that necessitated a vascular surgeon's interference were more frequent during the first period (13% versus 4.9%; P = 0.009). Among patients with a vascular complication, early mortality was higher during the first period (14.3% versus 0%; P = 0.034) although stroke and myocardial infarction rates were similar. Age >80 years (OR = 1.856 [1.134-3.452]; P = 0.03) and preoperative vascular surgeon consultation (OR = 0.345 [0.132-0.756]; P = 0.015) were the only independent predictors for vascular complications. CONCLUSIONS: A standardized preoperative evaluation by a vascular surgeon may decrease the risk for vascular complications that necessitate a repair as well as early mortality among patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation procedures.

Plasma lipids and risk of aortic valve stenosis: a Mendelian randomization study.  ;"AIMS: Aortic valve stenosis is commonly considered a degenerative disorder with no recommended preventive intervention, with only valve replacement surgery or catheter intervention as treatment options. We sought to assess the causal association between exposure to lipid levels and risk of aortic stenosis. METHODS AND RESULTS: Causality of association was assessed using two-sample Mendelian randomization framework through different statistical methods. We retrieved summary estimations of 157 genetic variants that have been shown to be associated with plasma lipid levels in the Global Lipids Genetics Consortium that included 188 577 participants, mostly European ancestry, and genetic association with aortic stenosis as the main outcome from a total of 432 173 participants in the UK Biobank. Secondary negative control outcomes included aortic regurgitation and mitral regurgitation. The odds ratio for developing aortic stenosis per unit increase in lipid parameter was 1.52 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.22-1.90; per 0.98 mmol/L] for low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, 1.03 (95% CI 0.80-1.31; per 0.41 mmol/L) for high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, and 1.38 (95% CI 0.92-2.07; per 1 mmol/L) for triglycerides. There was no evidence of a causal association between any of the lipid parameters and aortic or mitral regurgitation. CONCLUSION: Lifelong exposure to high LDL-cholesterol increases the risk of symptomatic aortic stenosis, suggesting that LDL-lowering treatment may be effective in its prevention.  "
In vitro Assessment of the Impacts of Leaflet Design on the Hemodynamic Characteristics of ePTFE Pulmonary Prosthetic Valves.  ;Prosthetic pulmonary valves are widely used in the management procedures of various congenital heart diseases, including the surgical pulmonary valve replacement (PVR) and right ventricular outflow tract reconstruction (RVOT). The discouraging long-term outcomes of standard prostheses, including homografts and bioprosthetic, constrained their indications. Recent developments in the expanded-polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) pulmonary prosthetic valves provide promising alternatives. In this study, the hemodynamic characteristics of bileaflet and trileaflet ePTFE valve designs were experimentally evaluated. The in vitro tests were performed under the right ventricle (RV) flow conditions by using an in vitro RV circulatory system and particle image velocimetry (PIV). The leaflet kinetics, trans-valvular pressure gradients, effective orifice areas, regurgitant fractions, energy losses, velocity fields, and Reynolds shear stress (RSS) in both prostheses were evaluated. The opening of the bileaflet and trileaflet valve takes 0.060 and 0.088 s, respectively. The closing of the former takes 0.140 s, in contrast to 0.176 s of the latter. The trans-valvular pressure is 6.8 mmHg in the bileaflet valve vs. 7.9 mmHg in the trileaflet valve. The effective orifice area is 1.83 cm2 in the bileaflet valve and 1.72 cm2 in the trileaflet valve. The regurgitant fraction and energy loss of bileaflet are 7.13% and 82 mJ, which are 7.84% and 101.64 mJ in its bileaflet counterpart. The maximum RSS of 48.0 and 49.2 Pa occur at the systole peak in the bileaflet and trileaflet valve, respectively. A higher average RSS level is found in the bileaflet valve. The results from this preliminary study indicate that the current bileaflet prosthetic valve design is capable of providing a better overall hemodynamic performance than the trileaflet design.  
A geometrically adaptable heart valve replacement.  ;"Congenital heart valve disease has life-threatening consequences that warrant early valve replacement; however, the development of a growth-accommodating prosthetic valve has remained elusive. Thousands of children continue to face multiple high-risk open-heart operations to replace valves that they have outgrown. Here, we demonstrate a biomimetic prosthetic valve that is geometrically adaptable to accommodate somatic growth and structural asymmetries within the heart. Inspired by the human venous valve, whose geometry is optimized to preserve functionality across a wide range of constantly varying volume loads and diameters, our balloon-expandable synthetic bileaflet valve analog exhibits similar adaptability to dimensional and shape changes. Benchtop and acute in vivo experiments validated design functionality, and in vivo survival studies in growing sheep demonstrated that mechanical valve expansion accommodated growth. As illustrated in this work, dynamic size adaptability with preservation of unidirectional flow in prosthetic valves thus offers a paradigm shift in the treatment of heart valve disease.  "
Cardiac valvular abnormalities associated with use and cumulative exposure of cabergoline for hyperprolactinemia: the CATCH study.  ;"BACKGROUND: Whether lower dose cabergoline therapy for hyperprolactinemia increases risk of valvular dysfunction remains controversial. We examined valvular abnormalities among asymptomatic adults with hyperprolactinemia treated with dopamine agonists. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted among adults receiving cabergoline or bromocriptine for > 12 months for hyperprolactinemia and had no cardiac-related symptoms. Cardiac valve morphology and function were assessed from transthoracic echocardiograms at the study visit (except for two participants) with evaluation performed blinded to type and duration of dopamine agonist received. RESULTS: Among 174 participants (mean age 49 ± 13 years, 63% women) without known structural heart disease before starting therapy, 62 received only cabergoline, 63 received only bromocriptine, and 49 received both. Median cabergoline use was 2.8 years in cabergoline only users and 3.2 years for those exposed to both cabergoline and bromocriptine; median bromocriptine use was 5.5 years in bromocriptine only users and 1.1 years for those exposed to both cabergoline and bromocriptine. Compared with bromocriptine only users (17.5%), regurgitation of ≥1 valve was more common for cabergoline only (37.1%, P = 0.02) but not for combined exposure (26.5%, P = 0.26). Compared with bromocriptine only exposure (1.6%), regurgitation of ≥2 valves was more common for cabergoline only (11.3%, P = 0.03) and combined exposure (12.2%, P = 0.04). Cabergoline only users had higher age-sex-adjusted odds for ≥1 valve with grade 2+ regurgitation compared to bromocriptine only users (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 3.2, 95% confidence interval [CI]:1.3-7.5, P = 0.008), but the association for combined exposure to cabergoline and bromocriptine was not significant (aOR 1.7, 95%CI:0.7-4.3, P = 0.26). Compared to bromocriptine only, age-sex-adjusted odds of ≥2 valves with grade 2+ regurgitation were higher for both cabergoline only (aOR 8.4, 95% CI:1.0-72.2, P = 0.05) and combined exposure (aOR 8.8, 95% CI:1.0-75.8, P = 0.05). Cumulative cabergoline exposure > 115 mg was associated with a higher age-sex adjusted odds of ≥2 valves with grade 2+ regurgitation (aOR 9.6, 95%CI:1.1-81.3, P = 0.04) compared to bromocriptine only. CONCLUSIONS: Among community-based adults treated for hyperprolactinemia, cabergoline use and greater cumulative cabergoline exposure were associated with a higher prevalence of primarily mild valvular regurgitation compared with bromocriptine. Research is needed to clarify which patients treated with dopamine agonists may benefit from echocardiographic screening and surveillance.  "
Mucopolysaccharidosis type VI: case report with first neonatal presentation with ascites fetalis and rapidly progressive cardiac manifestation.  ;BACKGROUND: The Mucopolysaccharidosis type VI (MPS VI), also known as Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome (OMIM 253200) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal disorder, caused by the deficiency of the enzyme N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfatase (also known as arylsulfatase B) due to mutations of the ARSB gene. Cardiologic features are well recognized, and are always present in MPS VI patients. Generally, the onset and the progression of the cardiologic symptoms are insidious, and just a few patients have developed a rapidly progressive disease. Cardiac involvement in MPS VI is a common and progressive feature. For MPS patients, cardiac evaluations are recommended every 1 to 2 years, including blood pressure measurement, electrocardiography and echocardiography. However, congestive heart failure and valvular surgical repair are not frequently seen, and if so, they are performed in adults. Here we report on an atypical MPS VI case with ascites fetalis and a rapidly progressive cardiac disease. CASE PRESENTATION: A 6-month-old Brazilian male, only child of a Brazilian healthy non-consanguineous couple. During pregnancy, second trimester ultrasonography observed fetal ascites and bilateral hydrocele. Physical exam at 6 months-old revealed a typical gibbus deformity and MPS was suspected. Biochemical investigation revealed a diagnosis of MPS type VI, confirmed by molecular test. Baseline echocardiogram revealed discrete tricuspid regurgitation and a thickened mitral valve with posterior leaflet prolapse, causing moderate to severe regurgitation. The patient evolved with mitral insufficiency and congestive heart failure, eventually requiring surgical repair by the first year of age. CONCLUSIONS: We report the first case of MPS VI whose manifestations started in the prenatal period with fetal ascites, with severe cardiac valvular disease that eventually required early surgical repair. Moreover, in MPS with neonatal presentation, including fetal hydrops, besides MPS I, IVA and VII, clinicians should include MPS VI in the differential diagnosis.

New Evidence Supporting a Novel Conceptual Framework for Distinguishing Proportionate and Disproportionate Functional Mitral Regurgitation.  ;"IMPORTANCE: Traditionally, physicians distinguished between mitral regurgitation (MR) as a determinant of outcomes and MR as a biomarker of left-ventricular (LV) dysfunction by designating the lesions as primary or secondary, respectively. In primary MR, leaflet abnormalities cause the MR, resulting in modest increases in LV end-diastolic volume over time, whereas in patients with classic secondary MR, LV dysfunction and dilatation lead to MR without structural leaflet abnormalities. However, certain patients with global LV disease (eg, those with left bundle branch block or regional wall motion abnormalities) have the features of primary MR and might respond favorably to interventions that aim to restore the proper functioning of the mitral valve apparatus. OBSERVATIONS: A novel conceptual framework is proposed, which classifies patients with meaningful LV disease based on whether the severity of MR is proportionate or disproportionate to the LV end-diastolic volume. Treatments that reduce LV volumes (eg, neurohormonal antagonists) are effective in proportionate MR but not disproportionate MR. Conversely, procedures that restore mitral valve function (eg, cardiac resynchronization and mitral valve repair) are effective in patients with disproportionate MR but not in those with proportionate MR. The proposed framework explains the discordant findings in the Multicentre Randomized Study of Percutaneous Mitral Valve Repair MitraClip Device in Patients With Severe Secondary Mitral Regurgitation (MITRA-FR) and the Cardiovascular Outcomes Assessment of the MitraClip Percutaneous Therapy for Heart Failure Patients with Functional Mitral Regurgitation (COAPT) trials; differences in procedural success and medical therapy in the 2 studies cannot explain the different results. In addition, the small group of patients in the COAPT trial who had the features of proportionate MR and were similar to those enrolled in the MITRA-FR trial did not respond favorably to transcatheter mitral valve repair. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The characterization of patients with functional MR into proportionate and disproportionate subtypes may explain the diverse range of responses to drug and device interventions that have been observed.

Utility of the long DrySeal sheath in facilitating transcatheter pulmonary valve implantation with the Edwards Sapien 3 valve.  ;"OBJECTIVE: To assess the utility of the 65-cm-long Gore DrySeal sheath when compared to the standard 36-cm-long Edwards expandable sheath (e-sheath) for transcatheter pulmonary valve implantation (TPVI) with the Edwards Sapien 3 valve. METHODS: All patients who underwent TPVI with the Sapien 3 valve, excluding those performed via hybrid approach, at our center between September 2015 and November 2019 were retrospectively reviewed and compared between two groups. RESULTS: A total of 94 patients were enrolled; 29 patients underwent TPVI with the Sapien valve using the DrySeal sheath and 65 underwent TPVI using the e-sheath. The height and body weight of patients implanted using the DrySeal sheath ranged from 137 to 193 cm and from 33 to 129 kg, respectively. Valve delivery time was significantly shorter in the DrySeal group (median time 4 min 33 s vs. 9 min 6 s, p = .002). There were no complications in the DrySeal group (0/27). Nine procedural complications occurred in the e-sheath group (9/65), five of which were potentially directly related to sheath choice, including tricuspid valve injury in four and embolization of the tip of the e-sheath during retrieval of a ruptured balloon in one patient. CONCLUSIONS: TPVI with the Sapien 3 valve using the 65-cm-long DrySeal sheath facilitates faster and safer valve implantation when compared to the e-sheath.  "
Percutaneous edge-to-edge repair for common atrioventricular valve regurgitation in a patient with heterotaxy syndrome, single ventricle physiology, and unbalanced atrioventricular septal defect.  ;Congenital heart disease patients, specifically with unbalanced atrioventricular septal defects and common atrioventricular valves requiring single ventricle palliation, have substantial morbidity and mortality. Atrioventricular valve regurgitation (AVVR) is associated with poor outcomes in single ventricle patients, and many of them require surgical treatment of AVVR in their lifetimes. We describe a unique case of transcatheter edge-to-edge valve repair using the MitraClip system (Abbott, Chicago, IL) in a single ventricle patient with severe common AVVR.  
Association of tethering of the second-order chords and prolapse of the first-order chords of the anterior leaflet: A risk factor for early and late repair failure.  ;BACKGROUND AND AIM: Second-order chord tethering of the anterior leaflet is a risk factor for failure of posterior leaflet prolapse repair. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We describe two cases of second-order chord tethering of the anterior leaflet associated with severe mitral regurgitation due to prolapse or chordal rupture of the anterior leaflet, causing early and late failure of repair. RESULTS: We described two cases where this phenomenon happened. CONCLUSIONS: Our cases demonstrate that the second-order chords of the prolapsing AL can be tethered and that this aspect should be carefully evaluated before surgery, as it can progress over time, affecting the results of surgical repair.  
Preprocedural Imaging Evaluation of Pulmonary Valve Replacement After Repair of Tetralogy of Fallot: What the Radiologist Needs to Know.  ;Tetrallogy of Fallot (TOF) is the most frequent form of cyanotic congenital heart disease. Despite advances in surgical and medical treatment, mortality remains high. Residual dysfunction of the pulmonary valve (PV) after correction of right ventricular outflow tract obstruction is an important cause of morbidity, leading to irreversible right ventricular dysfunction, arrhythmias, heart failure and occasionally, death. The strategies for PVR have evolved over the last decades, and the timing of the intervention remains the foundation of the decision-making process. Symptoms of heart failure are unreliable indicators for optimal timing of repair. Imaging plays an essential role in the assessment of PV integrity and dysfunction. The identification of the best timing for PVR requires a multimodality approach. Transthoracic echocardiography is the most commonly used imaging modality for the initial assessment and follow-up of TOF patients, although its utility has technical limitations, especially in adults. Cardiac computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are now routinely used for preoperative and postoperative evaluation of these patients, and provide highly valuable information about the anatomy and pathophysiology. Imaging evidence of disease progression is now part of the major guidelines to define the best timing for reintervention. The purpose of this article is to review the pathophysiology after TOF repair, identify the main imaging anatomic and physiologic features, describe the indications for PVR and recognize the role of imaging in the assessment of these patients to define the appropriate timing of PVR.

Outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve implantations in high-volume or low-volume centres in Germany.  ;OBJECTIVE: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is the most common aortic valve replacement in Germany. Since 2015, to ensure high-quality procedures, hospitals in Germany and other countries that meet the minimum requirement of 50 interventions per centre are being certified to perform TAVI. This study analyses the impact of these requirements on case number and in-hospital outcomes. METHODS: All isolated TAVI procedures and in-hospital outcomes between 2008 and 2016 were identified by International Classification of Diseases (ICD) and the German Operation and Procedure Classification codes. RESULTS: 73 467 isolated transfemoral and transapical TAVI procedures were performed in Germany between 2008 and 2016. During this period, the number of TAVI procedures per year rose steeply, whereas the overall rates of hospital mortality and complications declined. In 2008, the majority of procedures were performed in hospitals with fewer than 50 cases per year (54.63%). Until 2014, the share of patients treated in low-volume centres constantly decreased to 5.35%. After the revision of recommendations, it further declined to 1.99%. In the 2 years after the introduction of the minimum requirements on case numbers, patients were at decreased risk for in-hospital mortality when treated in a high-volume centre (risk-adjusted OR 0.62, p=0.012). The risk for other in-hospital outcomes (stroke, permanent pacemaker implantation and bleeding events) did not differ after risk adjustment (p=0.346, p=0.142 and p=0.633). CONCLUSION: A minimum volume of 50 procedures per centre and year appears suitable to allow for sufficient routine and thus better in-hospital outcomes, while ensuring nationwide coverage of TAVI procedures.  
Infective endocarditis in French Polynesia: Epidemiology, treatments and outcomes.  ;"BACKGROUND: French Polynesia is a French overseas collectivity in the South Pacific Ocean, where data on infective endocarditis (IE) are lacking. AIMS: To investigate the epidemiology and outcomes of IE in French Polynesia. METHODS: All hospital records from consecutive patients hospitalized in Taaone Hospital, Tahiti, from 2015 to 2018, with an International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision, separation diagnosis of IE (I330), were reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS: From 190 hospital charts reviewed, 105 patients with a final diagnosis of IE, confirmed according to the modified Duke criteria, were included. The median duration of follow-up was 71 days (interquartile range 18-163 days). The mean age was 55±17 years, and there were 68 men (65%). Thirty-five patients (33%) had a history of rheumatic carditis and 43 (41%) had a prosthetic valve. There were 40 (38%) cases of staphylococcal IE, 32 (30%) of streptococcal IE and six (6%) of enterococcal IE. Cardiogenic shock, septic shock and clinically relevant cerebral complications were strongly associated with death from any cause (hazard ratio [HR] 16.85, 95% confidence interval [CI] 5.45-52.05 [P<0.001]; HR 2.62, 95% CI 1.23-5.56 [P=0.01]; and HR 4.14, 95% CI 1.92-8.92 [P<0.001], respectively). Seventy-three patients (69%) had a theoretical indication for surgery, which was performed in 38 patients (36%). Lack of surgery when there was a theoretical indication was significantly associated with death (HR 6.93, 95% CI 3.47-13.83; P<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The pattern of IE in French Polynesia differs from Western countries in many ways. Postrheumatic valvular disease remains the main underlying disease, and access to emergency heart surgery is still a challenge.  "

Early exercise training feasibility after aortic valve repair: A multicentre prospective French survey on behalf of the Aortic Valve repair International Registry (AVIATOR).  ;"BACKGROUND: Standardization of aortic valve repair by the external ring annuloplasty approach is an alternative to valve replacement to avoid prosthetic valve-related events. Although the benefit of exercise training to improve postoperative exercise tolerance has been demonstrated in many conditions after cardiac surgery, it has never been described after aortic valve repair. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the feasibility of an early exercise training programme after aortic valve repair. METHODS: Consecutive patients were prospectively included in 13 postoperative centres. Patients underwent an exercise training programme for approximately 3-5 weeks. Transthoracic echocardiography and a cardiopulmonary exercise test were performed before and after the exercise training programme. RESULTS: Fifty patients (mean±standard deviation [SD] age: 50±13 years) were included a mean of 13.6±12.0 days after aortic valve repair. The preoperative degree of aortic insufficiency was moderate to severe in 35 patients (70%) and the aortic valve was bicuspid in 24 patients (48%). Valve-sparing root replacement and isolated aortic valve repair (including 10% supracoronary aorta replacement) were performed in 64% and 36% of patients, respectively. We found no aortic insufficiency occurrence or worsening and no adverse clinical events after the exercise training programme. Mean left ventricular ejection fraction increased significantly (from 54%±8% to 57%±9%; P=0.0007). Mean peak oxygen consumption and first ventilatory threshold increased from 17.0±5.3 to 22.5±7.8mL/kg/min (32% increase) and from 12.0±3.9 to 14.3±5.2mL/kg/min (19% increase), respectively (both P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Exercise training early after aortic valve repair is safe and seems to significantly improve exercise capacity.  "
Clinical significance of electrocardiographic markers of myocardial damage prior to aortic valve replacement.  ;"BACKGROUND: Pre-operative myocardial fibrosis and remodeling impact on outcomes after aortic valve replacement (AVR). We aimed at investigating the prognostic impact of preoperative electrocardiographic (ECG) markers of left ventricular (LV) myocardial damage, i.e. bundle branch block (BBB) and ECG strain pattern after (surgical or transcatheter) AVR for severe aortic stenosis (AS). METHODS: Between April 2008 and October 2017, we explored consecutive patients referred to our Heart Valve Clinic for first AVR for severe AS. Detailed pre-operative phenotyping and ECG analysis were performed. Patients were followed-up after AVR for major cardiac events (ME), i.e. cardiovascular death, cardiac hospitalization for acute heart failure and stroke. RESULTS: BBB and ECG strain were respectively observed in 13.5 and 21% of the 1122 patients included. These ECG markers identified a subgroup of older patients, with higher NYHA class and more advanced myocardial disease as detected by echocardiography, i.e. higher LV mass and lower LV ejection fraction, global longitudinal strain and integrated backscatter, than patients without ECG strain or BBB. ME occurred in 212 (18.6%) patients during a mean follow-up of 4.4 ± 1.5 years with higher incidence in case of ECG strain or BBB (HR 1.56, 95%CI 1.13-2.14, p = 0.006; HR 1.47, 95%CI 1.02-2.13, p = 0.04 respectively). The prognostic value of ECG strain remained significant after adjustment for age, diabetes and pre-operative LVEF. CONCLUSIONS: Pre-operative ECG markers of myocardial damage identify a subgroup of AS patients at high risk of post-AVR cardiovascular complications irrespective of other prognostic factors and should help the multiparametric staging of cardiac damage to guide AVR.

Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion for Patients with Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement, MitraClip, Percutaneous Coronary Intervention, and Ablation for Atrial Fibrillation: Optimizing Long-Term Patient Outcomes.  ;Interventional cardiologists and electrophysiologists perform various procedures to improve the quality and longevity of life. The mitigation of stroke risk in patients with atrial fibrillation may be ignored when considering other more acute or urgent situations, such as severe coronary or valvular heart disease requiring treatment or symptomatic atrial fibrillation necessitating ablation. However, we must keep this long-term stroke risk in mind to optimize patients' overall outcomes. Percutaneous left atrial appendage occlusion is an important option in those who present with high stroke and bleeding risk. Ongoing studies will help provide objective data in this arena.  
3D Printing Applications for Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.  ;PURPOSE OF REVIEW: A combination of evolving 3D printing technologies, new 3D printable materials, and multi-disciplinary collaborations have made 3D printing applications for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) a promising tool to promote innovation, increase procedural success, and provide a compelling educational tool. This review synthesizes the knowledge via publications and our group's experience in this area that exemplify uses of 3D printing for TAVR. RECENT FINDINGS: Patient-specific 3D-printed models have been used for TAVR pre-procedural device sizing, benchtop prediction of procedural complications, planning for valve-in-valve and bicuspid aortic valve procedures, and more. Recent publications also demonstrate how 3D printing can be used to test assumptions about why certain complications occur during THV implantation. Finally, new materials and combinations of existing materials are starting to bridge the large divide between current 3D material and cardiac tissue properties. Several studies have demonstrated the utility of 3D printing in understanding challenges of TAVR. Innovative approaches to benchtop testing and multi-material printing have brought us closer to being able to predict how a THV will interact with a specific patient's aortic anatomy. This work to date is likely to open the door for advancements in other areas of structural heart disease, such as interventions involving the mitral valve, tricuspid valve, and left atrial appendage.  
Left ventricular filling pressure and survival following aortic valve replacement for severe aortic stenosis.  ;OBJECTIVE: To determine whether echocardiography-derived left ventricular filling pressure influences survival in patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) undergoing aortic valve replacement (AVR). METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 1383 consecutive patients with severe AS, normal ejection fraction and interpretable filling pressure undergoing AVR. Left ventricular filling pressure was determined according to current guidelines using mitral inflow, mitral annular tissue Doppler, estimated right ventricular systolic pressure and left atrial volume index. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to assess the influence of various parameters on mortality. RESULTS: Age was 75±10 years and 552 (40%) were female. Left ventricular filling pressure was normal in 325 (23%), indeterminate in 463 (33%) and increased in 595 (43%). Mean follow-up was 7.3±3.7 years, and mortality was 1.2%, 4.2% and 18.9% at 30 days and 1 and 5 years, respectively. Compared with patients with normal filling pressure, patients with increased filling pressure were older (78±9 vs 70±12, p<0.001), more often female (45% vs 35%, p=0.002) and were more likely to have New York Heart Association class III-IV symptoms (35% vs 24%, p=0.004), coronary artery disease (55% vs 42%, p<0.001) and concentric left ventricular hypertrophy (63% vs 37%, p<0.001). After correction for other factors, increased left ventricular filling pressure remained an independent predictor of mortality after successful AVR (adjusted HR 1.45 (95% CI 1.16 to 1.81), p=0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative increased left ventricular filling pressure is common in patients with AS undergoing AVR and has important prognostic implications, regardless of symptom status. Future prospective studies should consider whether patients with increased filling pressure would benefit from earlier operation.  
Sex differences in aortic stenosis: from pathophysiology to treatment.  ;Introduction: In aortic stenosis (AS), there are clear sex differences in clinical presentation, left ventricular (LV) response to pressure overload, and pathophysiology of valvular calcification. These differences may affect outcome following valve intervention.Area covered: This review aims to discuss sex differences in clinical presentation, pathophysiology of aortic valve calcification, LV remodeling in view of historic and recent echocardiographic and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging studies, and outcome after valve intervention. In addition, it will also provide some brief insights on the exercise physiology in women and men with AS.Expert commentary: Women at presentation are often older, have higher prevalence of hypertension and diastolic dysfunction, while men are younger, and more often have a bicuspid aortic valve and higher atherosclerotic disease burden. Men have more valve calcification than women for a given severity of AS and develop different patterns of LV remodeling and myocardial fibrosis. Although women tend to walk shorter on treadmill and achieve lower metabolic equivalents, they achieve similar peak heart rates and blood pressure, and the frequency of revealed symptoms during exercise test is comparable in both sexes. Men are more likely to undergo a surgical AVR with better outcome, while women have generally better outcome after TAVI.  
State of the Art Imaging Review of Blunt and Penetrating Cardiac Trauma.  ;Traumatic cardiovascular injuries are only second to the central nervous system injuries as a cause of death in young adult population. Multidetector computed tomography is the gold standard diagnostic modality in patients with blunt or penetrating chest trauma and clinical suspicion of cardiac injury. The imaging spectrum of cardiac injuries includes but not limits to pericardial rupture, myocardial contusions, valve rupture, coronary artery injuries, cardiac herniations, and cardiac tamponade. In this review article, we discuss clinical presentation, types, and mechanism of cardiac trauma with emphasis on the imaging findings and illustrations in blunt, penetrating traumatic, and iatrogenic cardiac injuries.  
Medical decision making for 5D cardiac model: Template matching technique and simulation of the fifth dimension.  ;The purpose of this paper is to develop a 5D cardiac model which is inspired from the 5D model for the lungs. This model depends on five variables: the anatomical structure of the 3D heart, temporal dimension and the function of blood flow as the fifth dimension. To test this hypothesis, we took the same mathematical modeling as a reference for the fifth dimension of pulmonary flow where r→ρ(t)=r→v(t)+rf→(t) wherer→v(t) is the displacement vectors with approximate magnitudes by linear functions of the tidal volume and rf→(t) is the blood flow. The scans were acquired for 10 patients,in the 404 series for a total of 18,483 images studied in three cases: healthy patient, case of heart failure and aortic stenosis. Where r→vand r→f are the unit vectors along the volume of ejection and the blood flow axes, indicating the direction of motion of the object due to heart volume ejection and blood flow variations, respectively. The quantities of α and β coefficients are determined from real-time patient image data. The alpha and beta coefficients are derived from the following dimension equations[mm / ml] [mm*ms / ml] . Since the cardiac system has two diastolic and systolic phases, we have calculated α1 and β1 for telediatolic volume and α2 and β2 for telesystolic volume throughout the cardiac cycle as a function of the location of the cuts chosen randomly. Fifth-dimensional experiments are used to track, simulate the behavior of blood flow to detect preliminary indications for the identification of stenosis or valve leakage. The average discrepancy was tabulated as the global fraction of systolic ejection. The results shown in Fig. 3 detect a correspondence between the hunting chamber cut and the flow sequence through the orifice of aorta for this patient with suspicious of having an aortic stenosis disease and an ejection fraction about 71% with a maximum of velocity (Vmax) detected=250 (cm / ms) = 2.5 (m / 10-3 s). In this case this patient has a minor stenosis in the aorta. It should be referred that the normalization of this measures is classified such as : Minor stenosis: area 1.5 cm2, Vmax <3 m / moderate stenosis: area 1.0 - 1.5 cm2, Vmax 3 - 4 m / severe stenosis: area <1.0 cm2, Vmax> 4 m / s. For a patient who has an aortic stenosis the cloud of the points is accumulated comparing to the origin of the axis while the patient with a symptom of insufficiency the points are widened with a remarkable gap in the trajectory. To solve the issue of the bad prediction, the inaccuracy of the clouds points of the model 5D, the lack of the exact measurements to estimate the degree of cardiac insufficiency (leakage or stenosis), a solution of 5D imagery was depicted. Our main contribution is to test the validity of the template-matching algorithm and the fifth dimension simulation to provide more clues to detect the aortic stenosis and cardiac insufficiency in the context of medical decision support.  
First-in-human report of MitraClip G4 implantation for severe degenerative mitral regurgitation.  ;The new MitraClip G4 device (Abbott Vascular) has been recently approved by Food and Drug Administration and is currently in limited release. A patient with a large mitral regurgitation (MR) jet but a relatively small mitral valve area (MVA) was not a surgical repair candidate nor an optimal MitraClip third-generation device candidate. Therefore, we implanted the new G4 NTW device that resulted in significant MR reduction with a 57% reduction in MVA. To our knowledge, this is the first reported clinical use of the MitraClip G4 NTW device. We find that it may provide better results than a single NTR device and less reduction in MVA than two older generation devices. Further experience is needed to optimize patient selection for the four new G4 devices available.  
All-cause mortality, stroke, and bleeding in patients with atrial fibrillation and valvular heart disease.  ;"AIMS: To compare the risk of all-cause mortality, stroke and bleeding in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and valvular heart disease (VHD) treated with vitamin K antagonist (VKA) or factor Xa-inhibitors (FXa-I; rivaroxaban and apixaban). METHODS AND RESULTS: We crosslinked data from Danish nationwide registries identifying patients with AF and VHD (VHD; aortic stenosis/insufficiency, mitral insufficiency, bioprosthetic heart valves, mitral-, and aortic valve repair) initiating VKA or FXa-I between January 2014 and June 2017. Outcomes were all-cause mortality, stroke, and bleeding. Using cause-specific Cox regression, we reported the standardized absolute 2-year risk of the outcomes and absolute risk differences (ARD).We identified 1,115 (41.7%), 620 (23.1%), and 942 (35.2%) patients initiating treatment with VKA, rivaroxaban, and apixaban. The standardized absolute risk (95% CI) of all-cause mortality associated with VKA treatment was 34.1% (30.4% to 37.8%) with corresponding ARD for FXa-I of -2.7% (-6.7% to 1.4%). The standardized absolute risk of stroke for VKA was 3.8% (2.2% to 5.4%) with corresponding ARD for FXa-I of -0.1% (-2.0% to 1.8%). The standardized risk of bleeding for VKA was 10.4% (7.2% to 12.9%) with corresponding ARD for FXa-I of -2.0% (-5.1% to 1.1%). The risk of bleeding was significantly reduced in subgroup analyses of apixaban compared with VKA (ARD: -3.9% (-7.0% to -0.9%)) and rivaroxaban (ARD: -5.6% (-9.5% to -1.7%)). CONCLUSION: In this nationwide cohort study, there were no significant differences in the risks of all-cause mortality, stroke, and bleeding in patients with AF and VHD treated with VKA compared with FXa-I.

Right Ventricular Growth and Function After Balloon Valvuloplasty for Critical Pulmonary Valve Stenosis in Infants and Neonates.  ;Little data are published about right ventricular (RV) growth and function in infants and neonates after balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty (BPV) for critical valvular pulmonary stenosis (PS). We aimed to assess the RV growth and function during 1 year after BPV for critical valvular PS in neonates and infants. A total of 41 infants and neonates with isolated critical valvular PS who underwent BPV from August 2016 to Sep 2018 were enrolled in the study. Complete Echocardiographic examination was performed to all infants before, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year after BPV. The RV systolic pressure and transvalvular pulmonary pressure gradient significantly decreased 1 week after BPV and continue to decrease more slowly during the period of follow-up. During follow-up, RV end-diastolic dimension increased significantly, whereas RV anterior wall thickness significantly decreased. The mean diameters of pulmonary valve annulus and tricuspid valve annulus significantly increased after BPV over the period of follow-up. RV systolic and diastolic dysfunction improved significantly as reported by reduced RV Tei index and tricuspid annular systolic velocity and increased RV E/A ratio. RV growth and function were significantly improved after BPV for critical PS in infants and neonates and catch-up growth of right ventricular structures occurred after 6 months of BPV.  
Sequential Percutaneous Approach for Severe Mitral and Aortic Regurgitation.  ;Percutaneous approach for valvular heart disease is accepted as a safe and feasible strategy to treat patients considered at high surgical risk with aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation. Additionally, the growing experience led to the increasing use of transcatheter aortic valve implantation in several indications, such as in pure aortic regurgitation. The authors present the case of a 72-year-old woman with prohibitive surgical risk due to several comorbidities, including a chronic arterial dissection from the right carotid artery to the femoral arteries bilaterally that presented with signs and symptoms of heart failure, having a transthoracic echocardiography that showed severe functional mitral and aortic regurgitation. Combined percutaneous intervention for multivalvular disease in this clinical scenario is challenging, and the reported experience is still scarce and limited to inoperable patients.

Multimodality Imaging in Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy for Risk Stratification.  ;In hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, multimodality imaging is crucial to confirm diagnosis, assess for presence and mechanism of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, and risk stratification for sudden cardiac death. This review will focus on the application of imaging to assess established and emerging factors to be considered in sudden cardiac death risk stratification.  
CD4(+) T cells and TGFβ1/MAPK signal pathway involved in the valvular hyperblastosis and fibrosis in patients with rheumatic heart disease.  ;The aim of this study was to investigate the roles of CD4+ T cells and transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ1) in the pathological process of valvular hyperblastosis and fibrosis of patients with rheumatic heart disease (RHD). A total of 151 patients were enrolled, among whom, 78 patients were with RHD, and 73 were age and gender matched RHD negative patients. Blood samples and valve specimens were collected for analysis. Pathological changes and collagen fibers contents of valves were analyzed using HE and Masson staining. Percentage of peripheral blood CD4+ T cells was tested through flow cytometry. TGFβ1 level in serum were identified by ELISA. CD4+ T cells infiltration and expression of TGFβ1, p-p38, p-JNK, p-ERK in valves were detected by immunohistochemistry. The mRNA and protein levels of p38, JNK, ERK, TGFβ1, I-collagen and α-SMA were detected by qRT-PCR and western blotting, respectively. The heart valve tissues of RHD patients showed higher degrees of fibrosis, calcification and lymphocytes infiltration, which were mainly CD4+ T cells. In addition, compared with control group, RHD patients had more total CD4+ T cells in peripheral blood and valve tissues. Expression of TGFβ1, phosphorylation of JNK and p38, and synthesis of I-collagen in valve tissues of RHD patients were also significantly increased. Furthermore, we found a strong positive correlation between TGFβ1 expression and phosphorylation of JNK and p38. CD4+ T cells, and fibrogenic cytokine TGFβ1, which activate the intracellular MAPK signaling pathway may participate in the fibrosis of heart valve in RHD patients.

Tropheryma whipplei endocarditis: An uncommon infection with potentially fatal consequences.  ;We report a case of culture-negative aortic valve endocarditis secondary to Tropheryma whipplei infection. Our patient underwent aortic valve replacement after 4 weeks of antibiotic therapy with persistently negative blood culture results. Despite a technically uneventful operation, the patient showed continued sepsis and was unresponsive to a broad-spectrum of antibiotic therapy with subsequent multiorgan failure. He died on the 5th postoperative day, and diagnosis was established at postmortem examination. In this case report, we discuss the diagnosis and treatment of a rare type of endocarditis caused by T. whipplei.

Masters Athlete Screening Study (MASS): Insights Into the Psychological Impact of Cardiovascular Preparticipation Screening.  ;"OBJECTIVE: To determine the psychological impact of a cardiovascular disease (CVD) diagnosis identified during preparticipation screening (PPS) of masters athletes. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Masters athletes diagnosed with CVD through the Masters Athletes Screening Study. PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-seven athletes (89.6% male, mean age at diagnosis 60.1 ± 7.1 years, range 40-76) with diagnoses of coronary artery disease (CAD) (73.1%), high premature ventricular contraction burden (9.0%), mitral valve prolapse (7.5%), atrial fibrillation (AF) (3.0%), bicuspid aortic valve (3.0%), aortic dilatation (1.5%), coronary anomaly (1.5%), and rheumatic heart disease (1.5%). Three participants had multiple diagnoses. INTERVENTION: Online survey distributed to masters athletes identified with CVD. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Assessment of psychological distress [Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R)], perceptions of screening, and preferred support by CVD type. RESULTS: The median total IES-R and subscale scores were within the normal range {median [interquartile range (IQR)] total 2.0 [0-6.0]; intrusion 1.0 [0-3.0]; avoidance 0 [0-3.0]; hyperarousal 0 [0-1.0]}. Athletes with bicuspid aortic valve [20.5 (IQR, 4.0-37.0)], AF [7.0 (IQR, 0-14.0)], and severe CAD [5.5 (IQR, 1.0-12.0)] had the highest total IES-R scores. One individual with bicuspid aortic valve reported a significant stress reaction. Ten athletes (14.9%) had scores >12. Ninety-three percent of athletes were satisfied having undergone PPS. Preferred type of support varied by cardiovascular diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of masters athletes diagnosed with CVD through PPS do not experience significant levels of psychological distress. Athletes diagnosed with more severe types of CVD should be monitored for psychological distress. Support should be provided through a multidisciplinary and individualized approach.  "
Transapical and Transfemoral Combined Mitral Valve Repair With Annular and Leaflet Therapies.  ;Two high-risk patients were successfully treated with concomitant implantation of a transapical off-pump beating heart semirigid D-shape annuloplasty device combined in 1 case with a transfemoral edge-to-edge device and in another with transapical chordal implantation. The significant anteroposterior diameter reduction offered by the annuloplasty implantation maximized the leaflet coaptation obtained by the prolapse correction performed with the leaflet devices. Combining the transcatheter annuloplasty device and leaflet/chordal repair technologies represents progress toward definitive transcatheter treatment of degenerative mitral valve disease.  
The difficult balance between thrombosis and bleeding after transcatheter aortic valve replacement: A translational review.  ;Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has emerged as the treatment of choice for patients with severe aortic stenosis deemed at high or intermediate risk for cardiac surgery. In light of the latest literature advances, TAVR will undoubtedly concern a growing number of patients because of the progressive extension of its indications. Whereas significant efforts have been made to reduce the burden of periprocedural complications, TAVR still exposes patients to a sizeable number of adverse outcomes, including thrombotic and bleeding events. Although contradictory, these two phenomena are closely related to pathophysiological processes inherent to flow disturbances induced by aortic stenosis itself, but also to a complex interaction between bioprosthetic valves and native tissues in frail patients clustering various co-morbidities. Reinforcing this paradigm, multiple TAVR studies have emphasized the view that both thrombosis and bleeding events have a deleterious effect on patient outcomes. Therefore, we sought to perform a comprehensive translational review of the current literature addressing the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to thrombosis and bleeding after TAVR, and underline innovative strategies aimed at reducing these complications.  
Primary cardiac hospitalizations in pulmonary arterial hypertension: Trends and outcomes from 2001 to 2014.  ;"BACKGROUND: Hospitalizations in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) are common and are often for cardiac conditions. Using the National (Nationwide) Inpatient Sample (NIS), we examined characteristics and mortality of primary cardiac hospitalizations in PAH from 2001 to 2014. METHODS: Adult hospitalizations with any diagnosis code for PAH were identified. Primary cardiac disease was defined as a primary discharge diagnosis of congestive heart failure (CHF), pulmonary heart disease, coronary atherosclerosis, acute myocardial infarction, dysrhythmia, conduction disorder, cardiomyopathy or carditis, heart valve disorder, or cardiac arrest. Temporal trends, characteristics, and in-hospital mortality were analyzed. RESULTS: From 2001 to 2014, there were 207,095 hospitalizations in PAH, of which 100,509 (48.5%) carried a primary cardiac diagnosis. Most primary cardiac hospitalizations in PAH were for CHF, and pneumonia was the most common primary non-cardiac diagnosis. Over the study period, primary cardiac hospitalizations in PAH fell from 52.9% to 41.4% (p < 0.001). CHF was the most frequent primary cardiac diagnosis associated with death, with sepsis representing the most common primary non-cardiac disease (1,226; 25.0%). Overall, the mortality in primary cardiac hospitalizations in PAH was 5.3% (vs. in primary non-cardiac, 6.9%, p < 0.001). On multivariable analysis, a primary cardiac discharge diagnosis remained associated with a decreased risk of death (odds ratio 0.85, p = 0.010). CONCLUSION: Primary cardiac hospitalizations in PAH are common and are associated with decreased mortality compared to admissions for primary non-cardiac diagnoses.  "
Septal flash is a prevalent and early dyssynchrony marker in transcatheter aortic valve replacement-induced left bundle branch block.  ;"New-onset left bundle branch block (LBBB) is a frequent complication after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and provides an opportunity to study dyssynchrony immediately following acute LBBB. This study aims to (1) assess echocardiographic dyssynchrony in acute TAVR-induced LBBB (TAVR-LBBB), and (2) compare dyssynchrony parameters among different patient groups with LBBB. The study enrolled all TAVR-LBBB patients at Ghent University Hospital between 2013 and 2019. First, acute TAVR-LBBB dyssynchrony was assessed by: (1) septal flash (SF); (2) interventricular mechanical delay (IVMD; cut-off ≥ 40 ms) and (3) presence of 'classical dyssynchronous strain pattern' assessed with speckle tracking. Secondly, acute TAVR-LBBB patients with SF (LBBBTAVR+SF) were compared to randomly selected LBBB-SF patients with preserved (LBBBSF+PEF) ànd reduced ejection fraction (LBBBSF+REF). In TAVR-LBBB patients (n = 25), SF was detected in 72% of patients, whereas only 5% of TAVR-LBBB patients showed a classical dyssynchronous strain pattern. IVMD in these TAVR-LBBB patients was 39 ms. In 90% of LBBBTAVR+SF patients, SF was observed within 24 h after LBBB onset. Among LBBB-SF patients, a classical strain pattern was more prevalent in LBBBSF+REF patients compared to LBBBTAVR+SF patients (80% vs. 7%; p < 0.001). IVMD was significantly longer in LBBBSF+PEF patients (52 ms; p = 0.002) and LBBBSF+REF patients (57 ms; p = 0.009) compared to LBBBTAVR+SF patients (37 ms). SF is an early and prevalent marker of LV dyssynchrony in acute TAVR-LBBB, whereas strain-based measures and IVMD do not appear to capture dyssynchrony at this early stage. Our findings from the comparative analysis generate the hypothesis that progressive LBBB-induced LV remodeling may be required for a 'classical dyssynchrony strain pattern' or significant IVMD to occur in TAVR-LBBB patients.

Secondary mitral regurgitation: pathophysiology, proportionality and prognosis.  ;Secondary mitral regurgitation (SMR) occurs as a result of multifactorial left atrioventricular dysfunction and maleficent remodelling. It is the most common and undertreated form of mitral regurgitation (MR) and is associated with a very poor prognosis. Whether SMR is a bystander reflecting the severity of the cardiomyopathy disease process has long been the subject of debate. Studies suggest that SMR is an independent driver of prognosis in patients with an intermediate heart failure (HF) phenotype and not those with advanced HF. There is also no universal agreement regarding the quantitative thresholds defining severe SMR and indeed there are challenges with echocardiographic quantification. Until recently, no surgical or transcatheter intervention for SMR had demonstrated prognostic benefit, in contrast with HF medical therapy and cardiac resynchronisation therapy. In 2018, the first two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of edge-to-edge transcatheter mitral valve repair versus guideline-directed medical therapy in HF (Percutaneous Repair with the MitraClip Device for Severe (MITRA-FR), Transcather mitral valve repair in patients with heart failure (COAPT)) reported contrasting yet complimentary results. Unlike in MITRA-FR, COAPT demonstrated significant prognostic benefit, largely attributed to the selection of patients with disproportionately severe MR relative to their HF phenotype. Consequently, quantifying the degree of SMR in relation to left ventricular volume may be a useful discriminator in predicting the success of transcatheter intervention. The challenge going forward is the identification and validation of such parameters while in parallel maintaining a heart-team guided holistic approach.  
High prevalence of physical inactivity after heart valve surgery and its association with long-term mortality: A nationwide cohort study.  ;AIMS: Physical activity (PA) and systematic efforts, such as cardiac rehabilitation, are recommended by several national guidelines for those who have received heart valve surgery. However, only a few studies have demonstrated real-world situations, such as changes in the PA level after heart valve surgery, and their effects on long-term outcomes. We designed this study to investigate the changes in PA after heart valve surgery and their associations with mortality using nationwide representative data. METHODS: This study was performed using the Korean National Health Insurance Service database. We included patients who received heart valve surgery from 2009 to 2015 and underwent regular health checkups before and after surgery. Subjects were grouped according to their PA level before and after the surgery. Information on all-cause mortality was obtained until 31 December 2016, with a maximum follow-up period of 5 years. RESULTS: Of the 6587 subjects, 3258 (49.5%) were physically inactive after surgery. Among patients who were physically active (n = 3070), 1196 (39.0%) became inactive after surgery. The postoperative 'inactive' group showed higher mortality than the 'active' group (hazard ratio (HR): 1.41, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.08-1.83). The 'inactive/inactive' group showed the highest risk of mortality (HR: 1.69, 95% CI: 1.19-2.40) compared with the 'active/active' group. CONCLUSIONS: Insufficient PA level after heart valve surgery is associated with higher risk of mortality. However, maintaining sufficient PA after heart valve surgery may be challenging for many patients. Therefore, systematic efforts, such as cardiac rehabilitation, should be considered in those who received heart valve surgery.  
Congenital heart disease in school children in Lagos, Nigeria: Prevalence and the diagnostic gap.  ;Congenital heart disease (CHD) in low-and-middle income countries (LMIC) is often characterized by late presentation resulting from inadequate screening and healthcare access in these regions. Accurate estimates of the burden of CHD among school children are often lacking. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence and distribution of CHD among school children in two communities (urban and semi-urban) in south western Nigeria. Using clinical assessment and portable echocardiography, 4107 school children aged 5 years to 16 years in Lagos, Nigeria, were selected using a multistage sampling procedure and screened for CHD. Diagnosis of CHD was made after echocardiography. Children identified with CHD were referred to a tertiary hospital for appropriate cardiac care. The 4,107 children screened had a mean age of 11.3 ± 2.7 years and 53.7% were females. Twenty seven children had echocardiography-confirmed CHD, representing a prevalence of CHD among school children in Lagos, Nigeria of 6.6 per 1000 children. Acyanotic CHD constituted 96.3% of detected cases. Two children diagnosed with CHD (Tetralogy of Fallot and severe pulmonary valve stenosis respectively) had successful intervention. The prevalence of previously undiagnosed CHD among school children in Lagos Nigeria is substantial and highlights gaps in the health care system and school health programs. Echocardiographic screening of school children provides an opportunity for missed early diagnosis and treatment of CHD and reduces the prevalence of first-diagnosed CHD in adulthood. Therefore, focused clinical examination of school children followed by echocardiography is a strategy that could bridge this diagnostic and treatment gap in CHD.  
[Grey zones on valvular heart disease: interventional cardiology versus cardiac surgery. Expert opinion].  ;Clinical guidelines, while representing an objective reference to perform correct therapeutic choices, contain grey zones, where recommendations are not supported by solid evidence. In a conference held in Bergamo in October 2018, an attempt was made to highlight some of the main grey zones in Cardiology and, through a comparison between experts, to draw shared conclusions that can illuminate our clinical practice. This manuscript contains the statements of the symposium concerning the controversies in the percutaneous treatment of valvulopathies. The first topic concerns the durability of aortic bioprostheses, comparing percutaneous interventional with surgical experiences. The second issue examines the opportunity to extend percutaneous aortic replacement as standard care to low-risk patients. The last gap in evidence concerns the percutaneous treatment of functional mitral valve insufficiency, with the MitraClip system. The work has also been implemented with evidences deriving from important randomized studies published after the date of the Conference.  
Correlation between Doppler echocardiography and right heart catheterization assessment of systolic pulmonary artery pressure in patients with severe aortic stenosis.  ;OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate reliability and accuracy of noninvasive measurement method by echocardiography compared to invasive measurement of systolic pulmonary artery pressure (SPAP) in a large cohort of aortic stenosis (AS) patients. BACKGROUND: Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is common in patients with cardiac disease, especially in left heart disease like severe AS. Invasive measurement by right heart catheterization (RHC) is the gold standard to assess pulmonary pressures. Nevertheless, echocardiography is widely used in everyday practice for estimation of pulmonary pressures and diagnosing PH. METHODS: A total of 1400 patients with AS and full invasive hemodynamic assessment by RHC and noninvasive measurements by Doppler echocardiography were included. RESULTS: Mean patient age was 81.5 ± 6.8 years, and 46.3% were males. SPAP was 44.7 ± 15.1 mm Hg by echocardiography and 45.3 ± 15.2 mm Hg by RHC. Pearson's correlation coefficient was r = .820 (P < .0001). Bland-Altman analysis showed a bias of -0.56 mm Hg (95% limits of agreement -18.38 to + 17.26 mm Hg) and 80.6% measurement accuracy. Pulmonary hypertension defined by RHC as a mean PAP ≥25 mm Hg was reliably diagnosed via an echocardiographically measured SPAP of >40 mm Hg (82.2% sensitivity, 80.2% specificity, 83.1% positive predictive value, 79.2% negative predictive value). CONCLUSIONS: In a large cohort of patients with severe aortic stenosis, we could demonstrate a very good correlation of SPAP between Doppler echocardiography and invasive RHC measurement. Pulmonary hypertension could be diagnosed by echocardiography with high sensitivity and specificity.  
Concomitant cardiac and hepatic hemangiomas.  ;Primary tumors of the heart are rare with a reported incidence of about 0.002% to 0.3% at autopsy. A cardiac hemangioma is a form of benign primary cardiac tumor that often presents with atypical clinical symptoms. Hemangiomas are generally isolated lesions. Here, we report a patient with previous hepatic hemangioma who later was found to have a large coexistent cardiac hemangioma presenting with cardiac compressive symptoms.

Causes and characteristics associated with early and late readmission after open-heart valve surgery.  ;"OBJECTIVES: The objectives of the study were to describe the causes of readmission from discharge to 30 days and from day 31 to 180 after discharge and to investigate the characteristics associated with overall and cause-specific readmissions after open-heart valve surgery. METHODS: A single-center, retrospective cohort of 980 patients undergoing open-heart valve surgery from 2013 to 2016. Time to the first readmission was analyzed using univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazard models. Results are reported as hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: In total, 366 patients (37%) experienced unplanned cardiac readmission within 180 days after discharge. Within 30 days after discharge, the most frequent causes of readmission were pericardial/pleural effusions (n = 87), infections (n = 50), and atrial fibrillation/flutter (n = 45). Accordingly, infections (n = 32) were the most common cause from day 31 to 180. No powerful predictors of overall cardiac readmission were identified, but several characteristics were associated with cause-specific readmissions: age ≤65 years (HR: 1.85; CI: 1.18-2.88), male gender (HR: 1.85; CI: 1.11-3.09), high alcohol intake (HR: 1.99; CI: 1.22-3.24) and mitral valve procedures (HR: 1.86; CI: 1.11-3.10) were associated with readmissions due to effusions. Ischemic heart disease with a prior percutaneous coronary intervention (HR: 2.94; CI: 1.53-5.63), mitral valve procedures (HR: 2.10; CI: 1.23-3.59), and postoperative atrial fibrillation/flutter (HR: 1.71; CI: 1.03-2.85) were associated with atrial fibrillation/flutter readmissions. CONCLUSION: Predicting overall readmissions after open-heart valve surgery is difficult as causes of readmissions vary and different causes are associated with different characteristics. Future studies should target reducing cause-specific readmissions.  "
Long-term outcomes of pulmonary valve replacement in patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot.  ;OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to evaluate long-term outcomes of pulmonary valve replacement (PVR) in patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) and to identify the factors associated with adverse clinical events (ACEs). METHODS: A total of 190 patients who underwent PVR between 1998 and 2015 after repair of TOF were retrospectively analysed. ACE was defined as all-cause death, heart transplantation or new-onset sustained arrhythmia. Univariable Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to identify the factors associated with ACE after PVR. RESULTS: The median age at PVR was 19 years. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed in 143 (75%) patients, and the median right ventricular (RV) end-diastolic and end-systolic volume index was 164 and 82 ml/m2, respectively. The follow-up completeness was 94%, and the median follow-up duration was 9.8 years. The transplantation-free survival and freedom from ACE at 15 years was 95% and 90%, respectively. The factors associated with ACE were older age at PVR, older age at TOF repair, New York Heart Association functional class III or IV, presence of tachyarrhythmias, longer cardiopulmonary bypass time and concomitant arrhythmia surgery. In a subgroup analysis of 143 patients with preoperative MRI data, larger RV end-systolic volume index, larger left ventricular end-systolic volume index and lower left ventricular ejection fraction were associated with ACE. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term outcomes of PVR in patients with repaired TOF were satisfactory. Proactive PVR before the onset of advanced symptoms, tachyarrhythmias and ventricular dysfunction may further improve the long-term survival of this patient population.  
Efficiency, Safety, and Quality of Life After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation Performed With Moderate Sedation Versus General Anesthesia.  ;"There is growing interest in ""minimalist"" transcatheter aortic valve implantation (M-TAVI), performed with conscious sedation instead of general anesthesia (GA-TAVI). We assessed the impact of M-TAVI on procedural efficiency, long-term safety, and quality of life (QoL) in 477 patients with severe aortic stenosis (82 years, women 50%, STS 5.0), who underwent M-TAVI (n = 278) or GA-TAVI (n = 199). M-TAVI patients were less likely to have NYHA Class ≥3, valve-in-valve TAVI, and receive self-expanding valves. M-TAVI was completed without conversion to GA in 269 (97%) patients. M-TAVI was more efficient that GA-TAVI including shorter lengths of stay (2 vs 3 days, p <0.0001), higher likelihood of being discharged home (87% vs 72%, p <0.0001), less use of blood transfusions (10% vs 22%, p = 0.0008), inotropes (13% vs 32%, p <0.0001), contrast volume (50 vs 90 ml, p <0.0001), fluoroscopy time (20 vs 24 minute, p <0.0001), and need for >1 valves (0.4 vs 5.5%, p = 0.0004). At 1-month, death/stroke (M-TAVI vs GA-TAVI 4.0 vs 6.5%) and a ""safety composite"" end point (death, stroke, transient ischemic attack, myocardial infarction, new dialysis, major vascular complication, major or life-threatening bleeding, and new pacemaker: 17.6% vs 21.1%) were similar (p = NS for both). At a median follow-up of 365 days, survival curves showed similar incidence of death/stroke as well as the safety composite end point between the groups. QoL scores were similar at baseline and 1-month after TAVI. In multivariable analyses, M-TAVI showed significant improvements in all parameters of procedural efficiency. In conclusion, M-TAVI is more efficient than GA-TAVI, with similar safety at 1-month and long-term, and similar QoL scores at 1 month.  "
Porcine heart valve, aorta and trachea cryopreservation and thawing using polydimethylsiloxane.  ;The most common cryopreservation protocols of biological tissues suitable for their further implantation has some disadvantages and limited to one sample per procedure with no possible repeated freezing in case of clinical needs. This study is aimed to improve a biological tissues cryopreservation by adding a new heat transfer fluid - polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). To evaluate its efficiency the porcine biological tissues (heart valves, aortic and trachea fragments) were cryopreserved and thawed in low-viscous PDMS. According to the computer simulation, the midsection cooling rate was up to 490 °C/min and the midsection thawing rate was up to 1140 °C/min with admissible temperature uniformity. Cryoprotectants and liquid nitrogen were not used. The quality of tissue cryopreservation was evaluated using a number of histological and immunohistochemical methods (Orcein, H&E, Anti-CD34, Anti-Vimentin, Anti-Actin staining). Cryopreserved tissues showed no significant morphological difference in comparison with control group both in case of immediate thawing, and after 2 months of low temperature storage. Computer simulation of heat transfer showed the thermal limitations of used approach for larger specimens. The use of PDMS is proposed for preservation of vascular tissue in order to implant it in the form of homotransplants or biobanking with the possible additional use of an internal hydrophilic coating to prevent hydrophobization.  
All that glitters is not gold: can videodensitometry replace echocardiography for the assessment of paravalvular aortic regurgitation?  ;DOI: 10.4244/EIJV15I14A218 PMID: 32044729 [Indexed for MEDLINE]  
Evaluation of the Safety and Effectiveness of Direct-Acting Oral Anticoagulants in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation and Coexisting Valvular Heart Disease.  ;"BACKGROUND: Current guidelines recommend direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) over warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and valvular heart disease (VHD) without a mechanical valve or moderate to severe mitral stenosis. However, real-world data to support the safety and efficacy of DOACs in this patient population are lacking. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to assess the safety and effectiveness of DOACs in patients with AF and VHD. METHODS: This retrospective chart review evaluated patients aged ≥ 18 years with a diagnosis of AF and at least moderate VHD on echocardiogram. Patients were included if they received ≥ 1 month of DOAC therapy from December 2016 to December 2018. Patients were excluded if they received dual antiplatelet therapy or had additional indications for anticoagulation. The primary outcomes were incidence of stroke or systemic embolism (SSE) and major bleeding. RESULTS: In total, 200 patients were included (disease type: aortic, n = 50; mitral, n = 50; tricuspid, n = 50; multivalve, n = 50). Most patients received apixaban (n = 133 [66.5%]) followed by rivaroxaban (n = 50 [25%]) and dabigatran (n = 17 [8.5%]). No patients received edoxaban. The mean CHA2DS2-VASc score was 4.25 and was similar among DOAC cohorts (p = 0.380). The overall SSE rate was 3.5% and was highest for dabigatran (n = 3 [17.6%]) compared with the other DOACs (apixaban, n = 1 [0.8%]; rivaroxaban, n = 3 [6%]; p = 0.001). Rates were similar among different valve types (aortic, n = 3 [6%]; mitral, n = 1 [2%]; tricuspid, n = 2 [4%]; multivalve, n = 1 [2%]; p = 0.653). The overall rate of major bleeding was 5.5% and did not differ among the DOACs (apixaban, n = 5 [3.8%]; rivaroxaban, n = 4 [8%]; dabigatran, n = 2 [11.8%]; p = 0.264) or valve type (aortic, n = 3 [6%]; mitral, n = 2 [4%]; tricuspid, n = 2 [4%]; multivalve, n = 4 [8%]; p = 0.787). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with AF and VHD, rates of major bleeding were similar among the DOACs and valve types; however, more patients receiving dabigatran experienced SSE. Further studies are needed to validate these findings.  "
Effect of pimobendan on left atrial function in dogs with preclinical myxomatous mitral valve disease.  ;BACKGROUND: Left atrial (LA) function is an important determinant of the left ventricular (LV) filling, playing a key role in maintaining optimal cardiac performance. Pimobendan is a phosphodiesterase III inhibitor with positive inotropic and vasodilator effects. The present study aims to investigate the effects of pimobendan on LA function in dogs with stage B2 myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD). AIM: The aim of this investigation was to study the effects of pimobendan on LA function in dogs with preclinical MMVD. METHODS: Twenty-seven dogs with stage B2 MMVD were retrospectively included. LA function was assessed before and 1-6 months following pimobendan initiation. For each dog, two-dimensional (2D) echocardiography was performed to assess LA diameter and volume for each phase of the LA cycle and to assess complete, passive, and active LA function. Pulsed-wave tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) of the left ventricular longitudinal myocardial velocity associated with atrial contraction (A'), both at the level of the interventricular septum and the LV free wall, was also used as an indicator of LA function. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in any of the left atrial variables pre- and posttreatment. CONCLUSION: Echocardiographic estimates of LA function by 2D diameters and volumes and TDI A' in dogs with MMVD do not change after treatment with pimobendan.  
Factors associated with the need for pulmonary valve replacement in asymptomatic patients with isolated pulmonary regurgitation after repair of tetralogy of Fallot: a cardiac magnetic resonance study.  ;"BACKGROUND: Pulmonary regurgitation (PR) is the most common late complication in patients after repair of tetralogy of Fallot (TOF). Most patients remain asymptomatic over years, but eventually, the compensatory mechanisms fail, leading to right ventricular (RV) dilation and dysfunction, limited exercise capacity, ventricular arrhythmia, and sudden death. AIMS: We aimed to evaluate associations between cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) parameters and the need for either surgical or percutaneous pulmonary valve replacement (PVR) in asymptomatic patients with significant PR after repair of TOF. METHODS: Of 209 patients with repaired TOF who had undergone a CMR study, we selected 61 asymptomatic patients with moderate‑to‑severe PR and followed them for up to 4 years (mean [SD], 21.4 [13.7] months). We excluded patients with residual ventricular septal defect, a peak RV outflow tract gradient of 30 mm Hg or higher, or at least moderate tricuspid regurgitation. RESULTS: Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses revealed that the ratio of RV to left ventricular (LV) volume (RV/ LV ratio; threshold >2.4) and PR fraction (PRF; threshold >33%) had acceptable discriminatory capacity to differentiate between patients requiring PVR and those treated conservatively. The Cox proportional hazards regression and the Kaplan–Meier curves revealed that the RV / LV ratio and PRF was significantly associated with the need for PVR. The combination of the RV / LV ratio and PRF provided significant discrimination in terms of survival without PVR (P <0.001; log‑rank test for trend). CONCLUSIONS: The RV/ LV ratio and PRF were significantly associated with the need for PVR in asymptomatic patients with isolated moderate‑to‑severe PR after repair of TOF.  "
Visual scoring of aortic valve calcifications on low-dose CT in lung cancer screening.  ;OBJECTIVES: To evaluate risk factors for prevalence and progression of aortic valve calcification (AVC) in lung cancer screening participants and also to assess the sensitivity and reliability of visual AVCs on low-dose CT (LDCT) for predicting aortic stenosis (AS) in high-risk smokers. METHODS: We reviewed 1225 consecutive participants in annual LDCT screening for lung cancer at the Mount Sinai Hospital between 2010 and 2017. Sensitivity and specificity of moderate/severe AVC score on LDCT to identify AS on echocardiogram were calculated for 126 participants who had both within 12 months. Using regression analyses, risk factors for AVC at baseline, for progression, and for new AVC on annual rounds of screening were identified. Reliability of AVC assessment on LDCT was assessed by comparing visual AVC scores (1) with standard-dose, electrocardiography (ECG)-gated CT for 31 participants who had both within 12 months and (2) with Agatston scores of 1225 participants and by determining (3) the intra-reader agreement of 1225 participants. RESULTS: Visual AVC scores on LDCT had substantial agreement with the severity of AS on echocardiography and substantial inter-observer and excellent intra-observer agreement. Sensitivity and specificity of moderate/severe visual AVC scores for moderate/severe AS on echocardiogram were 100% and 94%, respectively. Significant predictors for baseline AVC were male sex (OR = 2.52), age (OR10 years = 2.87), and coronary artery calcification score (OR = 1.18), the significant predictor for AVC progression after baseline was pack-years of smoking (HR10 packyears = 1.14), and significant predictors for new AVC on annual LDCT were male sex (HR = 1.51), age (HR10 years = 2.17), CAC (HR = 1.09) and BMI (HR = 1.06). CONCLUSIONS: AVC scores on LDCT should be documented, especially in lung cancer screening program. KEY POINTS: • LDCT screening for lung cancer provides an opportunity to identify lung cancer and cardiovascular disease in asymptomatic smokers. • Visual aortic valve calcification scores could be reliably evaluated on LDCT and had substantial agreement with the severity of aortic valve stenosis on echocardiography. • Sensitivity and specificity of moderate/severe visual AVC scores on LDCT for moderate/severe AS on echocardiogram were 100% and 94%, respectively.  
Importance of combined assessment of skeletal muscle mass and density by computed tomography in predicting clinical outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve replacement.  ;"Skeletal muscle mass (SMM) as calculated by computed tomography (CT) is a predictor of all-cause mortality after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), but it remains unclear whether using CT-determined density of skeletal muscle has additive prognostic value. We utilized the Japanese multicenter registry data of 1375 patients who underwent CT prior to TAVR. Sarcopenia status was defined by the CT-derived SMM index (threshold: men, 55.4 cm2/m2; women, 38.9 cm2/m2). The threshold for high and low CT density was based on the median value of the entire cohort (men: 33.4 HU; women: 29.5 HU). Sarcopenia was observed in 802 patients (58.3%) overall. Patients were categorized into non-sarcopenia and high-CT density (n = 298), non-sarcopenia and low-CT density (n = 275), sarcopenia and high-CT density (n = 399), and sarcopenia and low-CT density (n = 403) groups, and procedural outcomes and mortality compared. The cumulative 3-year mortality rates in these groups were 18%, 27%, 24%, and 32%, respectively. Cox-regression multivariate analysis revealed that low-CT density (compared with high-CT density) and sarcopenia and low-CT density (compared with non-sarcopenia and high-CT density as reference) increased mortality after TAVR (hazard ratios [HR]: 1.35 and 1.43, 95% confidence intervals [Cis]: 1.06-1.72 and 1.00-2.08, p = 0.01, and 0.049, respectively). However, sarcopenia alone was not related to an increased risk of mortality (HR 1.30, 95% CI 0.99-1.69, p = 0.52). In conclusion, CT density-based skeletal muscle quality assessment combined with the SMM index improves prediction of adverse outcomes after TAVR.  "
Identifying critically important cardiovascular outcomes for trials in hemodialysis: an international survey with patients, caregivers and health professionals.  ;"BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major contributor to morbidity and mortality in people on hemodialysis (HD). Cardiovascular outcomes are reported infrequently and inconsistently across trials in HD. This study aimed to identify the priorities of patients/caregivers and health professionals (HPs) for CVD outcomes to be incorporated into a core outcome set reported in all HD trials. METHODS: In an international online survey, participants rated the absolute importance of 10 cardiovascular outcomes (derived from a systematic review) on a 9-point Likert scale, with 7-9 being critically important. The relative importance was determined using a best-worst scale. Likert means, medians and proportions and best-worst preference scores were calculated for each outcome. Comments were thematically analyzed. RESULTS: Participants included 127 (19%) patients/caregivers and 549 (81%) HPs from 53 countries, of whom 530 (78%) completed the survey in English and 146 (22%) in Chinese. All but one cardiovascular outcome ('valve replacement') was rated as critically important (Likert 7-9) by all participants; 'sudden cardiac death', 'heart attack', 'stroke' and 'heart failure' were all rated at the top by patients/caregivers (median Likert score 9). Patients/caregivers ranked the same four outcomes as the most important outcomes with mean preference scores of 6.2 (95% confidence interval 4.8-7.5), 5.9 (4.6-7.2), 5.3 (4.0-6.6) and 4.9 (3.6-6.3), respectively. The same four outcomes were ranked most highly by HPs. We identified five themes underpinning the prioritization of outcomes: 'clinical equipoise and potential for intervention', 'specific or attributable to HD', 'severity or impact on the quality of life', 'strengthen knowledge and education', and 'inextricably linked burden and risk'. CONCLUSIONS: Patients and HPs believe that all cardiovascular outcomes are of critical importance but consistently identify sudden cardiac death, myocardial infarction, stroke and heart failure as the most important outcomes to be measured in all HD trials.

Femoral hernia in the era of TAVI - a potential obstacle for transfemoral approach: a case report and literature review.  ;BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) via total percutaneous transfemoral approach is an increasingly common technique for aortic stenosis treatment. It is primarily indicated in elderly with serious comorbidities. The epidemiology of these patients tends to overlap with the incidence of femoral hernia (FH). The appearance of hernia sac at the approach site and insufficient preoperational examination can lead to serious complications. We present the first-ever reported case of subsequent femoral hernia repair during transfemoral TAVI. CASE PRESENTATION: This report presents a case of FH/TAVI coincidence and literature review of its epidemiology. Literature review was performed to analyze similarities of femoral hernia and TAVI. The case describes an 84-year old female referred for elective TAVI. Intraoperation incarcerated femoral hernia was noticed and directly repaired. Further TAVI steps were performed on regular basis. A 2-year follow-up reported no local and general complications related to procedures. CONCLUSIONS: Unsuspected femoral hernia found subsequently with transfemoral TAVI may become a growing problem. The number of TAVI performed rises with indications expansion. Femoral hernia repairs constitute from 2 to 4% of all groin hernia. Both TAVI and FH are connected with elderly. Despite the fact of low FH incidence, growing number of TAVI performed and ageing of population, corresponds with higher possibility of complications. Most of these complications may end up fatal as they would involve high-risk patients. Insufficient attention is paid by cardiologists to the possible hernia appearance in the access site as this issue has been hardly ever presented in literature. Concomitant FH in TAVI patients should always be excluded in order to avoid serious complications. The case we report presents a successful subsequent FH repair during TAVI procedure. Further studies have to be conducted to provide data on how such problems ought to be managed.

New Appearance of Fragmented QRS as a Predictor of Ventricular Arrhythmic Events in Patients With Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy.  ;"BACKGROUND: Multiple spikes in the QRS complex (fragmented QRS [fQRS]) on 12-lead electrocardiography have been associated with ventricular arrhythmic events (VAEs) in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). The aim of this study was to assess the association between new appearances of fQRS and cardiac events in patients with HCM.Methods and Results:The association between baseline fQRS and cardiac events, namely VAEs, heart failure-related hospitalization, and all-cause death, was evaluated retrospectively in 146 HCM patients (46 patients with fQRS, 100 without fQRS). The median follow-up was 5.3 years. Cardiac events occurred in 29 patients with baseline fQRS and 32 patients without baseline fQRS (63% vs. 32%; P<0.001). VAEs occurred in a significantly larger percentage of patients with than without baseline fQRS (54% vs. 23%, respectively; P<0.001). Of the 100 patients without baseline fQRS, 33 had a new appearance of fQRS during the 4.6-year follow-up, whereas 67 did not. VAEs occurred more frequently in the 33 patients with the appearance of fQRS than in those without (42% vs. 13%, respectively; P=0.001). Multivariable analysis showed that the new appearance of fQRS documented before VAEs was associated with VAEs (hazard ratio 4.29, 95% confidence interval 1.81-10.2; P=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The new appearance of fQRS was associated with an increased risk of VAEs in HCM patients.  "
Comparison of clinical outcomes after transcarotid and transsubclavian versus transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation: A propensity-matched analysis.  ;"BACKGROUND: Transcarotid and trans-subclavian access routes are increasingly used as alternative approaches for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) when transfemoral access is not suitable. However, concerns remain about the risk of periprocedural stroke and long-term outcomes following transcarotid/trans-subclavian TAVI. AIMS: The present study sought to compare early and long-term outcomes of transcarotid/trans-subclavian TAVI versus transfemoral TAVI after propensity-score matching. METHODS: The 260 patients who underwent TAVI through a transfemoral (n=220), transcarotid (n=32) or trans-subclavian (n=8) approach at our institution over a 4-year period were identified. A 1:1 matching based on propensity score was performed, and led to a study population of 80 patients (40 transfemoral and 40 transcarotid/trans-subclavian). Primary endpoints were early complications; secondary endpoints were long-term outcomes. RESULTS: There were no differences in the baseline characteristics of the two groups. At 30 days after TAVI there were no significant differences between transfemoral and transcarotid/trans-subclavian TAVI in terms of death rates (5% vs 5%, respectively; P=1.00) and stroke rates (5% vs 2.5%, respectively; P=1.00). After a median follow-up of 21 months, the risk of death (P=0.95), stroke (P=0.82) and myocardial infarction (P=0.16) did not differ between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: After propensity-score matching, no significant differences in early and long-term outcomes were observed between transfemoral and transcarotid/trans-subclavian TAVI. These findings should encourage heart teams to consider a transcarotid or trans-subclavian approach when transfemoral access is unavailable.  "
Continuous-Flow Left Ventricular Assist Devices and Valvular Heart Disease: A Comprehensive Review.  ;Mechanical circulatory support with implantable durable continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices (CF-LVADs) represents an established surgical treatment option for patients with advanced heart failure refractory to guideline-directed medical therapy. CF-LVAD therapy has been demonstrated to offer significant survival, functional, and quality-of-life benefits. However, nearly one-half of patients with advanced heart failure undergoing implantation of a CF-LVAD have important valvular heart disease (VHD) present at the time of device implantation or develop VHD during support that can lead to worsening right or left ventricular dysfunction and result in development of recurrent heart failure, more frequent adverse events, and higher mortality. In this review, we summarize the recent evidence related to the pathophysiology and treatment of VHD in the setting of CF-LAVD support and include a review of the specific valve pathologies of aortic insufficiency (AI), mitral regurgitation (MR), and tricuspid regurgitation (TR). Recent data demonstrate an increasing appreciation and understanding of how VHD may adversely affect the hemodynamic benefits of CF-LVAD support. This is particularly relevant for MR, where increasing evidence now demonstrates that persistent MR after CF-LVAD implantation can contribute to worsening right heart failure and recurrent heart failure symptoms. Standard surgical interventions and novel percutaneous approaches for treatment of VHD in the setting of CF-LVAD support, such as transcatheter aortic valve replacement or transcatheter mitral valve repair, are available, and indications to intervene for VHD in the setting of CF-LVAD support continue to evolve.  
CCS/CHFS Heart Failure Guidelines: Clinical Trial Update on Functional Mitral Regurgitation, SGLT2 Inhibitors, ARNI in HFpEF, and Tafamidis in Amyloidosis.  ;"In this update, we focus on selected topics of high clinical relevance for health care providers who treat patients with heart failure (HF), on the basis of clinical trials published after 2017. Our objective was to review the evidence, and provide recommendations and practical tips regarding the management of candidates for the following HF therapies: (1) transcatheter mitral valve repair in HF with reduced ejection fraction; (2) a novel treatment for transthyretin amyloidosis or transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis; (3) angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibition in patients with HF and preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF); and (4) sodium glucose cotransport inhibitors for the prevention and treatment of HF in patients with and without type 2 diabetes. We emphasize the roles of optimal guideline-directed medical therapy and of multidisciplinary teams when considering transcatheter mitral valve repair, to ensure excellent evaluation and care of those patients. In the presence of suggestive clinical indices, health care providers should consider the possibility of cardiac amyloidosis and proceed with proper investigation. Tafamidis is the first agent shown in a prospective study to alter outcomes in patients with transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis. Patient subgroups with HFpEF might benefit from use of sacubitril/valsartan, however, further data are needed to clarify the effect of this therapy in patients with HFpEF. Sodium glucose cotransport inhibitors reduce the risk of incident HF, HF-related hospitalizations, and cardiovascular death in patients with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. A large clinical trial recently showed that dapagliflozin provides significant outcome benefits in well treated patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction (left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 40%), with or without type 2 diabetes.

Effect of Concomitant Tricuspid Valve Surgery With Left Ventricular Assist Device Implantation.  ;"BACKGROUND: Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is common in advanced heart failure (HF) patients. However, the effect of concomitant tricuspid valve repair or replacement (tricuspid valve intervention [TVI]) with left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation is controversial. The aim of this study was to investigate the longitudinal trend of TR after LVAD implantation and the effect of TVI on the TR trend and clinical outcomes. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed patients at our institution who underwent LVAD implantation between April 2014 and August 2018. We evaluated the grade of TR by echocardiography before and after LVAD implantation. Moderate or greater TR was defined as significant. RESULTS: Among 199 consecutive patients, 194 had at least 2 echocardiographic TR assessments before and after LVAD implantation. Of these patients, 108 were included in the TVI-positive (TVI+) group and 86 in the TVI-negative (TVI-) group. In the TVI+ group, the prevalence of significant TR decreased from 52% to about 20% in the first 6 months after implantation (P < .01). Overall survival and HF readmission-free survival were comparable between the TVI+ and TVI- patients. In contrast, patients in both groups who had significant postoperative TR during early follow-up had worse 2-year HF readmission-free survival (36% in patients with significant postoperative TR vs 55% in those without significant postoperative TR; P = .028). CONCLUSIONS: Concomitant TVI with LVAD implantation improved TR in most patients but did not have an impact on clinical outcomes. Significant postoperative TR after LVAD implantation, in patients with and without TVI, was associated with worse HF-free outcomes.  "
Valve Sparing Aortic Root Replacement for Aortico-Left Ventricular Tunnel With Bicuspid Aortic Valve.  ;Aortico-left ventricular tunnel (ALVT) is a rare, abnormal, paravalvular communication between the aorta and the left ventricle. ALVT can be associated with a variety of congenital heart diseases, but there are only a few reports of ALVT associated with bicuspid aortic valve (BAV). Herein, we report a case of an 11-year-old boy who successfully underwent aortic valve sparing root replacement for ALVT with BAV and aortic root aneurysm.  
Hemodynamics rounds: Hemodynamics of mitral valve interventions.  ;"Mitral valvulopathy presents as regurgitation, stenosis, or mixed disease and can occur in both native and prosthetic valves. Such disease develops in conjunction with pathophysiologic changes in the left atrium (LA) and drives changes in LA compliance, pressure, and thus clinical syndromes. With advances in the understanding and treatment of structural heart disease and in the setting of higher-risk patient populations, less-invasive transcatheter approaches have become increasingly commonplace in the treatment of mitral valve disease. Over time, transcatheter mitral valve interventions have evolved to include paravalvular leak closure, mitral valve repair, and mitral valve replacement. Parallel to this evolution, advances in invasive intracardiac pressure monitoring, particularly at the level of the LA, have also occurred. These advances emphasize the unique interplay between mitral valve disease and LA function; account for limitations of noninvasive assessment; and guide beneficial outcomes in each area of transcatheter mitral valve intervention. As a result, continuous transseptal LA pressure monitoring has developed into an indispensable instrument in successful percutaneous mitral valve intervention, complementing traditional noninvasive assessment.

Mitral Annular Calcification: Association with Atherosclerosis and Clinical Implications.  ;"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review summarizes the pathophysiology of mitral annular calcification (MAC) with recent findings and current strategies for diagnosis and treatment. RECENT FINDINGS: Major factors in MAC development seem to be shear stress of the flow past the mitral valve, local inflammation, and dysregulation in regulators of mineral metabolism. MAC itself poses daunting technical challenges. Implanting a valve on top of the calcium bar might lead to paravalvular leak (PVL) that is less likely to heal. Annular decalcification allows for better valve seating and potentially better healing and less PVL. This, however, comes with the risk for catastrophic atrioventricular groove disruption. MAC can be sharply dissected with the scalpel; the annulus can be reconstructed with the autologous pericardium. Transcatheter mitral valve replacement is a promising approach in the treatment of patients who are deemed high-risk surgical candidates with severe MAC. MAC is a multifactorial disease that has some commonalities with atherosclerosis, mainly regarding lipid accumulation and calcium deposition. It is of great clinical importance, being a risk marker of cardiovascular events (including sudden death) and, with its progression, can have a negative impact on patients' lives.  "
DELay of Appearance of sYmptoms of Canine Degenerative Mitral Valve Disease Treated with Spironolactone and Benazepril: the DELAY Study.  ;INTRODUCTION: Efficacy of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockade using angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) in dogs with preclinical myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) is controversial. HYPOTHESIS: Administration of spironolactone (2-4 mg q 24 h) and benazepril (0.25-0.5 mg q 24 h) in dogs with preclinical MMVD, not receiving any other cardiac medications, delays the onset of heart failure (HF) and cardiac-related death. Moreover, it reduces the progression of the disease as indicated by echocardiographic parameters and level of cardiac biomarkers N-terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and cardiac troponin I (cTnI). ANIMALS: 184 dogs with pre-clinical MMVD and left atrium-to-aortic root ratio (LA:Ao) ≥1.6 and normalized left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDDn) ≥1.7. METHODS: This is a prospective, randomized, multicenter, single-blinded, placebo-controlled study. Primary outcome variable was time-to-onset of first occurrence of HF or cardiac death. Secondary end points included effect of treatment on progression of the disease based on echocardiographic and radiographic parameters, as well as variations of NT-proBNP and cTnI concentrations. RESULTS: The median time to primary end point was 902 days (95% confidence interval (CI) 682-not available) for the treatment group and 1139 days (95% CI 732-NA) for the control group (p = 0.45). Vertebral heart score (p = 0.05), LA:Ao (p < 0.001), LVEDDn (p < 0.001), trans-mitral E peak velocity (p = 0.011), and NT-proBNP (p = 0.037) were lower at the end of study in the treatment group. CONCLUSIONS: This study failed in demonstrating that combined administration of spironolactone and benazepril delays onset of HF in dogs with preclinical MMVD. However, such treatment induces beneficial effects on cardiac remodeling and these results could be of clinical relevance.  
Tricuspid valve repair in children with hypoplastic left heart syndrome: impact of timing and mechanism on outcome.  ;"OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to evaluate the results of tricuspid valve repair (TVr) in patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome during staged reconstruction, focussing on the timing of the repair and the mechanisms of tricuspid regurgitation (TR). METHODS: Records of 44 children with hypoplastic left heart syndrome who underwent a total of 62 tricuspid valve (TV) procedures during staged reconstruction were retrospectively analysed. RESULTS: TVr was performed before stage II in 4 (9%) patients, at stage II in 23 (52%) patients, between stages II and III in 3 (7%) patients and at stage III in 14 (32%) patients. The median age at the first TV procedure was 5 months. At surgery, TR emanated commonly from the anteroseptal commissure in 21 (48%) patients. Anterior leaflet prolapse was observed most frequently (n = 23; 52%), followed by septal leaflet restriction (n = 22; 50%), dilated annulus (n = 21; 48%) and cleft anterior leaflet (n = 9; 21%). Surgical techniques included commissuroplasty in 27 (61.4%) patients, leaflet adaptation in 20 (44%) patients, partial annuloplasty in 11 (25%) patients, chordal reconstruction in 10 (23%) patients and cleft closure in 10 (23%) patients. Among all 44 patients, 27 (61%) patients had preoperative grade III TR and 17 (39%) patients had grade IV; postoperatively, there were no patients with grade IV, 25 patients with grade III (57%), 10 patients with grade II (23%) and 6 patients with grade I (14%). Fifteen patients required redo TV surgeries. Reoperation-free survival was 52% at 5 years. Lower weight at initial TVr predicted mortality [hazard ratio (HR) 0.7, P = 0.044] and reoperation (HR 0.8, P = 0.015). TVr before stage II was a risk for both reoperation (HR 5.5, P = 0.042) and TV replacement (HR 36.9, P = 0.013). Among morphological factors, septal leaflet restriction was a risk for reoperation (HR 4.7, P = 0.017) and anterior (HR 4.7, P = 0.037) and posterior (HR 7.3, P = 0.015) leaflet chordal anomaly for TV replacement. CONCLUSIONS: Anterior leaflet prolapse and septal leaflet restriction are the main mechanisms of TR in hypoplastic left heart syndrome. Early-onset TR before stage II predicts worse outcome. Refinements to repair techniques in early infancy, especially for septal leaflet restrictions and chordal anomalies, are mandatory to improve outcomes.  "
Aortic Valve Regurgitation following Transthoracic Open Surgical Ligation of Patent Ductus Arteriosus.  ;"BACKGROUND: Transthoracic open surgical ligation (TTOSL) of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) remains the most readily available and affordable treatment option in resource-poor countries such as Nigeria. OBJECTIVES: To determine the incidence and outcome of aortic valve regurgitation (AR) following TTOSL of PDA. METHODS: Retrospective audit of consecutive patients who underwent TTOSL of PDA over a 4½-year period (January 2015 to June 2019) at the OAUTHC, Ile-Ife, Nigeria. Hospital records including echocardiograms (pre-operative, immediate post-operative and follow-up performed a day after TTOSL, at 1, 3 and 12 months) were reviewed for presence and severity of AR. RESULTS: Twenty-six patients (11 males and 15 females) aged 3 months 24 years (Mean = 3.16 years) had TTOS PDA ligation. Only 3 (11.5%) patients had AR pre-operatively; 2 graded moderate AR and 1 graded mild. Twenty (76.9 %) patients had immediate post-operative AR; 4 (20.0%) of which were moderate and the others (80.0%) were mild. Eighteen (69.2%) patients still had AR post-operative day 1; 16 were mild and the rest 2 which were moderate were the same patients that had AR pre-operatively. At 3 months follow-up, 6 of 20 patients (30.0%) had AR; all were mild. Only 2 of 18 (11.1%) followed up for 12 months had AR. They both had had moderate AR pre-operatively which were now graded as mild. There was no mortality. CONCLUSION: Aortic regurgitation is common after TTOSL of PDA. However, in most instances, it is mild and transient.  "
Caught-off guard: Unguarded mitral valve orifice in usual atrial arrangement with discordant atrioventricular connections and pulmonary atresia.  ;Unguarding of an atrioventricular valvar orifice is a rare form of congenital heart disease that requires staged functionally univentricular palliation. Unguarding of the mitral valvar orifice has previously been reported in the setting of mirror-imaged atrial arrangement. We report a neonate with unguarding of the mitral valvar orifice in the setting of usual atrial arrangement, but with discordant atrioventricular connections and pulmonary atresia.  
Balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty in neonates with critical pulmonary stenosis: Jugular or femoral.  ;"BACKGROUND: Critical pulmonary stenosis (PS) is one of the life-threatening congenital heart diseases which present during the neonatal period with cyanosis. Surgical valvotomy was once the procedure of choice for critical PS; however, balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty (BPV) has now become the standard treatment. Although the procedure is usually simple, crossing the pulmonary valve from the femoral vein can be difficult, especially when severe tricuspid regurgitation and right atrium dilatation are present. In such patients, the maneuver can be simplified by using the right internal jugular vein approach. However, many operators are reluctant to use this approach because of unfamiliarity with the technique, potential complications, and paucity of reports. Until now, there is no literature describing BPV using the transjugular approach in neonates, also none directly comparing the transfemoral and transjugular approaches. OBJECTIVE: We compared transjugular with the transfemoral approach in terms of procedure time and complications. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study. Participants were neonates with critical PS undergoing BPV in the National Cardiovascular Center Harapan Kita from 2013 to 2018. RESULTS: Of 15 neonates undergoing BPV, eight were done using the transjugular approach and seven using the femoral approach. Mean age and weight in both groups was similar. In all eight patients using transjugular approach, crossing the pulmonary valve was consistently quick and easy. The total procedural time, pulmonary crossing time, and fluoro time was significantly shorter using the transjugular approach (65 ± 8 vs. 108 ± 17.8 min, P < 0.05; 22 ± 3.1 vs. 45 ± 14.8 min, P < 0.01; 29 ± 13 vs. 67 ± 35 min, P < 0.05). There were no complications relating to vascular access. Moreover, the BPV procedure itself demonstrated comparable results in both groups. CONCLUSION: BPV using the transjugular approach is safe and effective to relieve critical PS in neonates compared to the transfemoral approach.  "
Annular versus supra-annular sizing for transcatheter aortic valve replacement in bicuspid aortic valve disease.  ;"BACKGROUND: CT measurement of supra-annular area (SA) has been proposed as an alternative to annular area (AA) for sizing of trancatheter valves in biscuspid aortic valves (BAV). This study examines the reproducibility of SA and AA measurements and their potential impact on downstream transcatheter heart valve sizing and clinical outcomes. METHODS: 44 consecutive patients (mean age: 73 ± 15 years, 57% male) undergoing CTA with subsequent SAPIEN 3 valve insertion for severe bicuspid aortic stenosis (AS) were included. AA was measured at the basal ring. SA was measured by generating a circle defined by the intercommisural distance. AA and SA were measured by 2 independent observers. Baseline characteristics, TAVR procedural data, and discharge echocardiography data were collected. RESULTS: The SA was significantly larger than the AA (562 ± 146mm2 vs. 518 ± 112mm2,p = 0.013). Interobserver agreement was high using both techniques (ICC AA = 0.98,p < 0.001; SA = 0.80,p < 0.001), but with narrower limits of agreement with AA measurements (mean difference (limits of agreement): AA = -3mm2 (22; 19), SA = -16mm2 (-92; 76)). AA-based device sizing demonstrated substantial agreement with final valve inserted (κ = 0.72,p < 0.001), while SA demonstrated fair agreement (κ = 0.40,p < 0.001). There was no difference in post TAVR gradients, paravalvular leakage or valve success between patients with concordant sizing between AA and SA, and those in whom SA would have suggested an alternate valve size. CONCLUSIONS: Supra-annular sizing is less reproducible than annular sizing, with no difference in procedural complication rates in patients in whom supra-annular sizing would have altered the device size used. These results suggest no role for supra-annular sizing in current clinical practice.  "

Simulation study of transcatheter heart valve implantation in patients with stenotic bicuspid aortic valve.  ;"Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) anatomy has routinely been considered an exclusion in the setting of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) because of the large dimension of the aortic annulus having a more calcified, bulky, and irregular shape. The study aims to develop a patient-specific computational framework to virtually simulate TAVI in stenotic BAV patients using the Edwards SAPIEN 3 valve (S3) and its improved version SAPIEN 3 Ultra and quantify stent frame deformity as well as the severity of paravalvular leakage (PVL). Specifically, the aortic root anatomy of n.9 BAV patients who underwent TAVI was reconstructed from pre-operative CT imaging. Crimping and deployment of S3 frame were performed and then followed by fluid-solid interaction analysis to simulate valve leaflet dynamics throughout the entire cardiac cycle. Modeling revealed that the S3 stent frame expanded well on BAV anatomy with an elliptical shape at the aortic annulus. Comparison of predicted S3 deformity as assessed by eccentricity and expansion indices demonstrated a good agreement with the measurement obtained from CT imaging. Blood particle flow analysis demonstrated a backward blood jet during diastole, whereas the predicted PVL flows corresponded well with those determined by transesophageal echocardiography. This study represents a further step towards the use of personalized simulations to virtually plan TAVI, aiming at improving not only the efficacy of the implantation but also the exploration of ""off-label"" applications as the TAVI in the setting of BAV patients.

Congenital heart defects in Noonan syndrome: Diagnosis, management, and treatment.  ;"Noonan syndrome is a pleomorphic genetic disorder, in which a high percentage of affected individuals have cardiovascular involvement, most prevalently various forms of congenital heart disease (i.e., pulmonary valve stenosis, septal defects, left-sided lesions, and complex forms with multiple anomalies). Care includes attentiveness to several comorbidities, some directly impacting cardiac management (bleeding diatheses and lymphatic anomalies). More than 50% of patients with Noonan syndrome harbor PTPN11 pathogenic variation, which results in hyperactivation of RAS/mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling. Several other disease genes with similar biological effects have been uncovered for NS and phenotypically related disorders, collectively called the RASopathies. Molecular diagnosis with gene resequencing panels is now widely available, but phenotype variability and in some cases, subtlety, continues to make identification of Noonan syndrome difficult. Until genetic testing becomes universal for patients with congenital heart disease, alertness to Noonan syndrome's broad clinical presentations remains crucial. Genotype-phenotype associations for Noonan syndrome enable better prognostication for affected patients when a molecular diagnosis is established. We still lack Noonan syndrome-specific treatment; however, newly developed anticancer RAS pathway inhibitors could fill that gap if safety and efficacy can be established for indications such as pulmonary valve stenosis.

Predicting the risk of late futile outcome after transcatheter aortic valve implantation.  ;"BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) for aortic stenosis (AS) risk assessment is still developing and mostly concerned with mortality in the periprocedural period. We therefore sought to develop and then validate a score to predict 1-year adverse outcome. METHODS: Patients that underwent TAVI for severe AS in the Israeli registry. Patients with unsuccessful/suboptimal implantation were excluded. The cohort was split to derivation/validation cohorts by a ratio of 70:30. The outcome was defined as 1-year composite of mortality, stroke, and no improvement in NYHA class (vs. baseline). Logistic regression was used to fit the prediction model. RESULTS: Out of 2,440 patients meeting inclusion criteria, 276 were excluded, leaving 2,160 patients for both cohorts. At 1 year, 299 (14%) patients experienced the adverse (""futile"") outcome. The derived prediction model included mean aortic valve (AV) gradient, previous pacemaker, previous oncological disease, need for diuretics, baseline NYHA class, hemoglobin and creatinine levels, and nonfemoral access site. The model's area under the curve (AUC) was 0.69 in the derivation and 0.70 in the validation cohort. Performance of other scores in the validation cohort were lower (0.60 for STS, 0.55 for Euroscore2, 0.56 for TVT score, and 0.53 for TAVI2-score, p = .03). Based on three risk tiers, patients had a low risk (20/306, 7% futility), a medium risk (50/304, 17%), and high risk (18/37, 49%) for futility. CONCLUSIONS: The TAVI futility risk model can be used to provide further insight regarding prediction measures and/or patients' outcomes outside of the periprocedural period (NCT02023060).  "
Study of transesophageal echocardiography in young patients (<40 years) with acute arterial ischemic stroke: A pilot study.  ;BACKGROUND: The aim is to study cardiac abnormalities as detected by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) in young patients (<40 years) presenting with acute ischemic arterial stroke. METHODS: A cross-sectional observational study was conducted in young patients aged <40 years presenting with acute arterial ischemic stroke without any valvular heart disease, prosthetic valve, or previously diagnosed atrial fibrillation (AF). TEE was performed in all eligible patients preferably within the first week of the onset of ischemic arterial stroke. All patients with normal TEE underwent holter to rule out paroxysmal AF. RESULTS: Totally, 40 young patients were included in the study. Mean age was 35.17 (SD [standard deviation] ± 2.99) years. TEE abnormalities were noted in total 13 (32.5%) patients, of which patent foramen ovale was the most common cardiac abnormality in eight (20%) patients followed by left atrial appendage clot in three (7.5%) and atrial septal aneurysm in two (5%) patients. One patient (2.5%) was observed with atrial septal aneurysm along with a sieved septum. All the patients with normal TEE underwent holter, and four of 27 (14.8%) of these patients were noted to have paroxysmal AF. CONCLUSION: Cardiac abnormalities on TEE and holter were detected in 42.5% of the young patients with idiopathic arterial stroke. TEE abnormality was noted in 33% (13/40), whereas AF on holter was seen in 14.8% (4/27) with normal TEE. Thus, probable cardioembolic stroke was responsible for acute ischemic stroke in 42.5% (17/40) of young patients in the absence of valvular heart disease, prosthetic valves, and persistent/permanent AF.  
Predictive factors and long-term prognosis of transcatheter aortic valve implantation-associated endocarditis.  ;"BACKGROUND: There are still limited data regarding transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) endocarditis. OBJECTIVES: The objective of the present study was to investigate the predictor and long-term outcome of TAVI endocarditis. METHODS: Consecutive patients undergoing TAVI at the University of Bonn were prospectively enrolled in this study. Transcatheter heart valve (THV) endocarditis was defined according to Duke criteria. The primary outcome was all-cause death within a 5-year follow-up. RESULTS: 1448 successful TAVI patients were eligible for the study and 17 patients (1.2%) developed THV endocarditis during the follow-up period (median 294 days). A multivariable logistic regression analysis identified age (odds ratio [OR] 0.90; P = 0.001) and residual paravalvular leakage (PVL) ≥ 2 after TAVI (OR 5.15; P = 0.015) as the main predictors for the occurrence of TAVI endocarditis. Additional analyses revealed that younger patients were significantly associated with higher rates of diabetes (P = 0.001), hemodialysis (P < 0.001), prior cardiac surgery (P < 0.001), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (P < 0.001). A Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a significantly worse prognosis in TAVI patients with endocarditis than in patients without (log-rank; P = 0.03) during the 5-year follow-up. A multivariable Cox proportional hazard analysis revealed that TAVI endocarditis is an independent predictor of long-term mortality (hazard ratio 4.17; 95% CI 1.91-9.07; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our study identified lower age and residual PVL ≥ 2 as predictors for THV endocarditis, which itself may be considered as an independent predictor of long-term mortality after TAVI.  "

Prediction of Perinatal Mortality in Ebstein's Anomaly Diagnosed in the Second Trimester of Pregnancy.  ;"OBJECTIVES: Firstly, to describe the outcome of a series of fetuses with Ebstein's anomaly (EA) and, secondly, to study the utility of different second-trimester echocardiographic parameters to predict fetal and neonatal mortality. METHODS: 39 fetuses with EA diagnosed between 18 and 28 weeks of gestation were included. Fetal echocardiography included the cardiothoracic ratio (CTR); right atrial (RA) area index; displacement of the tricuspid valve (TV); tricuspid regurgitation; pulmonary artery; and ductus arteriosus flow characteristics. Additionally, 2 novel parameters were obtained: the relative RA area ratio (RA area/cardiac area) and the TV displacement index (TVDI, TV displacement distance/longi-tudinal diameter of the left ventricle). Correlation between the echocardiographic variables and the primary outcome of perinatal mortality or survival at 1 year of life was evaluated. RESULTS: From the initial cohort, 8 cases were excluded due to complex congenital heart defects. Termination of pregnancy (TOP) was performed in 15 cases, and fetal death was diagnosed in 3 cases. In the live-born cohort of 13 patients, 4 died in the neonatal period, yielding a perinatal survival rate of 29 and 56%, respectively, after excluding TOP cases. Compared with survivors, nonsurvivors showed a significantly higher CTR (56.7 ± 16.2 vs. 42.6 ± 8.6; p = 0.04), relative RA area ratio (0.39 ± 0.13 vs. 0.25 ± 0.05; p = 0.01), and TVDI (0.62 ± 0.17 vs. 0.44 ± 0.12; p = 0.03) at diagnosis. The best model to predict perinatal mortality was obtained by using a scoring system which included the relative RA area ratio and TVDI (AUC 0.905 [95% CI 0.732-1.000]). CONCLUSIONS: Fetuses with a relative RA area ratio ≥0.29 and TVDI ≥0.65 at the second trimester have the highest risk of dying in the perinatal stage.  "
Rheumatic Mitral Stenosis: Long-Term Follow-Up of Adult Patients with Nonsevere Initial Disease.  ;INTRODUCTION: There is no consensus regarding the natural history of rheumatic mitral stenosis (MS) among adults presenting with nonsevere disease. This study aims to describe the progression of stenosis among adult rheumatic MS patients, to identify predictive factors for progression, and to assess the incidence of complications. METHODS: A retrospective cohort analysis was performed among patients with rheumatic MS treated at a single center. Eighty-five patients were included with mild to moderate MS, ≥30 years old on initial echocardiography. Demographics, medical history, echocardiographic reports over at least 10 years, and related complications were obtained from a computerized database. RESULTS: Over a period of 13.1 ± 2.38 years, 75 patients (88%) had no significant progression in stenosis severity. The final echocardiographic assessment demonstrated 2 groups with a significant difference between them regarding the mitral valve area (1.58 ± 0.44 vs. 1.1 ± 0.26 cm2, p = 0.001) and mean valvular pressure gradient (6.27 ± 2.52 vs. 8.5 ± 2.69 mm Hg, p = 0.01). Patients with indolent MS (group A) were compared to patients with progressive disease (group B), and a higher percent of Bedouin patients were found in group B (OR 8.036, p = 0.015). No significant differences were found in other parameters. Complications including atrial fibrillation, cerebral ischemic events, and impaired right ventricle function, although frequent, were not statistically different between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: An indolent natural progression of rheumatic MS was observed in our study. Despite this finding, it still has potentially deleterious effects. Bedouin patients have a higher risk for progressive disease.  
Underweight is associated with inferior short and long-term outcomes after MitraClip implantation: Results from the German TRAnscatheter mitral valve interventions (TRAMI) registry.  ;"BACKGROUND: Underweight and obesity represent classical risk factors for adverse outcome in patients treated for cardiovascular disease. AIMS: The current analysis examines the impact of underweight, overweight and obesity on intra-hospital, short and long-term outcomes in patients treated by MitraClip therapy. METHODS AND RESULTS: From August 2010 until July 2013, 799 patients (age 75.3 ± 8.6 years, male gender 60.7%, median logistic EuroSCORE 20% [12; 31], functional mitral regurgitation (MR): 69.3%) were prospectively enrolled into the multicenter German Transcatheter Mitral Valve Interventions registry. Patients were stratified according to body mass index (BMI) into 4 groups: BMI <20 kg/m2 (underweight), BMI 20.0 to <25.0 kg/m2 (normal weight, reference group), BMI 25.0 to <30.0 kg/m2 (overweight) and BMI ≥30 kg/m2 (obese). Significant increased rates of procedural failure, transfusion/bleeding, sepsis or multiorgan failure and low cardiac output failure were found for underweight patients only. Kaplan-Meier survival curves demonstrated inferior survival for underweight patients, but comparable outcomes for all other patients (global log rank test, P < .01). Multivariable Cox-regression analysis (adjusted for age, gender, creatinine ≥1.5 mg/dL, diabetes, left ventricular ejection fraction <30% and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) confirmed underweight (as compared to normal weight) as an independent risk factor of death (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.58, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01-2.46, P = .044) and overweight as protective against death (HR: 0.71; 95%-CI: 0.55-0.93; P = .011). CONCLUSIONS: Compared to other weight groups, underweight patients undergoing MitraClip implantation are exposed to increased rates of procedural failure, bleeding and low cardiac output as well as increased short- and long-term mortality rates and should therefore be carefully discussed in the heart-team.

Predictors of ischemic mitral regurgitation improvement after surgical revascularization plus mitral valve repair for moderate ischemic mitral regurgitation.  ;"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Ischemic mitral regurgitation (IMR) recurrence after combined coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and mitral valve repair does occur, with a prevalence of 20% to 30% at the 2- to 4-year follow-up. This single-center study aims to identify the predictors of IMR improvement after surgical revascularization plus mitral valve repair for moderate IMR. METHODS: A total of 201 eligible patients were entered into an improved group (n = 141) or a control group (n = 60) according to whether moderate or more mitral regurgitation occurred at the 2-year postoperative time point. Clinical outcomes between groups were compared. RESULTS: The left ventricular endo-diastolic diameter (LVEDD), type of ring (rigid complete ring), and the use of repair techniques (restrictive annuloplasty associated with subvalvular and/or leaflet repair) were three predictors of IMR improvement after surgery (odds ratio [OR] = 0.921, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.865-0.976, P = .025; OR = 7.753, 95% CI, 3.168-17.742, P < .001; and OR = 0.168, 95% CI, 0.076-0.423, P = .004, respectively). The cutoff value of the LVEDD was 65 mm with a sensitivity of 80.0% and a specificity of 65.2%. Patients in the improved group compared with those in the control group demonstrated better cumulative survival during a median follow-up of 41.0 months (χ2  = 4.559, logrank P = .033) and a reduced ratio of the New York Heart Association class III-IV at the latest follow-up (5.7% vs 38.4%, P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: An LVEDD of less than 65 mm, the use of a rigid complete ring, and combined restrictive annuloplasty and subvalvular and/or leaflet repair are associated with IMR improvement after CABG plus mitral valve repair for the treatment of moderate IMR; IMR improvement 2 years after surgery is associated with improved midterm outcomes.

Cardiac magnetic resonance assessment of mitral regurgitation severity appears better than echocardiographic imaging.  ;The mitral valve surgery decision is made mainly according to echocardiographic (ECHO) criteria. As the asymptomatic patients are still candidates for surgery in some situations, this makes the accurate assessment of mitral regurgitation (MR) severity and cardiac dimensions even more important. We aimed to compare ECHO and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) in the assessment of MR severity and cardiac dimensions. In this prospective study, we included all patients with more than mild MR by ECHO and referred to our university hospital from 1st of April 2017 and 1st of April 2019. Exclusion criteria were critically ill patients, presence of other valve lesions, planned revascularization, pregnancy and contraindication for CMR. All patients had full history taking, examination, body surface area, and ECG. MR severity and left atrial and left ventricular dimensions were assessed in 50 patients with both 2D-ECHO and CMR in the same day. There were no significant differences in baseline clinical characteristics between moderate (24 patients) and severe MR (26 patients) groups. Poor degree of agreement was present between CMR and ECHO assessment for MR severity (same degree of MR only in 36% (18/50 patients) with kappa grade = 0.19). Furthermore, ECHO overestimated grades of MR compared to CMR (severe MR in 52% vs. 38.4%, p = 0.01 respectively). Based on the etiology of MR, primary (30 patients) vs. secondary MR (20 patients) showed the same dis-agreement between CMR and ECHO assessment of MR severity. Left atrial and ventricular dimensions showed good agreement between CMR and ECHO. Our results suggest that CMR could be more accurate than ECHO in assessing the severity of MR especially in severe cases that need surgery.  
Changes in inflammatory and vasoactive mediator profiles during valvular surgery with or without infective endocarditis: A case control pilot study.  ;"BACKGROUND: More than 50% of patients with infective endocarditis (IE) develop an indication for surgery. Despite its benefit, surgery is associated with a high incidence of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and mortality, which may be linked to increased release of inflammatory mediators during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). We therefore assessed plasma cytokine profiles in patients undergoing valve surgery with or without IE. METHODS: We performed a prospective case-control pilot study comparing patients undergoing cardiac valve surgery with or without IE. Plasma profiles of inflammatory mediators were measured at 7 defined time points and reported as median (interquartile). The degree of MODS was measured using sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score. RESULTS: Between May and December 2016 we included 40 patients (20 in each group). Both groups showed similar distribution of age and gender. Patients with IE had higher preoperative SOFA (6.9± 2.6 vs 3.8 ± 1.1, p<0.001) and operative risk scores (EuroSCORE II 18.6±17.4 vs. 1.8±1.3, p<0.001). In-hospital mortality was higher in IE patients (35% vs. 5%; p<0.001). Multiple organ failure was the cause of death in all non-survivors. At the end of CPB, median levels of following inflammatory mediators were higher in IE compared to control group: IL-6 (119.73 (226.49) vs. 24.48 (40.09) pg/ml, p = 0.001); IL-18 (104.82 (105.99) vs. 57.30 (49.53) pg/ml, p<0.001); Mid-regional pro-adrenomedullin (MR-proADM) (2.06 (1.58) vs. 1.11 (0.53) nmol/L, p = 0.003); MR- pro-atrial natriuretic peptide (MR-proANP) (479.49 (224.74) vs. 266.55 (308.26) pmol/l, p = 0.028). IL-1β and TNF- α were only detectable in IE patients and first after starting CPB. Plasma levels of IL-6, IL-18, MRproADM, and MRproANP during CPB were significantly lower in survivors than in those who died. CONCLUSION: The presence of infective endocarditis during cardiac valve surgery is associated with increased inflammatory response as evident by higher plasma cytokine levels and other inflammatory mediators. Actively reducing inflammatory response appears to be a plausible therapeutic concept. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, ID: NCT02727413.  "
Aortic Reconstruction by Cadaveric Graft After Radical Resection of Recurrent Retroperitoneal Leyomiosarcoma - A Case Report and Literature Review.  ;"BACKGROUND/AIM: Retroperitoneal sarcomas represent very aggressive malignancies with high capacity of invading the surrounding vital structures. CASE REPORT: We present the case of a 46-year-old patient who had been initially diagnosed with a large retroperitoneal mass 18 months ago. At that moment the mass was resected en bloc with the inferior cava vein, which was reconstructed using a cadaveric graft, the histopathological studies demonstrating the presence of a leiomyosarcoma. One year later she was diagnosed with recurrent disease invading the abdominal aorta and a liver metastasis. This time the recurrence was resected en bloc with the abdominal aorta, which was reconstructed by placing a cadaveric graft; atypical liver resection was also performed. The postoperative course was uneventful. CONCLUSION: Extended vascular resections and cadaveric graft reconstructions might be needed in order to achieve a good local control of the disease in patients with retroperitoneal sarcomas.  "

Elevated antistreptolysin O titer is closely related to cardiac mitral insufficiency in untreated patients with Takayasu arteritis.  ;"BACKGROUND: The etiology of Takayasu arteritis (TA) is unknown; however, a possible relationship between streptococcal infection and TA has been proposed. This study aimed to identify the clinical features and cardiac valvular involvement in untreated TA patients with an elevated antistreptolysin O (ASO) titer. METHODS: In this retrospective study, the clinical characteristics and features of valvular involvement were compared in TA patients with or without an elevated ASO titer. RESULTS: Of the 74 untreated TA patients, 13 patients were found have elevated ASO titers (17.6%). Mitral insufficiency was the most common in patients with elevated ASO (69.2%, 9/13), followed by aortic valve insufficiency (46.2%, 5/13) and tricuspid insufficiency (46.2%, 5/13), which were no significantly different than that in normal ASO group. The proportions of moderate to severe mitral (30.8% vs 1.6%, p = 0.000) and tricuspid valve (15.4% vs 1.64%, p = 0.023) insufficiency in the ASO positive group were significantly higher than those in the ASO negative group. The odds of mitral regurgitation in patients with elevated ASO titers were 3.9 times higher than those in the group with normal ASO titers (p = 0.053, OR = 3.929, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.983-15.694). Furthermore, the risk of moderate to severe mitral insufficiency in patients with elevated ASO titers was 41.6 times higher than that in patients with normal ASO titers (p = 0.002, OR = 41.600, 95% CI: 3.867-447.559). CONCLUSIONS: An increase in ASO titer is related to valvular involvement in TA and is closely linked to mitral insufficiency.  "
Sex differences in the evolution of left ventricle remodeling in rats with severe volume overload.  ;"BACKGROUND: Aortic valve regurgitation (AR) results in left ventricle (LV) volume overload (VO) leading to its dilation and hypertrophy (H). We study a rat model of severe AR induced by puncturing one or two leaflets using a catheter. Most of our studies were conducted in male animals. Recently, we started investigating if sex dimorphism existed in the AR rat model. We observed that AR females developed as much LVH as males but morphological remodeling differences were present. A head-to-head comparison of LV morphological and functional changes had never been performed in AR males (M) and females (F) using the latest modalities in cardiac imaging by echocardiography. METHODS: We performed a longitudinal study to evaluate the development of LV hypertrophy caused by chronic AR in male and female rats over 6 months. Sham-operated (sham) animals were used as controls. RESULTS: LV diastolic volumes (EDV) increased more over 6 months in sham males than in females (38% vs. 23% for EDV, both p < 0.01). AR resulted in significant LV dilation for both sexes (54% vs. 51% increase in EDV) vs. baseline values. Since normal cardiac growth was less in females, dilation from AR was relatively more important for them (88% (M) vs. 157% (F) increase in EDV over sham). AR caused LV wall thickening in both males and females. It happened sooner for AR females and was more important than in males (25% (M) vs. 56% (F) increase in septum thickness at 2 months and 10% (M) vs. 30% (F) at 6 months). We then evaluated if AR was associated with changes in LV strain using speckle-tracking 2D echocardiography. Global longitudinal strain remained similar between AR and sham animals. Circumferential strain was negatively modulated by AR but only in females and early after VO induction (13% (M) vs. 26% (F)). CONCLUSION: AR resulted in more LV dilation and quicker wall thickening in female AR rats compared to males. Global circumferential strain was negatively modulated in AR females but not in males. AR also seemed to lead to a more spherical LV shape in females whereas; it kept mostly an ellipsoid shape in males. This can influence validity of mass estimation of the dilated LV in females by echocardiography.  "
Association Between Homocysteine and Vascular Calcification Incidence, Prevalence, and Progression in the MESA Cohort.  ;Background While elevated homocysteine has been associated with calcification in several studies, its importance as a cardiovascular risk factor remains unclear. This study examines the relationship between homocysteine and vascular and valve calcification in the MESA (Multi-ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) cohort. Methods and Results MESA participants with baseline homocysteine measurements and cardiac computed tomography scans were included (N=6789). Baseline and follow-up assessment of vascular (coronary artery [CAC], descending thoracic aorta [DTAC]) and valve (aortic valve [AVC], mitral annular [MAC]) calcification was performed. Prevalence ratio/relative risk regression was used to assess the relationship of homocysteine with prevalent and incident calcification, and multivariable logistic regression was used to assess associations between homocysteine and calcification progression. Elevated homocysteine was associated with greater relative risk of prevalent and incident CAC and incident DTAC. We also identified a strong association between elevated homocysteine and CAC and DTAC progression. Elevated homocysteine was found to confer a >2-fold increased risk of severe CAC progression (defined as ΔCAC ≥100/year) and an ≈1.5-fold increased risk for severe DTAC progression (defined as ΔDTAC ≥100/year). Conclusions To our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating an association between elevated homocysteine and both incidence and progression of coronary and extra-coronary vascular calcification. Our findings suggest a potential role for elevated homocysteine as a risk factor for severe vascular calcification progression. Future studies are warranted to further assess the utility of homocysteine as a biomarker for vascular calcification incidence and progression.

Role of computed tomography in transcatheter aortic valve implantation and valve-in-valve implantation: complete review of preprocedural and postprocedural imaging.  ;: Since 2002, transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has revolutionized the treatment and prognosis of patients with aortic stenosis. A preprocedural assessment of the patient is vital for achieving optimal outcomes from the procedure. Retrospective ECG-gated cardiac computed tomography (CT) today it is the gold-standard imaging technique that provides three-dimensional images of the heart, thus allowing a rapid and complete evaluation of the morphology of the valve, ascending aorta, coronary arteries, peripheral access vessels, and prognostic factors, and also provides preprocedural coplanar fluoroscopic angle prediction to obtain complete assessment of the patient. The most relevant dimension in preprocedural planning of TAVI is the aortic annulus, which can determine the choice of prosthesis size. CT is also essential to identify patients with increased anatomical risk for coronary artery occlusion in Valve in Valve (ViV) procedures.Moreover, CT is very useful in the evaluation of late complications, such as leakage, thrombosis and displacements. At present, CT is the cornerstone imaging modality for the extensive and thorough work-up required for planning and performing each TAVI procedure, to achieve optimal outcomes. Both the CT procedure and analysis should be performed by trained and experienced personnel, with a radiological background and a deep understanding of the TAVI procedure, in close collaboration with the implantation team. An accurate pre-TAVI CT and post-processing for the evaluation of all the points recommended in this review allow a complete planning for the choice of the valve dimensions and type (balloon or self-expandable) and of the best percutaneous access.  
Pulmonary intimal sarcoma involving the pulmonary valve and right ventricular outflow tract: A case report and literature review.  ;INTRODUCTION: Pulmonary artery intimal sarcoma (PAIS) is a rare and highly aggressive tumor, and approximately 80% of pulmonary cases occur in the pulmonary trunk. We report herein a case of retrograde extension of the sarcoma to the pulmonary valve and right ventricle, which is an uncommon manifestation of this lethal tumor. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 41-year-old woman was initially diagnosed with pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) and transferred to our hospital. DIAGNOSIS: Computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) showed that there are low-density filling defects in both pulmonary arteries, and the patient was diagnosed with PTE. However, the ultrasonographers considered that the lesion is a space-occupying type that involves the right ventricular outflow tract and pulmonary valve instead of PTE. Postoperative pathology confirmed the diagnosis of PAIS. INTERVENTIONS: The patient underwent resection of pulmonary artery sarcoma and endarterectomy. OUTCOMES: During the follow-up via telephone 1 month after discharge, the patient reported to have been feeling well. CONCLUSION: Owing to the rarity of the disease and its non-specific clinical manifestations, approximately half of the PAIS cases are misdiagnosed or have a delayed diagnosis. Thus, improving our understanding of the disease and facilitating its early diagnosis are essential.  
Renal hemosiderosis secondary to intravascular hemolysis after mitral valve repair: A case report.  ;RATIONALE: Renal hemosiderosis is a disease in which hemosiderin deposits in the renal cortex as a form of iron overload. However, cases of renal hemosiderosis due to intravascular hemolysis following mitral valve repair have been rarely reported. PATIENT CONCERNS: We present the case of a 62-year-old woman who developed asymptomatic urinary abnormalities including microscopic hematuria and proteinuria due to renal hemosiderosis following a mitral valve repair surgery performed two years earlier. DIAGNOSES: A percutaneous renal biopsy showed no specific glomerular abnormality, tubular atrophy, or interstitial fibrosis but extensive deposition of hemosiderin in the proximal tubule. The patient was diagnosed with renal hemosiderosis and chronic intravascular hemolysis following mitral valve repair. INTERVENTIONS: Our patient refused a mitral valve repeat surgery and hence was treated with oral iron preparations, N-acetylcysteine, and a β-receptor blocker. OUTCOMES: Moderate mitral regurgitation with the regurgitant blood striking against the annuloplasty ring was confirmed on follow-up echocardiography. After the 24-month follow-up period, hemolytic anemia persisted, but there was no significant decline of renal function. LESSONS: For cases of chronic intravascular hemolysis accompanied with asymptomatic urinary abnormalities, a renal biopsy is required to exclude underlying kidney pathology and predict potential renal insufficiency.

Long-term follow-up of patients with contained annulus ruptures after TAVI: the EuropeaN COntained RupturE (ENCORE) registry.  ;"AIMS: The purpose of this registry was to determine the long-term outcomes in patients with asymptomatic contained annulus rupture (CR) as a rare complication of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). METHODS AND RESULTS: The ENCORE registry is a multicentre registry (six centres across Europe) of patients with CR diagnosed on post-TAVI computed tomography angiography (CTA) or transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE). A total of 21 patients (mean age 81.9±4.1 years, 81% balloon-expandable TAVI prostheses) were diagnosed with CR (mean size of lesions was 15.3±6.9 × 8.5±3.3 × 8.5±2.3 mm). Seventeen were diagnosed among a total of 1,602 consecutive routine post-TAVI CTA (incidence 1.1%), two in TEE and two in post-TAVI CTA (each conducted due to suspicion of peri-interventional complications). During a mean follow-up of 2.3±1.7 years (cumulative 48.6 patient-years), nine patients (43%) died from non-cardiac causes. None of the patients exhibited symptoms or underwent interventional treatment related to the CR; no sudden cardiac death occurred. A follow-up CTA, performed in eleven patients 240±176 days post TAVI, revealed stable CR findings in seven, regression in one, and remission in three patients. CONCLUSIONS: The results of our international multicentre registry demonstrate favourable long-term outcomes of CR after TAVI supporting a watch-and-wait strategy in these patients.  "

Educational inequality in patient-reported outcomes but not mortality among cardiac patients: Results from the national DenHeart survey with register follow-up.  ;Aims: This study aimed to explore whether educational level is associated with mental and physical health status, anxiety and depression symptoms and quality of life at hospital discharge and predicts cardiac events and all-cause mortality 1 year after hospital discharge in patients with ischaemic heart disease, arrhythmias, heart failure or heart valve disease. Methods: The DenHeart survey is cross-sectional and combined with data from national registers. Information on educational level and co-morbidity at hospital discharge and cardiac events and mortality 1-year post-discharge was obtained from registers. Patient-reported outcomes included SF-12, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and HeartQoL. Multivariate linear and logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards regression models were used. Results: A total of 13,145 patients were included. A significant educational gradient was found in patient-reported mental and physical health status, anxiety and depression symptoms and quality of life, with lower educational groups reporting worse outcomes in adjusted analyses. No association was found between educational level and risk of cardiac events or all-cause mortality within 1 year after hospital discharge in adjusted analyses. Conclusions: In a large population of patients with cardiac disease a significant educational gradient was found in mental and physical health and quality of life at hospital discharge. There was, however, no association between educational level and risk of cardiac events or mortality 1 year after hospital discharge.  
A novel 3D-Printed preferential posterior mitral annular dilation device delineates regurgitation onset threshold in an ex vivo heart simulator.  ;"Mitral regurgitation (MR) due to annular dilation occurs in a variety of mitral valve diseases and is observed in many patients with heart failure due to mitral regurgitation. To understand the biomechanics of MR and ultimately design an optimized annuloplasty ring, a representative disease model with asymmetric dilation of the mitral annulus is needed. This work shows the design and implementation of a 3D-printed valve dilation device to preferentially dilate the posterior mitral valve annulus. Porcine mitral valves (n = 3) were sewn into the device and mounted within a left heart simulator that generates physiologic pressures and flows through the valves, while chordal forces were measured. The valves were incrementally dilated, inducing MR, while hemodynamic and force data were collected. Flow analysis demonstrated that MR increased linearly with respect to percent annular dilation when dilation was greater than a 25.6% dilation threshold (p < 0.01). Pre-threshold, dilation did not cause significant increases in regurgitant fraction. Forces on the chordae tendineae increased as dilation increased prior to the identified threshold (p < 0.01); post-threshold, the MR resulted in highly variable forces. Ultimately, this novel dilation device can be used to more accurately model a wide range of MR disease states and their corresponding repair techniques using ex vivo experimentation. In particular, this annular dilation device provides the means to investigate the design and optimization of novel annuloplasty rings.  "
Mass spectrometric investigation of cardiolipins and their oxidation products after two-dimensional heart-cut liquid chromatography.  ;The anionic phospholipid class of cardiolipins (CL) is increasingly attracting scientific attention in the recent years. CL can be found as a functional component of mitochondrial membranes in almost all living organisms. Changes in the CL composition are favored by oxidative stress. Based on this finding, the investigation of CL and their oxidation products in relation to various disease patterns, including neurodegenerative ones, is moving into the focus of current research. The analysis of this diverse lipid class is still challenging and requires sensitive and selective methods. In this work, we demonstrate an online two-dimensional liquid chromatography (2D-LC) approach by means of a heart-cut setup. In the first dimension, a fast hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) method was developed for the separation of CL and their oxidation products from other phospholipid classes, but more important from nonpolar lipid classes, such as triacylglycerol and cholesterol. Those classes can negatively affect the electrospray ionization and also the chromatography. For the heart-cut approach, the CL fraction was selectively transferred to a loop using a six-port valve followed by the transfer to a reversed phase (RP) column in second dimension. On the RP column, the transferred CL fraction including the oxidation products were separated according to the hydrophobicity of acyl chain moieties. Matrix effects were significantly reduced compared to the one-dimensional LC-MS method. In addition, the total separation time had not to be prolonged by shifting the equilibration step of the RP column parallel to the separation in first dimension. The heart-cut LC-LC approach was applied to artificially oxidized lipid extracts of bovine heart and yeast by means of Fenton reaction. In summary, 42 species have been identified by high resolution mass spectrometry and database matching. 31 species thereof have been further characterized by MS/MS experiments.  
Perioperative Management of Patients with Sepsis and Septic Shock, Part II: Ultrasound Support for Resuscitation.  ;"Point-of-care ultrasound is capable of identifying the precise causes of hemodynamic failure in patients with septic shock. Patients in shock demonstrate complex alterations in their circulation, including changes in loading conditions (preload and afterload), right and left ventricular function, and development of obstructive physiology, and some of them have a burden of underlying cardiac disease. Knowledge of underlying hemodynamic derangements in such situations allows targeted interventions, that is, fluids, vasoactive, and inotropic medications, to optimize patient's perfusion. One example of competing goals involves a patient with hypertrophic ""thick"" left ventricle (LV), which is easily identified using point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS). Such patients usually have diastolic dysfunction and commonly require higher filling pressures (mainly grade II and III diastolic dysfunction) to maintain adequate cardiac output. They are vulnerable to the effects of hypovolemia with the potential for dynamic LV outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction. The use of inotrope is harmful under these circumstances and could lead to worsening of the obstructive physiology because of systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve leaflet and mitral regurgitation with rapid progression toward a cardiac arrest. Recognizing the increasingly important role of POCUS in the perioperative arena, in this review, we highlight how POCUS allows anesthesiologists to recognize and manage hemodynamic derangements in patients with sepsis and septic shock. We provide a systematic approach to the evaluation of this patient population using qualitative assessment of myocardial performance, fluid responsiveness, and fluid tolerance. Our approach is based on a limited number of ultrasound views: subcostal, inferior vena cava (IVC), and lung views are obtained in rapid succession. A combination of findings in these views is grouped into distinct hemodynamic phenotypes, each of them requiring their own approach to management.  "
Impact of Septal Myectomy Volume on Mitral-Valve Replacement Rate in Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Patients.  ;OBJECTIVE: Mitral regurgitation (MR) induced by systolic anterior motion in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) can frequently be abolished with a proficient septal myectomy (SM) without the need for mitral-valve replacement (MVR). ACC guidelines stress the importance of volume in improving outcomes after SM, but there is a lack of data measuring the impact of volume on the need for MVR during SM. This study was designed to assess the impact of institutional volume on MVR rates using national outcomes data. METHODS: The Nationwide Inpatient Sample was queried from 1998 to 2011 and a total of 6,207 patients had a diagnosis of HCM and a procedure code for SM. Outcomes were compared between patients who underwent SM (group I) and SM and MVR (group II). Furthermore, patients were stratified into 3 groups based on the number of SMs at the performing institution: low experience (1-24 cumulative SMs), medium experience (25-49 SMs), and high experience (>50 SMs). These patients underwent multivariable analysis to determine the impact of institutional volume on MVR rate. RESULTS: The total MVR rate was 26%. Perioperative outcomes were worse, i.e., there were higher rates of mortality, kidney injury, and urinary complications, in group II than in group I. Only 37.6% of patients were operated on at institutions meeting the guideline criteria of >50 cumulative SMs. When compared to patients in the high-experience group, patients in the low- (OR 2.7, 95% CI 2.3-3.2, p < 0.05) and medium-experience (OR 3.0, 95% CI 2.5-3.6, p < 0.05) groups were more likely to undergo MVR. CONCLUSION: Compared to reports from SM reference centers, national data suggest that MVR rates are quite high at SM. Patients undergoing SM at centers that do not meet the guideline standard have >2.5× the odds of undergoing MVR compared to those operated on at guideline-endorsed centers.  
Circulating follicular T helper cells and humoral reactivity in rheumatic heart disease.  ;"AIMS: This study aimed to profile circulating T follicular helper cells (cTfh) and their effect on B cells in rheumatic heart disease (RHD). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Participants were divided into healthy control (HC, n = 30) and RHD (n = 30) groups. Percentages of cTfh subpopulations, based on CD4, CXCR5, CXCR3, CCR6, Foxp3, Ki67, and PD-1 cell markers, and of CD19+ B cell subgroups were measured by flow cytometry and compared between the groups. Also, IL-21 concentration in plasma and mitral valve were quantitated by cytometric bead array, immunofluorescence, and western blotting. KEY FINDINGS: The PD-1+ cTfh, B cells (naive B cells, plasmablasts, and plasma B cells) proportion and cTfh17/cTfh ratios in RHD group were significantly increased, compared to HC (p < 0.01 in all cases), while different types of memory B cells were diminished (p < 0.001). In RHD patients, percentages of PD-1+ cTfh and switched memory B cells were negatively correlated (r = -0.565, p = 0.009); meanwhile, percentages of plasmablasts and PD-1+ cTfh cells were positively correlated (r = 0.594, p = 0.005). Additionally, IL-21 levels in plasma and mitral valve of RHD group were higher than those in HC. Also, IL-21 levels correlated with PD-1+ cTfh(r = 0.557, p = 0.010), cTfh17 (r = 0.567, p = 0.009), and plasmablast (r = -0.5957, p = 0.005) cell proportions, and (cTh2 + cTh17)/cTfh1 ratio (r = -0.547, p = 0.013). SIGNIFICANCE: The activation of PD-1+ cTfh and cTfh17 subtype was highly correlated with plasmablast maturation and IL-21 production in rheumatic heart disease. Thus indicating the prominent role of cTfh and humoral reactivity in the immune pathogenesis of RHD.  "

Comparative pathology of human and canine myxomatous mitral valve degeneration: 5HT and TGF-β mechanisms.  ;Myxomatous mitral valve degeneration (MMVD) is a leading cause of valve repair or replacement secondary to the production of mitral regurgitation, cardiac enlargement, systolic dysfunction, and heart failure. The pathophysiology of myxomatous mitral valve degeneration is complex and incompletely understood, but key features include activation and transformation of mitral valve (MV) valvular interstitial cells (VICs) into an active phenotype leading to remodeling of the extracellular matrix and compromise of the structural components of the mitral valve leaflets. Uncovering the mechanisms behind these events offers the potential for therapies to prevent, delay, or reverse myxomatous mitral valve degeneration. One such mechanism involves the neurotransmitter serotonin (5HT), which has been linked to development of valvulopathy in a variety of settings, including valvulopathy induced by serotonergic drugs, Serotonin-producing carcinoid tumors, and development of valvulopathy in laboratory animals exposed to high levels of serotonin. Similar to humans, the domestic dog also experiences naturally occurring myxomatous mitral valve degeneration, and in some breeds of dogs, the lifetime prevalence of myxomatous mitral valve degeneration reaches 100%. In dogs, myxomatous mitral valve degeneration has been associated with high serum serotonin, increased expression of serotonin-receptors, autocrine production of serotonin within the mitral valve leaflets, and downregulation of serotonin clearance mechanisms. One pathway closely associated with serotonin involves transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) and the two pathways share a common ability to activate mitral valve valvular interstitial cells in both humans and dogs. Understanding the role of serotonin and transforming growth factor beta in myxomatous mitral valve degeneration gives rise to potential therapies, such as 5HT receptor (5HT-R) antagonists. The main purposes of this review are to highlight the commonalities between myxomatous mitral valve degeneration in humans and dogs, with specific regards to serotonin and transforming growth factor beta, and to champion the dog as a relevant and particularly valuable model of human disease that can accelerate development of novel therapies.  
Mechanics of Porcine Heart Valves' Strut Chordae Tendineae Investigated as a Leaflet-Chordae-Papillary Muscle Entity.  ;Proper blood flow through the atrioventricular heart valves (AHVs) relies on the holistic function of the valve and subvalvular structures, and a failure of any component can lead to life-threatening heart disease. A comprehension of the mechanical characteristics of healthy valvular components is necessary for the refinement of heart valve computational models. In previous studies, the chordae tendineae have been mechanically characterized as individual structures, usually in a clamping-based approach, which may not accurately reflect the in vivo chordal interactions with the leaflet insertion and papillary muscles. In this study, we performed uniaxial mechanical testing of strut chordae tendineae of the AHVs under a unique tine-based leaflet-chordae-papillary muscle testing to observe the chordae mechanics while preserving the subvalvular component interactions. Results of this study provided insight to the disparity of chordae tissue stress-stretch responses between the mitral valve (MV) and the tricuspid valve (TV) under their respective emulated physiological loading. Specifically, strut chordae tendineae of the MV anterior leaflet had peak stretches of 1.09-1.16, while peak stretches of 1.08-1.11 were found for the TV anterior leaflet strut chordae. Constitutive parameters were also derived for the chordae tissue specimens using an Ogden model, which is useful for AHV computational model refinement. Results of this study are beneficial to the eventual improvement of treatment methods for valvular disease.  
Sequential Use of Alcohol Septal Ablation and Electrosurgical Leaflet Resection Prior to Transcatheter Mitral Valve Replacement.  ;"In patients with increased surgical risk and hemodynamically significant mitral disease, a transcatheter strategy for mitral valve replacement (TMVR) may be suitable; however, is also not without procedure risk. Obstruction of the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) is one of the most dreaded complications of TMVR, requiring careful consideration of potential candidates with preprocedural imaging and ex vivo valvular fit simulation as part of risk assessment for postprocedure obstruction. In patients at high risk of LVOT obstruction, early studies have shown that alcohol septal ablation or electrosurgical laceration of the anterior mitral leaflet (LAMPOON) procedure prior to TMVR may mitigate the risk of LVOT obstruction. We describe the recent successful management of a patient with severe mitral valve disease, mitral annular calcification (MAC), and high risk of post-TMVR LVOT obstruction, who underwent a sequential strategy of ASA followed by electrosurgical leaflet resection with the LAMPOON procedure prior to TMVR to successfully prevent LVOT obstruction. To our knowledge, this is the first time this dual strategy has been reported, and it may allow more patients with severe mitral valve disease to undergo TMVR in the future.  "
Late onset of new conduction disturbances requiring permanent pacemaker implantation following TAVI.  ;BACKGROUND: The timing of onset and associated predictors of late new conduction disturbances (CDs) leading to permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI) following transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) are still unknown, however, essential for an early and safe discharge. This study aimed to investigate the timing of onset and associated predictors of late onset CDs in patients requiring PPI (LCP) following TAVI. METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from five large volume centres in Europe. Post-TAVI electrocardiograms and telemetry data were evaluated in patients with a PPI post-TAVI to identify the onset of new advanced CDs. Early onset CDs were defined as within 48 hours after procedure, and late onset CDs as after 48 hours. A total of 2804 patients were included for analysis. The PPI rate was 12%, of which 18% was due to late onset CDs (>48 hours). Independent predictors for LCP were pre-existing non-specific intraventricular conduction delay, pre-existing right bundle branch block, self-expandable valves and predilation. At least one of these risk factors was present in 98% of patients with LCP. Patients with a balloon-expandable valve without predilation did not develop CDs requiring PPI after 48 hours. CONCLUSIONS: Safe early discharge might be feasible in patients without CDs in the first 48 hours after TAVI if no risk factors for LCP are present.  
Value of Transvalvular Flow Rate during Exercise in Asymptomatic Patients with Aortic Stenosis.  ;"BACKGROUND: The optimal management of asymptomatic aortic stenosis (AS) remains controversial. Although exercise stress echocardiography (ESE) has been applied to nonischemic heart disease, the evidence of the prognostic value for asymptomatic AS has been limited. This study aimed to investigate the value of ESE in patients with asymptomatic AS. METHODS: This retrospective observational study included consecutive asymptomatic patients with at least moderate AS (mean pressure gradient ≥ 20 mm Hg or aortic valve area < 1.5 cm2) and preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (≥50%) who underwent ESE. Of these, 10 patients who were referred for aortic valve replacement without symptoms were excluded. A final 99 conservatively managed patients (73 ± 13 years; 54% male) were enrolled in this study. All patients were followed for AS-related events. RESULTS: During the mean follow-up period of 14 ± 11 months, 23 patients underwent from AS-related events. Although no differences were found between the patients with and without adverse events in terms of mean pressure gradient during exercise, the transvalvular flow rate during exercise (Ex-FR) was lower in the patients who experienced adverse events (236 ± 55 vs 274 ± 64 mL/sec, P = .01). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed a decrease in Ex-FR (<270 mL/sec) independently associated with adverse events in patients with asymptomatic AS (hazard ratio = 3.53, P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: The result of the present study suggests that Ex-FR measured by ESE could play a crucial role in the risk stratification of patients with asymptomatic AS.  "
A novel in vivo assessment of fluid dynamics on aortic valve leaflet using epi-aortic echocardiogram.  ;BACKGROUND: Mechanical stress caused by blood flow, such as wall shear stress (WSS) and its related parameters, is key moderator of endothelial degeneration. However, an in vivo method to measure WSS on heart valves has not been developed. METHODS: We developed a novel approach, based on vector flow mapping using intraoperative epi-aortic echocardiogram, to measure WSS and oscillatory shear index (OSI) on the aortic valve. We prospectively enrolled 15 patients with normal valves, who underwent coronary artery bypass graft. RESULTS: Systolic WSS on the ventricularis (2.40 ± 0.44 Pa [1.45-3.00 Pa]) was higher than systolic WSS on the fibrosa (0.33 ± 0.08 Pa [0.14-0.47 Pa], P < .001) and diastolic WSS on the ventricularis (0.18 ± 0.07 Pa [0.04-0.28 Pa], P < .001). Oscillatory shear index on the fibrosa was higher than on the ventricularis (0.29 ± 0.04 [0.24-0.36] vs 0.05 ± 0.03 [0.01-0.12], P < .001). A pilot study involving two patients with severe aortic regurgitation showed significantly different values in fluid dynamics. CONCLUSION: Vector flow mapping method using intraoperative epi-aortic echocardiogram is an effective way of measuring WSS and OSI on normal aortic leaflet in vivo, allowing for better understanding of the pathophysiology of aortic valve diseases.  
Studying Xenograft Rejection of Bioprosthetic Heart Valves.  ;"Millions of patients with valvular heart disease have benefitted from heart valve replacement since the procedure was first introduced in the 1960s; however, there are still many patients who get early structural valve deterioration (SVD) of their bioprosthetic heart valves (BHV). BHV are porcine, bovine, or equine tissues that have been glutaraldehyde fixed to preserve the tissue and presumably make the tissue immunologically inert. These glutaraldehyde-fixed BHV with anti-calcification treatments last long periods of time in older adults but develop early SVD in younger patients. The consensus at present is that the early SVD in younger patients is due to more ""wear and tear"" of the valves and higher calcium turnover in younger patients. However, as younger patients likely have a more robust immune system than older adults, there is a new hypothesis that BHV xenografts may undergo xenograft rejection, and this may contribute to the early SVD seen in younger patients.At present, the technology to noninvasively study in vivo whether an implanted BHV in a human patient is undergoing rejection is not available. Thus, a small animal discordant xenotransplant model in young rodents (to match the young patient getting a pig/bovine/equine BHV) was developed to study whether the hypothesis that glutaraldehyde-fixed BHV undergo xenograft rejection had any merit. In this chapter, we describe our model and its merits and the results of our investigations. Our work provides clear evidence of xenograft rejection in glutaraldehyde-fixed tissue, and our small animal model offers an opportunity to study this process in detail.  "
Association of AHSG gene polymorphisms with serum Fetuin-A levels in individuals with cardiovascular calcification in west of Iran.  ;Fetuin-A (AHSG) is a multifunctional secretory protein and acts as an ectopic valve and artery calcification inhibitor. We assessed the correlation between serum levels of Fetuin-A and both exon 6 (248 C/T) and exon 7 (256 C/G) mutations in patients with coronary artery calcification (CAC), mitral annular calcification (MAC), and aortic valve calcification (AVC). 184 patients and 184 healthy individuals as control group were included. The genetic variants of rs4917 and rs4918 for the AHSG gene were determined by PCR-RFLP and T-ARMS PCR techniques. Fetuin-A levels, fasting blood sugar (FBS), urea, creatinine, calcium phosphorus, and lipid profile were measured. Fetuin-A levels were remarkedly lower in individuals with AVC, MAC, and CAC comparing to the control group (p < 0.001). The CT + TT genotypes and the T allele (AHSG Thr248Met) were associated with the risk of calcification of heart valves and coronary artery by 1.31 and 1.27 times in the patient group, respectively. The frequency of CT genotype and T allele was considerably higher in the patient group comparing to the control group. Patients with T allele (CT + TT) had higher levels of FBS, urea, low-density lipoproteins (LDL)-C, phosphorus, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) while decreased levels of triglyceride, high-density lipoproteins (HDL)-C, calcium and fetuin-A in comparison to control group. Additionally, there was a positive correlation between serum FBS, urea, creatinine, HDL-C, calcium with fetuin-A, and a negative correlation between phosphorous level, SBP, and DBP with fetuin-A. T allele in rs4917 Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is the risk allele of calcification of heart valves and coronary arteries and fetuin-A levels correlates negatively with the occurrence of the disease.  
Rivaroxaban in patients undergoing surgical mitral valve repair.  ;"In patients undergoing mitral valve repair (MVre), a 3-month course of anticoagulation is currently recommended. The role of the non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants has here been scarcely studied. In the present mixed cohort study, the safety and efficacy of rivaroxaban (prospective analysis) were compared with those of warfarin (retrospective analysis) in patients undergoing MVre. Anticoagulation therapy was continued for at least 3 months, and the patients were followed for 1 year following surgery. The present study recruited 736 patients undergoing MVre with or without concomitant coronary artery bypass or surgical repair on the other valves. Concomitant valvular replacement and severe chronic kidney diseases were the most important exclusion criteria. The final analysis was conducted on 153 patients treated with rivaroxaban and 144 patients treated with warfarin. Dissimilarities in baseline characteristics necessitated propensity score matching, in which 104 patients in each group were compared. No major bleeding or cerebrovascular accident occurred during the 1-year follow-up. Clinically relevant non-major bleeding was reported in 2 patients in the rivaroxaban group and 4 patients in the warfarin group, a difference non-statistically significant before and after propensity score matching (P = 0.371 and P = 0.407, respectively). The type of anticoagulation did not predict the 1-year outcome (HR 2.165, 95% CI 0.376 to 12.460; P = 0.387). In this mixed cohort study, rivaroxaban was both safe and efficient in patients with MVre. Such preliminary results should prompt larger randomized controlled trials.  "
Shared decision making in older patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis: a systematic review.  ;"This review provides an overview of the status of shared decision making (SDM) in older patients regarding treatment of symptomatic severe aortic stenosis (SSAS). The databases Embase, Medline Ovid, Cinahl and Cochrane Dare were searched for relevant studies from January 2002 to May 2018 regarding perspectives of professionals, patients and caregivers; aspects of decision making; type of decision making; application of the six domains of SDM; barriers to and facilitators of SDM. The systematic search yielded 1842 articles, 15 studies were included. Experiences of professionals and informal caregivers with SDM were scarcely found. Patient refusal was a frequently reported result of decision making, but often no insight was given into the decision process. Most studies investigated the 'decision' and 'option' domains of SDM, yet no study took all six domains into account. Problem analysis, personalised treatment aims, use of decision aids and integrating patient goals in decisions lacked in all studies. Barriers to and facilitators of SDM were 'individualised formal and informal information support' and 'patients' opportunity to use their own knowledge about their health condition and preferences for SDM'. In conclusion, SDM is not yet common practice in the decision making process of older patients with SSAS. Moreover, the six domains of SDM are not often applied in this process. More knowledge is needed about the implementation of SDM in the context of SSAS treatment and how to involve patients, professionals and informal caregivers.  "
Microsurgical Trapping and Excision of Ruptured Mycotic Aneurysms in a Patient with Mitral Valve Endocarditis: A Surgical Technique.  ;This case Video 1 demonstrates a microsurgical technique for trapping and excision of 2 ruptured mycotic aneurysms. The patient was a 64-year-old man with severe mitral regurgitation and valvular vegetations suggestive of endocarditis. On examination, the patient presented with speech difficulty. Preoperative imaging showed a large left temporoparietal intracerebral hemorrhage and associated sulcal subarachnoid hemorrhage from 2 distal aneurysms of the left middle cerebral artery. In the presence of ruptured aneurysms in a patient who requires anticoagulation for valve replacement, endovascular options are limited. For aneurysms located in an eloquent area in the left hemisphere, microsurgical treatment with small corridors can facilitate excision and minimize damage to the surrounding tissue. As such, the patient was treated with microsurgical trapping and excision of the aneurysms followed by evacuation of intraparenchymal hemorrhage using stereotactic navigation. Intraoperative neurophysiologic monitoring was used to prepare for a potential bypass in the event of inadequate collaterals or changes in neurophysiologic potentials. Postoperatively, the patient remained symmetric in his motor strength and had improved speech deficits, indicative of an uneventful recovery. The patient was cleared for full anticoagulation and valve replacement on postoperative day 10. The patient underwent intravenous antibiotic therapy with ceftriaxone before undergoing mitral valve replacement by cardiac surgery.  
Bicuspid aortic valve sizing for transcatheter aortic valve implantation: Development and validation of an algorithm based on multi-slice computed tomography.  ;"BACKGROUND: No indication are available for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) sizing in bicuspid aortic valve (BAV). Aim of the study is to develop and validate a Multi-Slice Computed Tomography (MSCT)-based algorithm for transcatheter heart valve (THV) sizing in patients with stenotic BAV under evaluation for TAVI. METHODS: A two steps method was applied: 1)evaluation of a cohort of 19 consecutive patients with type I BAV stenosis undergoing TAVI through pre and post-procedural MSCT, and development of an algorithm for THV sizing; 2)validation of the algorithm on a new cohort of 21 patients. RESULTS: In the first cohort, a high correlation was found between the raphe-level area measured at pre-procedural MSCT and the smallest THV area measured at post-procedural MSCT (p < 0.001). Moreover, reduced THV expansion was observed among patients with higher calcium burden (p = 0.048). Then, a new algorithm for TAVI sizing in BAV was develop (CASPER: Calcium Algorithm Sizing for bicusPid Evaluation with Raphe). This algorithm is based on the reassessment of the perimeter/area derived annulus diameter, according to three main anatomical features: 1) the ratio between raphe length and annulus diameter; 2)calcium burden; 3)calcium distribution in relation to the raphe. The algorithm was then validated in a new cohort of 21 patients, achieving 100% of procedural success and excellent TAVI performance. CONCLUSION: MSCT assessment of raphe length, calcium burden and its distribution is of crucial relevance in the pre-procedural evaluation of patients with BAV. These anatomical features can be combined in a new and simple algorithm for TAVI sizing.  "

Combined one-stage minimally invasive surgery for primary pulmonary carcinoma and mitral regurgitation.  ;BACKGROUND: We report the first successful short-term outcome of one-stage minimally invasive surgery (MIS) mitral valve repair and video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) lobectomy. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the first successful short-term outcome of combined one-stage video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery lobectomy and minimally invasive surgery in a patient with operable primary right upper lobe adenocarcinoma and mitral regurgitation. Post- operative recovery was uneventful, and follow-up at 6 weeks confirmed an excellent surgical and oncologic outcome. CONCLUSIONS: We think one-stage minimally invasive surgery (MIS) cardiac surgery and video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) lobectomy would benefit patients with satisfactory cardiac and pulmonary function.  
Antioxidant defence and oxidative stress markers in cats with asymptomatic and symptomatic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: a pilot study.  ;"BACKGROUND: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is the most common cardiovascular cause of death in cats. Although the majority of cats remain asymptomatic, some may develop signs of chronic heart failure due to diastolic failure, arterial thromboembolism (ATE) or sudden cardiac death. Therefore, it is crucial to identify individuals that are in high risk of developing cardiac complications before the onset of life-threatening signs. Oxidative stress is the imbalance between the production and neutralisation of reactive oxygen species. Uncontrolled reactive oxygen species overproduction leads to protein and lipid peroxidation and damages the DNA strands, injuring the cells and leading to their death. The aim of the study was to evaluate the oxidative state in cats with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and healthy controls. RESULTS: In total, 30 cats divided into three groups were assessed: animals with clinically evident hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM; n = 8), subclinical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (SUB-HCM; n = 11) and healthy controls (n = 11). The activity of superoxide dismutase was statistically significantly lower in animals with symptomatic and asymptomatic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM 0.99 ± 0.35 U/mL; SUB-HCM 1.39 ± 0.4 U/mL) compared to healthy cats (2.07 ± 0.76 U/mL, p < 0.01). The activity of catalase was significantly lower in the SUB-HCM group (19.4 ± 4.2 nmol/min/mL) compared to the HCM (23.6 ± 5.9 nmol/min/mL) and the control (30 ± 7.5 nmol/min/mL, p < 0.01) group. The activity of glutathione peroxidase was 4196 ± 353 nmol/min/mL in the HCM group, 4331 ± 451 nmol/min/mL in the SUB-HCM group and 4037 ± 341 nmol/min/mL in the control group and did not differ significantly between groups. The total antioxidant capacity of plasma was 602 ± 65.5 copper reducing equivalents (CRE) in the HCM group, 605.9 ± 39.9 CRE in the SUB-HCM group and 629 ± 77.5 CRE in the healthy cats and did not differ significantly between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase differed in cats with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, however the activity of the latter was only significantly lower in asymptomatic stage of the disease. The potentially beneficial effect of antioxidative substances on the disease progression in the asymptomatic and symptomatic stage of this disease should also be examined.  "
Comparison of the effects of lanthanum carbonate and calcium carbonate on the progression of cardiac valvular calcification after initiation of hemodialysis.  ;"BACKGROUND: Although mineral metabolism disorder influences cardiac valvular calcification (CVC), few previous studies have examined the effects of non-calcium-containing and calcium-containing phosphate binders on CVC in maintenance hemodialysis patients. The aim of the present study was to compare the effects of lanthanum carbonate (LC) with calcium carbonate (CC) on the progression of CVC in patients who initiated maintenance hemodialysis and to investigate clinical factors related to CVC. METHODS: The current study included 50 subjects (mean age 65 years, 72% males) from our previous randomized controlled trial (LC group, N = 24; CC group, N = 26). CVC was evaluated as CVC score (CVCS) using echocardiography at baseline and 18 months after initiation of hemodialysis. We compared CVCS and the changes between the two groups. We also analyzed the associations between CVCS and any other clinical factors including arterial plaque score (PS) and serum phosphorus levels. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics of study participants including CVCS were almost comparable between the two groups. At 18 months, there were no significant differences in mineral metabolic markers or CVCS between the two groups, and CVCS were significantly correlated with PS (r = 0.39, p < 0.01). Furthermore, changes in CVCS were significantly correlated with average phosphorus levels (r = 0.36, p < 0.05), which were significantly higher in high serum phosphorus and high PS group compared to low serum phosphorus and low PS group (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, there were no significant differences between LC and CC with regard to progression of CVC. However, serum phosphorus levels and arterial plaque seem to be important for the progression and formation of CVC in hemodialysis patients.  "
Dissecting myocardial mechanics in patients with severe aortic stenosis: 2-dimensional vs 3-dimensional-speckle tracking echocardiography.  ;BACKGROUND: Aortic stenosis (AS) causes left ventricular (LV) pressure overload, leading to adverse LV remodeling and dysfunction. Identifying early subclinical markers of LV dysfunction in patients with significant AS is critical as this could provide support for earlier intervention, which may result in improved long-term outcomes. We therefore examined the impact of severe AS and its consequent increase in LV afterload on myocardial deformation and rotational mechanics by 2-dimensional (2D) and 3-dimensional (3D) speckle-tracking echocardiography. METHODS: We prospectively measured various strain parameters in 168 patients (42% female, mean age 72 ± 12 years) with severe AS and LV ejection fraction (EF) ≥50%, and compared them to normal values found in literature. 2D and 3D images were analyzed for global longitudinal strain (GLS), global circumferential strain (GCS), global radial strain (GRS), basal rotation, apical rotation, and peak systolic twist. We further assessed the degree of concordance between 2D and 3D strain, and examined their association with measures of LV preload and afterload. RESULTS: Patients with severe AS exhibited significantly lower GLS and GRS but higher GCS, apical rotation, and twist by 2D and 3D echocardiography compared with published normal values (P = 0.003 for 3D twist, P < 0.001 for all others). Agreement between 2D- and 3D-GLS by concordance correlation coefficient was 0.49 (95% confidence interval: 0.39-0.57). GLS was correlated with valvulo-arterial impedance, a measure of LV afterload (r = 0.34, p < 0.001 and r = 0.23, p = 0.003, respectively). CONCLUSION: Patients with severe AS demonstrated lower-than-normal GLS and GRS but appear to compensate with higher-than-normal GCS, apical rotation, and twist in order to maintain a preserved LVEF. GLS showed a modest correlation with valvulo-arterial impedance.  
Phylogenic Determinants of Cardiovascular Frailty, Focus on Hemodynamics and Arterial Smooth Muscle Cells.  ;The evolution of the circulatory system from invertebrates to mammals has involved the passage from an open system to a closed in-parallel system via a closed in-series system, accompanying the increasing complexity and efficiency of life's biological functions. The archaic heart enables pulsatile motion waves of hemolymph in invertebrates, and the in-series circulation in fish occurs with only an endothelium, whereas mural smooth muscle cells appear later. The present review focuses on evolution of the circulatory system. In particular, we address how and why this evolution took place from a closed, flowing, longitudinal conductance at low pressure to a flowing, highly pressurized and bifurcating arterial compartment. However, although arterial pressure was the latest acquired hemodynamic variable, the general teleonomy of the evolution of species is the differentiation of individual organ function, supported by specific fueling allowing and favoring partial metabolic autonomy. This was achieved via the establishment of an active contractile tone in resistance arteries, which permitted the regulation of blood supply to specific organ activities via its localized function-dependent inhibition (active vasodilation). The global resistance to viscous blood flow is the peripheral increase in frictional forces caused by the tonic change in arterial and arteriolar radius, which backscatter as systemic arterial blood pressure. Consequently, the arterial pressure gradient from circulating blood to the adventitial interstitium generates the unidirectional outward radial advective conductance of plasma solutes across the wall of conductance arteries. This hemodynamic evolution was accompanied by important changes in arterial wall structure, supported by smooth muscle cell functional plasticity, including contractility, matrix synthesis and proliferation, endocytosis and phagocytosis, etc. These adaptive phenotypic shifts are due to epigenetic regulation, mainly related to mechanotransduction. These paradigms actively participate in cardio-arterial pathologies such as atheroma, valve disease, heart failure, aneurysms, hypertension, and physiological aging.  
Emergency valve-in-valve transcatheter aortic valve implantation for endocarditis degeneration.  ;The use of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in the emergency setting has not been widely reported, and TAVI is generally contraindicated in the context of endocarditis. Here we describe a patient developing acute cardiogenic shock due to prosthetic aortic valve degeneration with free-flow aortic regurgitation 8 months after receiving treatment for confirmed infective endocarditis. Due to his clinical status, he was deemed unfit for redo surgery, and he underwent salvage valve-in-valve (ViV)-TAVI. The patient made an excellent recovery. Postprocedure he was treated with a 6-week course of antibiotics, and at 18-months follow-up remains very well with no evidence of reinfection. This case may demonstrate that for selected patients with degenerative prosthetic aortic valve disease, despite a history of infective endocarditis, ViV-TAVI may be considered an alternative to redo surgery in the emergency setting.  
Patient Disposition and Clinical Outcome After Referral to a Dedicated TAVI Clinic.  ;"Introduction: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is the standard of care for the majority of patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis (AS) at excessive-, high- and intermediate-surgical risk. A proportion of patients referred for TAVI do not undergo the procedure and proceed with an alternate treatment strategy. There is scarce data describing the final treatment allocation of such patients. Hence, we sought to evaluate the final treatment allocation of patients referred for TAVI in contemporary practice. Methods: We performed a single center prospective observational study, including all patients referred to our institution for treatment of severe aortic stenosis between February 2014 and August 2017. Baseline demographic and clinical data were recorded. Patients were categorized according to treatment allocation: TAVI, surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) or optimal medical therapy (OMT). Clinical outcomes were adjudicated according to VARC-2 definitions. All patients were discussed at a dedicated Heart Team meeting. Results: Total of 245 patients were referred for assessment to a dedicated TAVI clinic during the study period. Patients with moderate (N = 32; 13.1%) and asymptomatic (N = 31; 13.1%) AS were excluded. Subsequently, 53.9% (N = 132) received TAVI, 12.7% (N =31) were managed with OMT, and 7.3% (N =18) had SAVR. Reasons for OMT included primarily: patient's preference (N = 12; 38.7%); excessive surgical risk (N = 4; 12.9%) and severe frailty (N = 5; 16.1%). Reasons for surgical referral included low surgical risk (N = 11; 61.1%), excessive annulus size (N = 5; 27.8%), and aortic root dilatation (N = 2; 11.1%). Patients proceeding to SAVR had lower surgical risk than those in either the OMT or TAVI cohorts (P < 0.001). Mean STS score in SAVR group was 2.2 ± 1.3 vs. 4.5 ± 2.4 in OMT cohort and 6.1 ± 4.9 in TAVI cohort. Six-month all-cause mortality was 16.7, 19.4, and 9.3% among those receiving SAVR, OMT, and TAVI, respectively. Conclusions: Almost half of all patients with severe AS referred to a dedicated TAVI clinic did not receive a TAVI. A considerable proportion of patients were reclassified as moderate AS (13%), were asymptomatic (13%), or intervention was determined to be futile (13%) due to advanced frailty. Early detection and increased awareness of valvular heart disease are required to increase the number of patients that can benefit from TAVI.  "
Quantification of Initial Right Ventricular Dimensions by Computed Tomography in Infants with Congenital Heart Disease and a Hypoplastic Right Ventricle.  ;"OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the feasibility of using cardiothoracic CT for quantification of the initial right ventricle (RV) dimensions in infants with congenital heart disease (CHD) and a hypoplastic RV and to compare these measurements with those obtained in a control group with CHD without a hypoplastic RV. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Initial RV dimensions, including RV volumes, RV/left ventricle (LV) volume ratios, atrioventricular valve annulus diameter ratios, and RV/LV length ratios based on CT data, were collected from 57 infants with CHD and a hypoplastic RV (hypoplastic RV group; age range, 1 day to 6 months) and 33 infants with tetralogy of Fallot (control group; age range, 1 day to 6 months) and compared between the 2 groups. The type of final surgery was also evaluated in the hypoplastic RV group over a follow-up period of 3-8 years. RESULTS: The RV and LV volumes and lengths were successfully quantified in all 90 patients. The tricuspid valve annulus diameter could not be measured in cases showing muscular tricuspid atresia and double-inlet LV. The initial RV dimensions quantified by CT were significantly lower for the hypoplastic RV group than for the control group (p < 0.001). The types of final surgery performed in the hypoplastic RV group were univentricular repair in 46 patients, biventricular repair in 4 patients, or an indeterminate surgery in 7 patients. CONCLUSION: Initial RV dimensions in infants with CHD and a hypoplastic RV can be quantified by CT and are substantially smaller than those in infants with tetralogy of Fallot.  "
Preoperative Cardiac Computed Tomography Characteristics Associated with Recurrent Aortic Regurgitation after Aortic Valve Re-Implantation.  ;"OBJECTIVE: To identify the preoperative cardiac computed tomography (CT) factors influencing postoperative recurrent aortic regurgitation (AR) in patients who underwent aortic valve repair with the re-implantation technique (David operation) due to AR. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 117 patients (age, 49.4 ± 15.6 years; 83 males) who underwent the David operation for AR were included in this retrospective study. Aortic root profiles including the aortic regurgitant orifice area (ARO) and the aortic cusp asymmetry ratio of the areas (ASRarea), which is defined as the maximum/minimum areas among the three cusp areas at the level of the commissures, were measured on preoperative cardiac CT scans. Clinical and CT findings were compared between a group with recurrent AR grade < 3 (no, trivial, or mild AR) and recurrent ≥ 3 + AR. To determine the optimal cut-off values of ASR and ARO, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used. Cox regression analysis was used for the analysis of the factors affecting recurrent 3 + AR. RESULTS: Postoperatively, recurrent 3 + AR developed in 17 (14.5%) patients and occurred within a median of 268 days (interquartile range: 78-582 days). The cut-off ARO value for discriminating the patients with recurrent 3 + AR was > 24 mm² (sensitivity, 76.5%; specificity 64.8%), and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.72. For ASRarea, the cut-off value was > 1.58 (sensitivity, 76.5%; specificity, 58.0%) and the AUC was 0.64. Multivariable Cox regression showed that ARO > 24 mm² (hazard ratio = 3.79, p = 0.020) was a potential independent parameter for recurrent 3 + AR. ROC for the linear regression model showed that the AUC for both ARO and ASRarea was 0.73 (95% confidence interval, 0.64-0.81, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: ARO and ASRarea detected on preoperative cardiac CT would be potentially helpful for identifying AR patients who may benefit from the David operation.  "
Gender-specific differences in valvular heart disease.  ;The development of new devices and treatment options has greatly increased the interest in heart valve diseases. In this context, the consideration of gender differences in diagnosis, treatment success, and prognosis is of great importance. Available data show that women and men with heart valve disease have different risk profiles, which have a significant impact on treatment outcomes and prognosis.It is the purpose of this review article to give an overview of gender-related differences in patients with valvular heart disease, regarding clinical presentation, treatment, and outcomes. In light of the emerging treatment possibilities, future research should emphasize the role of gender since both sexes benefit from tailored management.

Trunk Muscle Cross-Sectional Area as a Predictive Factor for Length of Postoperative Hospitalization after Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement.  ;"PURPOSE: We investigated the utility of trunk muscle cross-sectional area to predict length of hospitalization after surgical aortic valve replacement (AVR) for aortic stenosis (AS). METHODS: Adult AS patients who underwent isolated AVR at a single institution were studied. The cross-sectional area of the erector spinae muscles (ESM) at the first and second lumbar vertebrae and that of the psoas muscle (PM) at the third and fourth lumbar vertebrae were measured on preoperative computed tomography (CT). Each was indexed to body surface area. Risk factors for prolonged postoperative hospitalization (>3 weeks) were assessed using multivariate regression analyses. RESULTS: Of 56 patients (mean age 76 ± 9 years; 25 men), 20 (35.7%) patients required prolonged hospitalization. A smaller indexed ESM cross-sectional area at the first lumbar vertebra (per 1 cm/m2, odds ratio [OR] = 0.71, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.57-0.88, P <0.01) and lower preoperative serum albumin level (per 0.1 g/dL, OR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.70-0.99, P <0.05) were shown as independent predictors. Indexed PM cross-sectional area was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: The cross-sectional area of the trunk muscles can be used to identify patients at risk for prolonged hospitalization after AVR for adult AS.  "
Behcet's disease involved the root of aorta in the treatment with modified Bentall procedure: a case report.  ;BACKGROUND: Behcet's disease (BD) is a multisystemic vasculitis of unknown etiology, the incidence of cardiovascular system involvement is rare, about1-5% (Sakane et al., N Engl J Med 341:1284-91, 1999). BD combined with aortic pseudoaneurysm and aortic valve regurgitation is usually need surgical treatment, but there is controversy about which surgical method to choose. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of BD combined with severe aortic valve regurgitation and two giant pseudoaneurysms of the aortic sinus. The patient underwent modified Bentall procedure (MBP) and use oral immunosuppressive as well as corticosteroid strictly, after 8 months follow-up, the patient recovered well. CONCLUSION: For patient with aortic valve regurgitation and ascend aortic pseudoaneurysm caused by BD, we recommend modified Bentall procedure when rheumatism in a stable period. Corticosteroids and immunosuppressive drugs should be used before and after surgery.  
Aberrant right coronary artery in a grown up congenital cardiac patient, successfully treated 46 years earlier with a double Starr-Edwards silastic ball valve replacement: a case report.  ;BACKGROUND: The Starr-Edwards ball valve prosthesis was successfully introduced in 1961-62 and largely used for aortic and mitral valve replacement. Even if Starr-Edwards valves have been widely replaced in clinical practice by other mechanical valves, they define a standard concerning long-term durability. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe the case of a 55-year-old man referred to our Department to perform a cardiac computed tomography (CCT), to better evaluate a severe dilation of ascending aorta discovered at echocardiography. The patient had been surgically treated 46 years earlier to correct a supra-cristal type ventricular septal defect. Both mitral and aortic valves were replaced, respectively due to bacterial mitral endocarditis and a fibrous sub-valvular aortic stenosis. In addition, the right coronary artery (RCA) was found to arise from the left coronary sinus. CONCLUSION: We report the longest lasting durability (46 years) of aortic and mitral Starr-Edwards valves successfully implanted in a patient simultaneously carrying a malignant anomalous origin of RCA.  
Ablation of ventricular tachycardia by direct left ventricle puncture through a minithoracotomy after double valve replacement: a case report and literature review.  ;We herein describe a 33-year-old woman with a mechanical aortic and mitral valve who developed repetitive monomorphic ventricular tachycardia with unstable hemodynamics. Catheter ablation by direct puncture at the left ventricular apex through a minithoracotomy successfully terminated the ventricular tachycardia, which had originated from the apical-septal endocardium in the left ventricle, despite the hindrance to routine access. No procedure-related complications or recurrence of the clinical ventricular tachycardia developed during a 66-month follow-up, demonstrating that endocardial ablation through direct cardiac cavity puncture can be considered in select cases.  
A biomechanical model of the pathological aortic valve: simulation of aortic stenosis.  ;"Aortic stenosis (AS) disease is a narrowing of the aortic valve (AV) opening which reduces blood flow from the heart causing several health complications. Although a lot of work has been done in AV simulations, most of the efforts have been conducted regarding healthy valves. In this article, a new three-dimensional patient-specific biomechanical model of the valve, based on a parametric formulation of the stenosis that permits the simulation of different degrees of pathology, is presented. The formulation is based on a double approach: the first one is done from the geometric point of view, reducing the effective ejection area of the AV by joining leaflets using a zipper effect to sew them; the second one, in terms of functionality, is based on the modification of AV tissue properties due to the effect of calcifications. Both healthy and stenotic valves were created using patient-specific data and results of the numerical simulation of the valve function are provided. Analysis of the results shows a variation in the first principal stress, geometric orifice area, and blood velocity which were validated against clinical data. Thus, the possibility to create a pipeline which allows the integration of patient-specific data from echocardiographic images and iFR studies to perform finite elements analysis is proved.  "

A cross-sectional evaluation of five warfarin anticoagulation services in Uganda and South Africa.  ;"INTRODUCTION: Warfarin is the most commonly prescribed oral anticoagulant in sub-Saharan Africa and requires ongoing monitoring. The burden of both infectious diseases and non-communicable diseases is high and medicines used to treat comorbidities may interact with warfarin. We describe service provision, patient characteristics, and anticoagulation control at selected anticoagulation clinics in Uganda and South Africa. METHODS: We evaluated two outpatient anticoagulation services in Kampala, Uganda and three in Cape Town, South Africa between 1 January and 31 July 2018. We collected information from key staff members about the clinics' service provision and extracted demographic and clinical data from a sample of patients' clinic records. We calculated time in therapeutic range (TTR) over the most recent 3-month period using the Rosendaal interpolation method. RESULTS: We included three tertiary level, one secondary level and one primary level anticoagulation service, seeing between 30 and 800 patients per month. Care was rendered by nurses, medical officers, and specialists. All healthcare facilities had on-site pharmacies; laboratory INR testing was off-site at two. Three clinics used warfarin dose-adjustment protocols; these were not validated for local use. We reviewed 229 patient clinical records. Most common indications for warfarin were venous thrombo-embolism in 112/229 (49%), atrial fibrillation in 74/229 (32%) and valvular heart disease in 30/229 (13%). Patients were generally followed up monthly. HIV prevalence was 20% and 5% at Ugandan and South African clinics respectively. Cardiovascular comorbidity predominated. Furosemide, paracetamol, enalapril, simvastatin, and tramadol were the most common concomitant drugs. Anticoagulation control was poor at all included clinics with median TTR of 41% (interquartile range 14% to 69%). CONCLUSIONS: TTR was suboptimal at all included sites, despite frequent patient follow-up. Strategies to improve INR control in sub-Saharan patients taking warfarin are needed. Locally validated warfarin dosing algorithms in Uganda and South Africa may improve INR control.  "
The Learning Curve for Shared Decision-making in Symptomatic Aortic Stenosis.  ;Comment in doi: 10.1001/jamacardio.2019.5860.  
[Sinus septal defect closure with correction of partial anomalous pulmonary vein drainage through mini-thoracotomy].  ;Mini-thoracotomy is one of the most popular minimally invasive approaches. This approach is used in the treatment of congenital and acquired heart diseases and characterized less surgical trauma, intraoperative blood loss, pain syndrome severity, risk of infectious complications and better cosmetic results. Successful correction of atrial septal defect (ASD) through right-sided mini-thoracotomy is reported in the article.  
Targeted Medical Therapies for Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy.  ;PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The management of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) has changed considerably over the years, although molecular therapies targeting core mechanisms of the disease are still lacking. This review provides an overview of the contemporary medical approach to patients with HCM, and of promising novel developments hopefully soon to enter the clinical arena. RECENT FINDINGS: Our perception of therapeutic targets for medical therapy in HCM is rapidly evolving. Novel approaches include myocardial metabolic modulation, late sodium current inhibition, and allosteric myosin inhibition, actively pursued to reduce and hopefully prevent the development of severe HCM phenotypes, improve symptom control, and preserve patients from disease-related complications. Clinical management of patients with HCM should be guided by in-depth knowledge of the complex mechanisms at the energetic, metabolic, and electrophysiologic level. Until new experimental therapies become available, tailored management of modifiable disease manifestations should be pursued, including lifestyle counseling and prevention of comorbidities.  
Dataset on the prognostic value of cardiac biomarkers used in clinical routine in patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing valve replacement.  ;"Hereby, the supplemental data of the research article ""Long-Term Prognostic Value of High-Sensitivity Troponin T added to N-Terminal Pro Brain Natriuretic Peptide Plasma Levels before Valve Replacement for Severe Aortic Stenosis"" are presented [1]. It offers enhanced input on the predictive value of these biomarkers considering the influence of the presence of concomitant coronary artery disease (CAD) in various severities as well as an additional cox proportional hazard model on cardiovascular mortality. Furthermore, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves are shown as figures. The material described increases therefore the understanding of the predictive value of these already routinely available biomarkers and reduces the risk of potential bias due to possible confounding factors. It also underlines the urge for a multi-factorial approach in diagnostics to detect the optimal point for referral to valve replacement other than just symptomatic status, an observed reduction in left ventricular ejection fraction or the presence of CAD with the necessity for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) [2]. The data of the 3595 patients were gathered retrospectively at a consortium of four university hospital centers in Austria and combined with prospectively collected data on cardiovascular and all-cause mortality.

Transcatheter Mitral Valve Implantation (TMVI) Using Edwards SAPIEN 3 Prostheses in Patients at Very High or Prohibitive Surgical Risk: A Single-Center Experience.  ;"BACKGROUND: Mitral valve surgery in patients with failing bioprosthesis, annuloplasty rings, or in patients with advanced mitral annular calcification (MAC) is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. Percutaneous antegrade transseptal transcatheter mitral valve implantation (TMVI) has recently successfully been performed in those patients at high or prohibitive surgical risk, but data on patients treated by TMVI are sparse. This study sought to evaluate short- and midterm outcomes of patients treated by TMVI at our site in clinical practice. METHODS AND RESULTS: From October 2016 to February 2018, seven patients (six women and one man) at high or prohibitive surgical risk underwent TMVI at our site. Three procedures were performed as TMVI in failed mitral valve bioprostheses (TMVI-VIV, ""valve-in-valve""), one procedure was performed as TMVI in a failed mitral annuloplasty ring (TMVI-R), and three procedures were performed as TMVI in advanced native mitral annular calcification (TMVI-MAC). Mean age of the population treated was 77 ± 8.1 years, and mean log EuroScore I was 39 ± 0.12%. In all patients, an Edwards SAPIEN 3 transcatheter heart valve was implanted under 3D-TOE and fluoroscopic guidance using a transvenous/transseptal access. Indication for TMVI was the presence of advanced heart failure symptoms in all patients (NYHA class III/IV). The predominant dysfunction of the mitral valve treated was severe regurgitation in 72% (n = 5) and severe stenosis in 29% (n = 2) of all patients. TMVI was technically successful in all procedures. Clinical success with functional improvement of at least one NYHA class after procedure compared with before procedure was also achieved in all patients. Median NYHA class improved significantly from 4 before procedure to 2 after TMVI (p=0.008). Mitral valve regurgitation was reduced to trace or mild in all but one patient, who showed moderate MR after TMVI-MAC. No patient-prosthesis mismatch or LVOT obstruction occurred after TMVI. Two patients underwent interventional ASD closure during the in-hospital course due to a large and persisting atrial septal defect after transseptal access. One patient underwent pacemaker implantation due to complete AV-block after TMVI. One patient died in hospital 12 days after the procedure due to severe hospital-acquired pneumonia and sepsis. In-hospital mortality rate was 14% (1/7) in this high-risk population. After hospital discharge, no death occurred and clinical improvement-according to NYHA functional class-remained stable during one-year follow-up. CONCLUSION: In this small single-center series, TMVI appears promising for patients at high or prohibitive surgical risk with either failing mitral bioprostheses/annuloplasty rings or native mitral valve dysfunction in combination with advanced MAC. Gaining experience in TMVI and new valves will further improve safety and efficacy of this new treatment option.  "
An Optimized Approach for Transfemoral Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation: A Comprehensive Review and Current Evidence.  ;"Device iterations and technical refinements have enabled transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) to be offered as a routine interventional procedure in many centers with high reproducibility and success. The concept of a streamlined procedure with appropriate procedural optimization, namely ""optimized approach,"" has become increasingly relevant, aimed at minimizing perioperative burden and promoting early recovery. Relatively high device costs may be mitigated by reducing length of hospital stay and resource utilization. This review summarizes current evidence of components related to the optimization process during transfemoral TAVI. It is important to customize the procedure specific to each patient for its optimization.  "
A meta-analysis of perventricular device closure of doubly committed subarterial ventricular septal defects.  ;BACKGROUND: To investigate the safety and efficacy of perventricular device closure of doubly committed subarterial ventricular septal defects (dcsVSDs). METHODS: PubMed and Scopus were searched for studies in English that focused on perventricular device closure of dcsVSDs and were published up to the end of September 2019. We used a random-effects model to obtain pooled estimates of the success and complication rates. RESULTS: A total of 9 publications including 459 patients with dcsVSDs were included. The median follow-up duration ranged from 2 months to 5 years, with the mean age of patients ranging from 6.1 months to 4.5 years. The pooled estimate of the overall success rate of device closure in the 9 studies was 0.89 (95% CI: 0.86-0.93, I2 = 26.5%, P = 0.208). Further meta-regression analysis indicated no significant correlation between the success rate and the following factors: publication year, sample size, study type, mean age, mean weight, mean VSD size, and ratio of device size/weight. The pooled rate of postoperative aortic regurgitation was 0.045 (95% CI: 0.018-0.071, I2 = 50.96%, P = 0.000). The pooled rate of follow-up aortic regurgitation (AR) was 0.001 (95% CI, - 0.003-0.004, I2 = 63.00%, P = 0.009.) The pooled estimated rate of severe intraoperative complications was 0.106 (0.073-0.140, I2 = 70.7%, P = 0.208). Postoperative and follow-up complications were rare. No occurrence of a complete atrioventricular block was reported up to the last follow-up visit. CONCLUSIONS: Perventricular device closure may be an alternative to conventional surgical repair in selected patients with dcsVSDs. The success rate was stable regarding the publication year and sample size, suggesting a relatively short learning curve and the technique's potential for application.

Acute Coronary Syndrome Following Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.  ;BACKGROUND: Scarce data exist on coronary events following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), and no study has determined the factors associated with poorer outcomes in this setting. This study sought to determine the clinical characteristics, outcomes, and prognostic factors of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) events following TAVR. METHODS: Multicenter cohort study including a total of 270 patients presenting an ACS after a median time of 12 (interquartile range, 5-17) months post-TAVR. Post-ACS death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and overall major adverse cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events were recorded. RESULTS: The ACS clinical presentation consisted of non-ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) type 2 (31.9%), non-STEMI type 1 (31.5%), unstable angina (28.5%), and STEMI (8.1%). An invasive strategy was used in 163 patients (60.4%), and a percutaneous coronary intervention was performed in 97 patients (35.9%). Coronary access issues were observed in 2.5% and 2.1% of coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention procedures, respectively. The in-hospital mortality rate was 10.0%, and at a median follow-up of 17 (interquartile range, 5-32) months, the rates of death, stroke, myocardial infarction, and major adverse cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events were 43.0%, 4.1%, 15.2%, and 52.6%, respectively. By multivariable analysis, revascularization at ACS time was associated with a reduction of the risk of all-cause death (hazard ratio, 0.54 [95% CI, 0.36-0.81] P=0.003), whereas STEMI increased the risk of all-cause death (hazard ratio, 2.06 [95% CI, 1.05-4.03] P=0.036) and major adverse cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events (hazard ratio, 1.97 [95% CI, 1.08-3.57] P=0.026). CONCLUSIONS: ACS events in TAVR recipients exhibited specific characteristics (ACS presentation, low use of invasive procedures, coronary access issues) and were associated with a poor prognosis, with a very high in-hospital and late death rate. STEMI and the lack of coronary revascularization determined an increased risk. These results should inform future studies to improve both the prevention and management of ACS post-TAVR.  
Outcomes of Degenerative Mitral Valve Repair Surgery for Anterior, Posterior, and Bileaflet Pathology.  ;"BACKGROUND: Degenerative mitral valve disease involving anterior leaflet pathology is considered less favorable regarding durability of surgical repair than isolated posterior leaflet disease. We aimed to compare the outcomes of patients undergoing mitral valve repair for anterior, posterior, and bileaflet pathologies, and to investigate predictors for repair failure. METHODS: Of the 760 consecutive patients with degenerative leaflet disease who underwent mitral valve repair, 485 (64%) had posterior, 223 (29%) had bileaflet, and 52 (7%) had anterior leaflet pathology. Mean age was 58 ± 12, 54 ± 14, and 58 ± 17 years, respectively (P = .001). Mean follow-up was 67 ± 47 months. RESULTS: There was no in-hospital or 30-day mortality. Freedom from reoperation was 97%, 95%, and 92%, respectively, and there were 25 (5%), 9 (4%), and 1 (2%) late deaths in the posterior, bileaflet, and anterior groups, respectively (not significant). Late echocardiography revealed that 94%, 97%, and 96% of patients (posterior, bileaflet, and anterior groups respectively) were free from moderate-severe or severe mitral regurgitation (P = .375). Postoperative residual mild mitral regurgitation emerged as the strongest predictor for recurrent mitral regurgitation (grade 3/4) at follow-up (hazard ratio = 2.36; 95% confidence interval, 1.30-4.29; P = .005). Unlike patients with excess mitral tissue, among patients with fibroelastic deficiency or those who underwent major leaflet resection, the use of larger ring annuloplasty was associated with recurrent mitral regurgitation (hazard ratio = 1.31/ring size increment; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Mitral valve repair can be achieved with excellent early and intermediate results across all valve pathologies. Further studies are required to determine the potential long-term impact of the underlying pathology on the rate of recurrent mitral regurgitation.  "
Feasibility of His-bundle pacing in patients with conduction disorders following transcatheter aortic valve replacement.  ;"BACKGROUND: Conduction disorders requiring permanent pacemaker implantation occur frequently after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). This multicenter study explored the feasibility and safety of His bundle pacing (HBP) in TAVR patients with a pacemaker indication to correct a TAVR-induced left bundle branch block (LBBB). METHODS: Patients qualifying for a permanent pacemaker implant after TAVR were planned for HBP implant. HBP was performed using the Select Secure (3830; Medtronic) pacing lead, delivered through a fixed curve or deflectable sheath (C315HIS or C304; Medtronic). Successful HBP was defined as selective or nonselective HBP, irrespective of LBB recruitment. Successful LBBB correction was defined as selective or nonselective HBP resulting in paced QRS morphology similar to pre-TAVR QRS and paced QRS duration (QRSd) less than 120 milliseconds with thresholds less than 3.0 V at 1.0-millisecond pulse width. RESULTS: The study enrolled 16 patients requiring a permanent pacemaker after TAVR (age 85 ± 4 years, 31% female, all LBBB; QRSd: 161 ± 14 milliseconds). Capture of the His bundle was achieved in 13 of 16 (81%) patients. HBP with LBBB correction was achieved in 11 of 16 (69%) and QRSd narrowed from 162 ± 14 to 99 ± 13 milliseconds and 134 ± 7 milliseconds during S-HBP and NS-HBP, respectively (P = .005). At implantation, mean threshold for LBBB correction was 1.9 ± 1.1 V at 1.0 millisecond. Thresholds remained stable at 11 ± 4 months follow-up (1.8 ± 0.9 V at 1.0 millisecond, P = .231 for comparison with implant thresholds). During HBP implant, one temporary complete atrioventricular block occurred. CONCLUSION: Permanent HBP is feasible in the majority of patients with TAVR requiring a permanent pacemaker with the potential to correct a TAVR-induced LBBB with acceptable pacing thresholds.  "
Transcatheter aortic valve implantation in nonagenarians: insights from the German Aortic Valve Registry (GARY).  ;OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the outcome of nonagenarians (≥ 90 years) with that of younger (< 90 years) patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in current practice. METHODS: Data are collected from the German Aortic Valve Registry (GARY), which was designed to evaluate current practice in the invasive treatment of patients with aortic valve diseases in Germany. Data were analyzed regarding procedural outcome, 30-day, and 1-year outcomes of nonagenarians in comparison to that of younger patients. RESULTS: Between 2011 and 2015, 2436/33,051 (7.3%) nonagenarians underwent TAVI and were included in GARY. Nonagenarians were significantly more often male (45.2% vs. 40.0%, p < 0.001), frail (38.7% vs. 34.7%, p < 0.001), and had higher EuroSCORE scores than younger patient group (23.2% vs. 17.0%). Nonagenarians were significantly less often treated via transapical access (16.3% vs. 22.3%, p < 0.001). Procedure was performed significantly less often in general anesthesia (58.2% vs. 60.7%, p = 0.02) in nonagenarians, while necessity of pacemaker implantation was significantly higher in nonagenarians (27.2% vs. 24.8%, p > 0.001). The incidence of other typical postprocedural complications such as severe bleeding events and vascular complications were comparable between groups. However, 30-day (5.2% vs. 3.9%) and 1-year (22.7% vs. 17.7%) mortality rates were significantly higher among nonagenarians and age ≥ 90 years could be identified as an isolated risk factor for mortality. CONCLUSION: TAVI is a highly standardized procedure that can be performed safely with high procedural success even in very old patients. Although mortality is significantly higher in these patients-most probably due to the intrinsic higher risk profile of the very old patients-the results are still acceptable. To optimize outcome, especially elderly patients seem to profit from a procedure under local anesthesia or conscious sedation, to minimize the rate of postoperative delirium and the length of stay and to facilitate early mobilization.

Transcatheter Mitral Valve Replacement: Rationale and Current Status.  ;Mitral regurgitation (MR) is the most prevalent form of moderate or severe valve disease in the developed world. MR can result from impairment of any part of the mitral valve apparatus and is classified as primary (disease of the leaflets) or secondary (functional). The presence of at least moderate MR is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. With the goal of avoiding the risks of traditional surgery, transcatheter mitral valve therapies have been developed. The current transcatheter repair techniques are limited by therapeutic target and incomplete MR reduction, and thus transcatheter mitral valve replacement (TMVR) has been pursued. Several devices (both transapical and transseptal) are under development, with both early feasibility and pivotal trials under way. As this field develops, the decision to treat with TMVR will require a heart team approach that takes patient-, disease-, and device-specific factors into account.  
Does Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation for Aortic Stenosis Impact on Cognitive Function?  ;Aortic stenosis (AS) is the most common valvular heart disease among elderly patients in developed countries. Surgical valve replacement is indicated for severe AS to relieve the obstructed outflow tract. Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has emerged as an alternative for patients with severe AS, particularly in those with high surgical risk. TAVI is a less invasive approach with favorable survival outcomes in high-risk patients compared with open surgery. Despite the remarkable success of TAVI, there is a growing concern on the incidence of postprocedural cognitive impairment. This review aims to evaluate the incidence of cognitive impairment following TAVI and to identify the potential contributing factors.  
Sleeve valve-sparing procedure in bicuspid aortic valve: early and midterm clinical results.  ;BACKGROUND: Patients with aortic root ectasia and bicuspid aortic valve benefit of the treatment with aortic valve sparing procedure, with excellent long-term results. The Sleeve-procedure is one of the options in patients with aortic root diseases and it might be suitable for patients with a bicuspid valve. METHODS: From October 2006 to December 2018, 42 consecutive patients with bicuspid aortic valve and aortic root ectasia/aneurysm, with or without aortic regurgitation, were surgically treated with the Sleeve-procedure. RESULTS: In 20 patients (48%) leaflets surgery was necessary and consisted of raphe mobilization/resection in 17 patients, plication of both leaflets in 2 patients and a two-commissures resuspension in 1 patient. During a mean clinical follow-up time of 4.4±3.1 years, the survival rate was 100%, 1 patient required a reoperation at 6.1 years postoperatively, with an overall freedom from reoperation of 94±5%. The rest of the patients (41/42), had no more than mild residual aortic valve regurgitation. With a mean follow-up of 4.3±1.7 years the magnetic resonance imaging performed in 26 patients, did not show signs of aortic wall herniation through the key-holes or persisting creases of the aortic wall inside the prosthesis. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with aortic root disease and bicuspid aortic valve may be treated with Sleeve technique with excellent midterm results. However, a longer follow-up is required before drawing any solid conclusion.  
Spontaneous rupture of a mechanical valve in a mitral position (On-X) with migration-embolization to aortic bifurcation from the perspective of the vascular surgeon.  ;"We report on the case of spontaneous rupture of an On-X-pure pyrolytic carbon mechanical valve prosthesis implanted seven years earlier, in a mitral position, at our hospital. The patient was admitted with valvular dysfunction and acute pulmonary edema requiring emergency surgery (prosthesis replacement); the absence of a leaflet was confirmed intraoperatively. The patient presented severe respiratory failure, which prolonged the postoperative period. A CT scan showed that the migrated leaflet was located in the aortic bifurcation with no apparent arterial lesion. Four months later, once the patient had recovered, laparotomy and aortotomy were performed in order to retrieve the leaflet, which was found to have become included (neoendothelized) in the aortic wall without compromising the latter's integrity or obstructing the blood flow. A subsequent CT scan confirmed the persistence of the leaflet in its initial position. The literature review highlights two singular facts: 1) this is the second published case of the escape of a leaflet from an On-X prosthesis (the first patient died); 2) this is the first case in which a laparotomy was performed to retrieve the leaflet but finally a decision was made to leave it in situ. Seven months later, the patient remained asymptomatic.  "
Novel KLHL26 variant associated with a familial case of Ebstein's anomaly and left ventricular noncompaction.  ;BACKGROUND: Ebstein's anomaly (EA) is a rare congenital heart disease of the tricuspid valve and right ventricle. Patients with EA often manifest with left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC), a cardiomyopathy. Despite implication of cardiac sarcomere genes in some cases, very little is understood regarding the genetic etiology of EA/LVNC. Our study describes a multigenerational family with at least 10 of 17 members affected by EA/LVNC. METHODS: We performed echocardiography on all family members and conducted exome sequencing of six individuals. After identifying candidate variants using two different bioinformatic strategies, we confirmed segregation with phenotype using Sanger sequencing. We investigated structural implications of candidate variants using protein prediction models. RESULTS: Exome sequencing analysis of four affected and two unaffected members identified a novel, rare, and damaging coding variant in the Kelch-like family member 26 (KLHL26) gene located on chromosome 19 at position 237 of the protein (GRCh37). This variant region was confirmed by Sanger sequencing in the remaining family members. KLHL26 (c.709C > T p.R237C) segregates only with EA/LVNC-affected individuals (FBAT p < .05). Investigating structural implications of the candidate variant using protein prediction models suggested that the KLHL26 variant disrupts electrostatic interactions when binding to part of the ubiquitin proteasome, specifically Cullin3 (CUL3), a component of E3 ubiquitin ligase. CONCLUSION: In this familial case of EA/LVNC, we have identified a candidate gene variant, KLHL26 (p.R237C), which may have an important role in ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation during cardiac development.  
Ankylosing Spondyloarthritis Resulting Severe Aortic Insufficiency and Aortitis: Exacerbation of Ankylosing Spondyloarthritis and Stenosis of the Main Left Coronary Artery after Mechanical Aortic Valve Implantation with Cardiopulmonary Bypass.  ;Ankylosing spondyloarthritis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory rheumatic disease, strongly related to human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27. Cardiac involvement in AS manifests in 2 to 10% of patients as aortic insufficiency, aortitis, mitral valve fibrosis, or disturbance in the conduction of the heart. In this article, we present a case of a 49-year-old male patient with AS, who was referred to our medical institution for elective aortic valve surgery because of severe aortic regurgitation. The histological findings revealed fibrosing endocarditis of aortic valve and nonspecific aortitis of aortic root. Late postoperatively, we observed exacerbation of AS and narrowing of the main left coronary artery (LAD). Our case highlights the importance of proper treatment of AS before and after cardiac surgery. Furthermore, in this case, we suspect association between cardiopulmonary bypass, activity of AS, and coronary artery disease.  
Early cost-utility analysis of tissue-engineered heart valves compared to bioprostheses in the aortic position in elderly patients.  ;OBJECTIVES: Aortic valve disease is the most frequent indication for heart valve replacement with the highest prevalence in elderly. Tissue-engineered heart valves (TEHV) are foreseen to have important advantages over currently used bioprosthetic heart valve substitutes, most importantly reducing valve degeneration with subsequent reduction of re-intervention. We performed early Health Technology Assessment of hypothetical TEHV in elderly patients (≥ 70 years) requiring surgical (SAVR) or transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) to assess the potential of TEHV and to inform future development decisions. METHODS: Using a patient-level simulation model, the potential cost-effectiveness of TEHV compared with bioprostheses was predicted from a societal perspective. Anticipated, but currently hypothetical improvements in performance of TEHV, divided in durability, thrombogenicity, and infection resistance, were explored in scenario analyses to estimate quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gain, cost reduction, headroom, and budget impact. RESULTS: Durability of TEHV had the highest impact on QALY gain and costs, followed by infection resistance. Improved TEHV performance (- 50% prosthetic valve-related events) resulted in lifetime QALY gains of 0.131 and 0.043, lifetime cost reductions of €639 and €368, translating to headrooms of €3255 and €2498 per hypothetical TEHV compared to SAVR and TAVI, respectively. National savings in the first decade after implementation varied between €2.8 and €11.2 million (SAVR) and €3.2-€12.8 million (TAVI) for TEHV substitution rates of 25-100%. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the relatively short life expectancy of elderly patients undergoing SAVR/TAVI, hypothetical TEHV are predicted to be cost-effective compared to bioprostheses, commercially viable and result in national cost savings when biomedical engineers succeed in realising improved durability and/or infection resistance of TEHV.  
Induction of aortic valve calcification by celecoxib and its COX-2 independent derivatives is glucocorticoid-dependent.  ;BACKGROUND: Celecoxib, a selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, was recently associated with increased incidence of aortic stenosis and found to produce a valvular calcification risk in vitro. Several cyclooxygenase-2 independent celecoxib derivatives have been developed and identified as possible therapies for inflammatory diseases due to their cadherin-11 inhibitory functions. Potential cardiovascular toxicities associated with these cyclooxygenase-2 independent celecoxib derivatives have not yet been investigated. Furthermore, the mechanism by which celecoxib produces valvular toxicity is not known. METHODS AND RESULTS: Celecoxib treatment produces a 2.8-fold increase in calcification in ex vivo porcine aortic valve leaflets and a more than 2-fold increase in calcification in porcine aortic valve interstitial cells cultured in osteogenic media. Its cyclooxygenase-2 independent derivative, 2,5-dimethylcelecoxib, produces a similar 2.5-fold increase in calcification in ex vivo leaflets and a 13-fold increase in porcine aortic valve interstitial cells cultured in osteogenic media. We elucidate that this offtarget effect depends on the presence of either of the two media components: dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid used for osteogenic induction, or cortisol, a natural glucocorticoid present at basal levels in the fetal bovine serum. In the absence of glucocorticoids, these inhibitors effectively reduce calcification. By adding glucocorticoids or hydrocortisone to a serum substitute lacking endogenous glucocorticoids, we show that dimethylcelecoxib conditionally induces a 3.5-fold increase in aortic valve calcification and osteogenic expression. Treatment with the Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitor, U0126, rescues the offtarget effect, suggesting that celecoxib and dimethylcelecoxib conditionally augment Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular-signal-regulated kinase activity in the presence of glucocorticoids. CONCLUSION: Here we identify glucocorticoids as a possible source of the increased valvular calcification risk associated with celecoxib and its cyclooxygenase-2 independent derivatives. In the absence of glucocorticoids, these inhibitors effectively reduce calcification. Furthermore, the offtarget effects are not due to the drug's intrinsic properties as dual cyclooxygenase-2 and cadherin-11 inhibitors. These findings inform future design and development of celecoxib derivatives for potential clinical therapy.

Transcatheter closure of a perimembranous ventricular septal defect with Nit-Occlud Lê VSD Coil: A French multicentre study.  ;"BACKGROUND: Transcatheter perimembranous ventricular septal defect (pmVSD) closure remains challenging and is seldom used in France given the risk of atrioventricular block (AVB). pmVSD closure with the Nit-Occlud Lê VSD coil was recently introduced in France as an alternative to occluder devices. AIMS: To study the safety and feasibility of pmVSD closure with the Nit-Occlud Lê VSD coil. METHODS: All consecutives cases of pmVSD closure with the Nit-Occlud Lê VSD coil in 20 tertiary French centres were included between January 2015 and December 2018. RESULTS: Among 46 procedures in five centres, indications for pmVSD closure were left ventricle overload (76.1%), exertional dyspnoea (17.4%), history of infective endocarditis (4.3%) and mild pulmonary hypertension (2.2%). The median (interquartile [IQR]) age of the patients was 13.9 (5.7-31.8) years. Aneurismal tissue was identified in 91.3% of patients. VSD median (IQR) size was 8 (7-10) mm on the left ventricle side and 5 (4-6) mm on the right ventricle side. Implantation was successful in 40 patients (87.0%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 73.7-95.1%). Severe complications occurred in six patients (13.0%, 95% CI 4.9-26.3%), mainly severe haemolysis (8.7%, 95% CI 2.4-20.8%). One aortic valve lesion required surgical aortic valvuloplasty. Occurrence of severe complications was significantly related to the presence of haemolysis (P=0.001), residual shunt (P=0.007) and multi-exit VSD (P=0.005). Residual shunt was observed in 40% of cases with the implanted device shortly after closure and 15% after a median follow-up of 27 months. No immediate or delayed device embolization or complete AVB was recorded. CONCLUSION: pmVSD closure with the Nit-Occlud Lê VSD Coil is feasible in older children and adults. However, residual shunting (leading to haemolysis) is a dreaded complication that should not be tolerated. pmVSD closure with the Nit-Occlud Lê VSD as a therapeutic strategy remains controversial and is limited to selected patients.

Prognostic Implications of Renal Dysfunction in Patients With Aortic Stenosis.  ;"Aortic stenosis (AS) and renal dysfunction share risk factors and often occur simultaneously. The influence of renal dysfunction on the prognosis of patients with various grades of AS has not been extensively described. The present study aimed to assess the prognostic implications of renal dysfunction in a large cohort of patients with aortic sclerosis and patients with various grades of AS. Patients diagnosed with various grades of AS by transthoracic echocardiography were assessed and divided according to renal function by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). The occurrence of all-cause mortality (primary end point) and aortic valve replacement (AVR) was noted. Of 1,178 patients (mean age 70 ± 13 years, 60% male), 327 (28%) had aortic sclerosis, 86 (7%) had mild AS, 285 (24%) had moderate AS, and 480 (41%) had severe AS. Renal dysfunction (eGFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m2) was present in 440 (37%) patients, and moderate to severe AS was observed more often in these patients compared to patients without (70 vs 62%, respectively; p = 0.008). After a median follow-up of 95 [31 to 149] months, 626 (53%) patients underwent AVR and 549 (47%) patients died. Severely impaired renal function (eGFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m2) and AVR were independently associated with all-cause mortality after correcting for AS severity. In conclusion, renal dysfunction is highly prevalent in patients with various grades of AS. After correcting for AS severity and AVR, severely impaired renal function (eGFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m2) was independently associated with all-cause mortality. Independent of renal function, AVR was associated with improved survival.  "

Use of a Dual-Filter Cerebral Embolic Protection Device in Thoracic Endovascular Aortic Repair.  ;"BACKGROUND: The risk of periprocedural stroke after thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) ranges from 3% to 8%. Although cerebral embolic protection devices (CEPD) are widely utilized in transcatheter aortic valve replacement, there are currently no Food and Drug Administration approved CEPDs for use in TEVAR. We report our initial experience with the off-label use of a dual-filter CEPD in patients undergoing TEVAR. METHODS: Two patients at high risk for embolic stroke underwent TEVAR for descending thoracic aortic aneurysms (DTAAs) at a single institution. A dual-filter CEPD (Sentinel; Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA) was used in an off-label fashion in both cases. Patient 1 was a 62-year-old woman with a 6.2-cm DTAA, extending from the left subclavian artery (LSCA) to the diaphragm (Zones 3-5) and associated with extensive atherosclerotic disease of the aortic arch. Patient 2 was a 78-year-old woman with a 6.3-cm DTAA, extending from the LSCA (Zone 2) to the sixth intercostal space (Zone 4) with associated mural thrombus. Given the proximity of the aneurysm to the LSCA, a left carotid-subclavian bypass was performed for planned LSCA coverage. RESULTS: Through a percutaneous right radial artery approach using a 6F sheath, the Sentinel dual-filter CEPD was delivered over a 0.014″ guidewire into the thoracic aorta. Under fluoroscopic guidance, the 2 filters were sequentially deployed in the innominate and left common carotid arteries, respectively. Appropriately sized devices were successfully delivered and deployed in the proximal and distal landing zones, respectively. Two devices were used for each patient. Completion angiograms showed successful exclusion of the DTAAs in both cases, without evidence of endoleak. The CEPD filters were retrieved in standard fashion without difficulty. Pathology demonstrated successful capture of embolic debris and fibrin clot in both patients. Neither patient exhibited neurological deficits or device-related complications. Both patients remained neurologically intact at 1- and 2-month follow-up, respectively. Surveillance angiograms revealed successful exclusion of the aneurysm without any evidence of endoleak. CONCLUSIONS: We report the novel off-label use of a dual-filter CEPD in 2 patients undergoing TEVAR. Pathological confirmation of embolic debris in the filters makes this a potential tool for stroke prevention during TEVAR in high-risk patients.  "
A single nucleotide deletion resulting in a frameshift in exon 4 of TAB2 is associated with a polyvalular syndrome.  ;OBJECTIVE: Polyvalvularmyxomatous degeneration is a rare clinical condition. A 51-year-old male patient presented at our centre with all four heart valves with myxomatous degeneration and severe mitral and aortic regurgitation due to leaflet prolapse. The patient referred five further family members with valvular heart disease at different stages of presentation. The aim of this study was to investigate the genetic basis of this familial polyvalvularmyxomatous degeneration which was associated with mild dysmorphic facial anomalies and short stature. DESIGN: A detailed family history was recorded. Nine members of the family, affected or not by valvular heart disease, were studied clinically, echocardiographically and by detailed genetic analyses. RESULTS: Six of the nine family members had echocardiographic features of different degrees of degenerative heart valve disease. In addition, the affected subjects shared similar mild dysmorphic facial anomalies and short stature. Exome sequencing identified a rare heterozygous single nucleotide deletion in the TAB2 gene in all affected family members, which was absent in the unaffected members. CONCLUSIONS: A variant in the TAB2 gene is proposed as the cause of syndromic congenital heart disease, displaying congenital myxomatous degenerative heart valve disease, mild dysmorphic fascial anomalies and short stature in this family.  
Readmission After Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement in the United States.  ;"BACKGROUND: Reducing inpatient readmissions is a national priority for improving healthcare quality and decreasing costs. Previous studies have shown that readmissions after surgical aortic valve replacement are frequent and contribute to increased healthcare costs, yet no studies have analyzed risk factors for readmission. METHODS: The Nationwide Readmissions Database was used to identify adult patients undergoing surgical aortic valve replacement from 2010 to 2015. Incidence, patient characteristics, causes, resource utilization, and predictors of 30-day readmission were determined. International Classification of Diseases codes were used to capture surgical aortic valve replacement. RESULTS: Among 136,051 patients, 18,631 (13.7%) were readmitted within 30 days of discharge. Readmitted patients were more commonly women (47.4% vs 41.6%; P < .001) and were older (70.4 years of age vs 68.3 years of age; P < .001), with higher Elixhauser comorbidity index (5.4 vs 4.8; P < .001), rates of postoperative complications (44.0% vs 37.3%; P < .001), and greater length of stay (10.9 days vs 8.5 days; P < .001). The mean cost of 1 readmission episode was $13,426. On multivariable analysis, significant predictors of readmission were female sex, age greater than 75 years, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney and liver disease, and lower surgical aortic valve replacement hospital volume. A total of 49.1% of readmissions were related to cardiac causes, with heart failure (13.2%) and arrhythmia (12.5%) being the most common. CONCLUSIONS: Using a national inpatient database, we found readmission after surgical aortic valve replacement to be common and resource-intensive. Enhanced management of comorbidities and targeted postdischarge interventions for patients at high risk of readmission may help decrease healthcare utilization.  "
Valve-Sparing Root Replacement Versus Composite Valve Grafting in Aortic Root Dilation: A Meta-Analysis.  ;"BACKGROUND: Aortic valve-sparing operations theoretically have fewer stroke and bleeding complications but may increase late reoperation risk versus composite valve grafts. METHODS: We meta-analyzed all studies comparing aortic valve-sparing (reimplantation and remodelling) and composite valve-grafting (bioprosthetic and mechanical) procedures. Early outcomes were all-cause mortality, reoperation for bleeding, myocardial infarction, and thromboembolism/stroke. Long-term outcomes included all-cause mortality, reintervention, bleeding, and thromboembolism/stroke. Studies exclusively investigating dissection or pediatric populations were excluded. RESULTS: A total of 3794 patients who underwent composite valve grafting and 2424 who underwent aortic valve-sparing procedures were included from 9 adjusted and 17 unadjusted observational studies. Mean follow-up was 5.8 ± 3.0 years. Aortic valve sparing was not associated with any difference in early mortality, bleeding, myocardial infarction, or thromboembolic complications. Late mortality was significantly lower after valve sparing (incident risk ratio, 0.68; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.54-0.87; P < .01). Late thromboembolism/stroke (incident rate ratio, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.22-0.60; P < .01) and bleeding (incident rate ratio, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.11-0.42; P < .01) risks were lower after valve sparing. Procedure type did not affect late reintervention. CONCLUSIONS: Aortic valve sparing appears to be safe and associated with reduced late mortality, thromboembolism/stroke, and bleeding compared with composite valve grafting. Late durability is equivalent. Aortic valve sparing should be considered in patients with favorable aortic valve morphology.  "
Transcatheter vs surgical aortic valve replacement in patients with interstitial lung disease.  ;"BACKGROUND: Patients with underlying interstitial lung disease (ILD) who undergo cardiac surgery are at high risk of postoperative pulmonary complications. It remains unclear if transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) offers any benefit over surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in ILD patients with severe aortic stenosis. METHODS: All adult patients with a diagnosis of ILD who underwent either a TAVR or isolated SAVR between January 2002 and December 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. Operative mortality, 30-day readmissions, and adjusted 1-year survival were compared between the two cohorts. RESULTS: The overall cohort included 52 TAVR and 74 SAVR patients. While TAVR patients were significantly older (77.2 vs 72.9 years) with higher Society of Thoracic Surgeons predicted risk of mortality (STS-PROM) scores compared with SAVR patients (6.29 vs 4.49; all P < .02), operative mortality was similar (5.8% vs 4.1%; P =  .45). Rates of postoperative stroke, permanent pacemaker implantation, reintubation, and 30-day readmissions did not differ between the two groups (all P > .46). However, TAVR was associated with significantly shorter hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay, shorter ventilation times, and less requirement for ICU admission (all P < .05). Thirty-day readmissions and adjusted 1-year survival were also similar between the two groups (hazard ratio for TAVR vs SAVR = 1.34; 95% CI: 0.7-2.6). CONCLUSIONS: Among ILD patients with symptomatic aortic stenosis, TAVR was associated with comparable operative and risk-adjusted 1-year survival to SAVR. TAVR patients also had shorter ventilator times, ICU and hospital stay despite being at higher risk. Together, our findings suggest that TAVR may be a better option in this unique cohort.  "
Short-term competency of aortic valve repair in Egyptian patients.  ;"OBJECTIVES: In recent years, repair techniques for diseased aortic valves have received increasing attention. This study reports the short-term outcome of aortic valve repair (AVr) for three pathologic categories: rheumatic heart disease, aortic regurgitations (ARs) from subarterial ventricular septal defect (VSD), and infective endocarditis in order achieve the valve competency. METHODS: From January 2017 to March 2019, 30 patients underwent AVr with significant AR in the National Heart Institute (NHI) and Banha university. All patients underwent echocardiography before and after the procedure; 30 patients underwent AVr with significant AR, nine patients (30%) with juxta-arterial VSD, two patients (6.66%) with infective endocarditis (IE), and 19 patients (63.33%) with rheumatic aortic valve disease. For intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography and direct examination for better clarification of the anatomy and guidance of repair after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), annular repair, leaflet repair by shaving, plication, triangular resection, augmentation with the pericardium, and VSD closure were done. RESULTS: Only three patients developed aortic incompetence grade II, no in-hospital mortality; however, we had 3 months later mortality for one patient with IE, only one patient with rheumatic heart disease progressed from grade II to grade IV aortic incompetence (AI) and aortic valve replacement was done so AVr was successfully done for the subaortic VSD, rheumatic, and IE patients instead of replacement of the valve. CONCLUSIONS: In favor of AVr, good patient selection, amenable techniques for the suitable pathology will give a good target hence the aim of the work.  "
Treatment decision for transcatheter aortic valve implantation: the role of the heart team : Position statement paper of the Dutch Working Group of Transcatheter Heart Interventions.  ;The current paper presents a position statement of the Dutch Working Group of Transcatheter Heart Valve Interventions that describes which patients with aortic stenosis should be considered for transcatheter aortic valve implantation and how this treatment proposal/decision should be made. Given the complexity of the disease and the assessment of its severity, in particular in combination with the continuous emergence of new clinical insights and evidence from physiological and randomised clinical studies plus the introduction of novel innovative treatment modalities, the gatekeeper of the treatment proposal/decision and, thus, of qualification for cost reimbursement is the heart team, which consists of dedicated professionals working in specialised centres.  
Characteristics and outcomes of patients with normal left atrial pressure undergoing transcatheter mitral valve repair.  ;"OBJECTIVE: A subset of patients at the time of transcatheter mitral valve repair (TMVR) will have normal left atrial pressure (LAP) (<13 mm Hg) despite having severe mitral regurgitation (MR). The goal of this study was to determine clinical characteristics and outcomes in patients with normal LAP undergoing TMVR. METHODS: A single-centre retrospective cohort of consecutive patients who underwent transcatheter edge-to-edge mitral valve clip and continuous LAP monitoring between 5/1/2014 and 5/1/2018 was analysed. One-year mortality was compared by Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Multivariable analysis was performed to identify predictors of normal LAP and 1 year mortality. RESULTS: Of the 204 patients undergoing TMVR, 65% were men and the mean age was 81. Of these patients, 31 (15%) had normal LAP (mean LAP 10.5 mm Hg, mean V wave 16.5 mm Hg) and 173 had elevated LAP (mean LAP 19 mm Hg, mean V wave 32.5 mm Hg). The prevalence of severe MR was not different between groups, although the normal LAP group had significantly lower effective regurgitant orifice area and regurgitant volume. Other notable baseline characteristics including prior cardiac surgery, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, diabetes, congestive heart failure, body mass index, mechanism of MR and ejection fraction were similar between groups. However, there was an increased prevalence of chronic lung disease (CLD) (45.2% vs 17.3%, p<0.001) in the normal LAP group. On multivariate analysis, the only significant predictor of normal LAP was the presence of CLD (OR 4.79 (1.83-12.36), p=0.001) and 1-year mortality was significantly higher in the normal LAP group (32.3% vs 12.7%, p=0.006). After adjustment for comorbidities, normal LAP was no longer a predictor of 1-year mortality (RR 1.62 (0.64-4.06), p=0.32); however, CLD (RR 3.44 (1.37-8.67), p=0.01) remained a statistically significant predictor. CONCLUSION: Normal LAP at the time of TMVR is associated with a higher incidence of CLD which independently predicts increased 1-year mortality. In patients with CLD and apparently severe MR, measurement of LAP may help identify those with lower likelihood of benefit from TMVR.  "
The Gene and Protein Expression of the Main Components of the Lipolytic System in Human Myocardium and Heart Perivascular Adipose Tissue. Effect of Coronary Atherosclerosis.  ;The aim of our study was to examine the regulation of triacylglycerols (TG) metabolism in myocardium and heart perivascular adipose tissue in coronary atherosclerosis. Adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) is the major TG-hydrolase. The enzyme is activated by a protein called comparative gene identification 58 (CGI-58) and inhibited by a protein called G0/G1 switch protein 2 (G0S2). Samples of the right atrial appendage and perivascular adipose tissue were obtained from two groups of patients: 1-with multivessel coronary artery disease qualified for coronary artery bypass grafting (CAD), 2-patients with no atherosclerosis qualified for a valve replacement (NCAD). The mRNA and protein analysis of ATGL, HSL, CGI-58, G0S2, FABP4, FAT/CD36, LPL, β-HAD, CS, COX4/1, FAS, SREBP-1c, GPAT1, COX-2, 15-LO, and NFκβ were determined by using real-time PCR and Western Blot. The level of lipids (i.e., TG, diacylglycerol (DG), and FFA) was examined by GLC. We demonstrated that in myocardium coronary atherosclerosis increases only the transcript level of G0S2 and FABP4. Most importantly, ATGL, β-HAD, and COX4/1 protein expression was reduced and it was accompanied by over double the elevation in TG content in the CAD group. The fatty acid synthesis and their cellular uptake were stable in the myocardium of patients with CAD. Additionally, the expression of proteins contributing to inflammation was increased in the myocardium of patients with coronary stenosis. Finally, in the perivascular adipose tissue, the mRNA of G0S2 was elevated, whereas the protein content of FABP-4 was increased and for COX4/1 diminished. These data suggest that a reduction in ATGL protein expression leads to myocardial steatosis in patients with CAD.  
Salvage heart transplantation for Mycoplasma hominis prosthetic valve endocarditis: A case report and review of the literature.  ;"Heart transplantation (HT) has been rarely performed in patients with infective endocarditis (IE) and is considered a ""last resort"" procedure. Orthotropic HT with bicaval technique was performed in a man with culture-negative endocarditis. Mycoplasma hominis was later detected using 16S ribosomal DNA PCR from surgically removed valve tissue. Literature review and previous results are summarized. HT may be considered as salvage treatment in selected patients with intractable IE. In cases when there is no growth in culture, 16S ribosomal DNA PCR sequencing can be used to identify the pathogen in excised valvular tissue. Mycoplasma spp. is extremely uncommon and difficult to diagnose cause of infective endocarditis (IE). There are no proposed or defined criteria for heart transplantation (HT) in patients with refractory IE, and HT has been rarely performed in this setting. We report a case of M hominis prosthetic valve endocarditis diagnosed by 16S ribosomal DNA PCR in a patient who underwent a salvage HT. We reviewed in the literature other cases of IE caused by Mycoplasma spp.  "
The impact of chronic kidney disease in women undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement: Analysis from the Women's INternational Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (WIN-TAVI) registry.  ;"BACKGROUND: The prevalence of both chronic kidney disease (CKD) and aortic stenosis (AS) increase with age. Although baseline CKD is frequent in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), its significance among women is largely unknown. METHODS: Women's INternational Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (WIN-TAVI) is a multinational, prospective registry of women undergoing TAVR for severe AS. We included patients with available baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and completed 1-year follow-up. Patients were categorized into three groups based on their eGFR: No CKD (normal kidney function to stage 2 CKD: eGFR ≥60 ml/min/1.73 m2 ); (b) mild CKD (stage 3a CKD: eGFR = 45-59 ml/min/1.73 m2 ); and (c) moderate/severe CKD (stage ≥3b CKD: eGFR <45 ml/min/1.73 m2 ). All events were adjudicated according to the Valve Academic Research Consortium (VARC)-2 criteria. RESULT: Out of 852 women undergoing TAVR, 326 (38.3%) had no CKD, 225 (26.4%) had mild CKD, and 301 (35.3%) had moderate/severe CKD. Women with higher stage of CKD at baseline were more likely to have a history of hypertension, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, anemia, chronic lung disease, hemodialysis, prior percutaneous coronary intervention, and pacemaker implantation. After multivariate adjustment, moderate/severe CKD was associated with a greater risk of 1-year VARC-2 safety endpoints [hazard ratio (HR) 1.68, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.10-2.60], all-cause death (HR 2.00, 95% CI: 1.03-3.90), and composite of death, myocardial infarction, stroke or life-threatening bleeding (HR 1.70, 95% CI: 1.04-2.76). There were no differences in 30-day and 1-year VARC-2 efficacy and 30-day VARC-2 safety outcomes. CONCLUSION: CKD is associated with substantial and independent risk for mortality and morbidity at 1-year follow-up in women undergoing TAVR.  "
Highly accelerated, real-time phase-contrast MRI using radial k-space sampling and GROG-GRASP reconstruction: a feasibility study in pediatric patients with congenital heart disease.  ;"Retrospective electrocardiogram-gated, 2D phase-contrast (PC) flow MRI is routinely used in clinical evaluation of valvular/vascular disease in pediatric patients with congenital heart disease (CHD). In patients not requiring general anesthesia, clinical standard PC is conducted with free breathing for several minutes per slice with averaging. In younger patients under general anesthesia, clinical standard PC is conducted with breath-holding. One approach to overcome this limitation is using either navigator gating or self-navigation of respiratory motion, at the expense of lengthening scan times. An alternative approach is using highly accelerated, free-breathing, real-time PC (rt-PC) MRI, which to date has not been evaluated in CHD patients. The purpose of this study was to develop a 38.4-fold accelerated 2D rt-PC pulse sequence using radial k-space sampling and compressed sensing with 1.5 × 1.5 × 6.0 mm3 nominal spatial resolution and 40 ms nominal temporal resolution, and evaluate whether it is capable of accurately measuring flow in 17 pediatric patients (aortic valve, pulmonary valve, right and left pulmonary arteries) compared with clinical standard 2D PC (either breath-hold or free breathing). For clinical translation, we implemented an integrated reconstruction pipeline capable of producing DICOMs of the order of 2 min per time series (46 frames). In terms of association, forward volume, backward volume, regurgitant fraction, and peak velocity at peak systole measured with standard PC and rt-PC were strongly correlated (R2 > 0.76; P < 0.001). Compared with clinical standard PC, in terms of agreement, forward volume (mean difference = 1.4% (3.0% of mean)) and regurgitant fraction (mean difference = -2.5%) were in good agreement, whereas backward volume (mean difference = -1.1 mL (28.2% of mean)) and peak-velocity at peak systole (mean difference = -21.3 cm/s (17.2% of mean)) were underestimated by rt-PC. This study demonstrates that the proposed rt-PC with the said spatial resolution and temporal resolution produces relatively accurate forward volumes and regurgitant fractions but underestimates backward volumes and peak velocities at peak systole in pediatric patients with CHD.

The pathogenic role of coronary microvascular dysfunction in the setting of other cardiac or systemic conditions.  ;Coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD) plays a pathogenic role in cardiac and systemic conditions other than microvascular angina. In this review, we provide an overview of the pathogenic role of CMD in the setting of diabetes mellitus, obesity, hypertensive pregnancy disorders, chronic inflammatory and autoimmune rheumatic disorders, chronic kidney disease, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and aortic valve stenosis. In these various conditions, CMD results from different structural, functional, and/or dynamic alterations in the coronary microcirculation associated with the primary disease process. CMD is often detectable very early in the course of the primary disease, before clinical symptoms or signs of myocardial ischaemia are present, and it portrays an increased risk for cardiovascular events.

Normal imaging findings after aortic valve implantation on (18)F-Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography with computed tomography.  ;BACKGROUND: To determine the normal perivalvular 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) uptake on positron emission tomography (PET) with computed tomography (CT) within one year after aortic prosthetic heart valve (PHV) implantation. METHODS: Patients with uncomplicated aortic PHV implantation were prospectively included and underwent 18F-FDG PET/CT at either 5 (± 1) weeks (group 1), 12 (± 2) weeks (group 2) or 52 (± 8) weeks (group 3) after implantation. 18F-FDG uptake around the PHV was scored qualitatively (none/low/intermediate/high) and quantitatively by measuring the maximum Standardized Uptake Value (SUVmax) and target to background ratio (SUVratio). RESULTS: In total, 37 patients (group 1: n = 12, group 2: n = 12, group 3: n = 13) (mean age 66 ± 8 years) were prospectively included. Perivalvular 18F-FDG uptake was low (8/12 (67%)) and intermediate (4/12 (33%)) in group 1, low (7/12 (58%)) and intermediate (5/12 (42%)) in group 2, and low (8/13 (62%)) and intermediate (5/13 (38%)) in group 3 (P = 0.91). SUVmax was 4.1 ± 0.7, 4.6 ± 0.9 and 3.8 ± 0.7 (mean ± SD, P = 0.08), and SUVratio was 2.0 [1.9 to 2.2], 2.0 [1.8 to 2.6], and 1.9 [1.7 to 2.0] (median [IQR], P = 0.81) for groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. CONCLUSION: Non-infected aortic PHV have similar low to intermediate perivalvular 18F-FDG uptake with similar SUVmax and SUVratio at 5, 12, and 52 weeks after implantation.  
Modified Single Repair Technique for Complete Atrioventricular Septal Defect: A Propensity Score Matching Analysis.  ;There were controversies about the priority of modified single patch (MSP) technique compared with two-patch (TP) technique for patients with complete atrioventricular septal defect (CAVSD). From 2002 to 2013, patients who diagnosed as balanced CAVSD in our institution were retrospectively included. Patients with unbalanced ventricles or associated anomalies were excluded. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality and the secondary endpoint consist of left atrioventricular dysfunction or left atrioventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO). A total of 74 patients underwent MSP repair and 102 patients underwent TP repair. After 1:1 propensity matching, there were 46 Rastelli type A CAVSD patients in each group. Patients in MSP group had shorter cardiopulmonary bypass time [median (interquartile range) 73.5 (65.5-95.0) versus 105.0 (88.8-130.0) min, P < 0.001] and aortic cross-clamp time [105.5 (90.0-128.0) versus 143.0 (122.0-184.0) min, P < 0.001]. In total, the primary endpoint occurred in 12 patients, including 2/46 (4.3%) in MSP group and 10/46 (21.7%) in TP group. That 1-year, 3-year, 5-year survival rate can be calculated as 95.6%, 95.6%, 95.6% in MSP group and 92.6%, 80.4%, 78.2% in TP group, P = 0.015. No significant statistical difference found for the secondary endpoints that 7/46 (15.2%) patients occurred moderate or severe LAVVR in MSP group versus 11/46 (23.9%) patients in TP group, P = 0.293. No LVOTO occurred in both groups. Besides the simplicity of technique, MSP technique may be safer.  
A scoping review and mapping exercise comparing the content of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) across heart disease-specific scales.  ;"BACKGROUND: Over the past decade, the importance of person-centered care has led to increased interest in patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). In cardiovascular care, selecting an appropriate PROM for clinical use or research is challenging because multimorbidity is often common in patients. The aim was therefore to provide an overview of heart-disease specific PROMs and to compare the content of those outcomes using a bio-psycho-social framework of health. METHODS: A scoping review of heart disease-specific PROMs, including arrhythmia/atrial fibrillation, congenital heart disease, heart failure, ischemic heart disease, and valve diseases was conducted in PubMed (January 2018). All items contained in the disease-specific PROMs were mapped to WHO's International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) according to standardized linking rules. RESULTS: A total of 34 PROMs (heart diseases in general n = 5; cardiac arrhythmia n = 6; heart failure n = 14; ischemic heart disease n = 9) and 147 ICF categories were identified. ICF categories covered Body functions (n = 61), Activities & Participation (n = 69), and Environmental factors (n = 17). Most items were about experienced problems of Body functions and less often about patients' daily activities, and most PROMs were specifically developed for heart failure and no PROM were identified for valve disease or congenital heart disease. CONCLUSIONS: Our results motivate and provide information to develop comprehensive PROMs that consider activity and participation by patients with various types of heart disease.  "
Percutaneous mitral commissurotomy versus surgical commissurotomy for rheumatic mitral stenosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials.  ;"AIM: Patients with severe mitral stenosis (MS) and their clinicians typically choose percutaneous transvenous mitral commissurotomy (PTMC) over surgical commissurotomy (SC). However, the durability of PTMC relative to SC is uncertain. We compared the efficacy, safety and durability of PTMC with SC for the treatment of MS. METHODS: We searched EMBASE, MEDLINE and WHO ICTRP registers for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing PTMC, and open and/or closed mitral commissurotomy. The principal outcomes were rate of re-intervention and symptomatic improvement as inferred from the surrogate measures of immediate postprocedural mitral valve area (MVA), MVA at ≥6 month follow-up, incidence of mitral regurgitation (MR) and restenosis. We calculated weighted mean differences (WMD) for continuous outcomes, relative risks (RR) for binary outcomes and pooled outcomes using random-effects models and assessed the quality of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. RESULTS: Seven RCTs with 553 patients proved eligible. Pooled estimates showed no convincing difference in the risk of restenosis or re-intervention (15/100 fewer with PTMC, 95% CI (-20 to +8); quality of evidence: moderate) or in symptoms as inferred from immediate MVA (WMD 0.15, 95% CI (-0.18 to 0.48): very low), from the incidence of postprocedural severe MR (3/100 more with PTMC, 95% CI (-1 to +10): moderate) or from MVA at 30 months. CONCLUSION: Until data demonstrating convincing superiority of SC over PTMC become available, our results support the current practice of recommending PTMC to young patients with MS and favourable valve morphology, as it is associated with lower peri-procedural morbidity.

Incidence, prognosis and predictors of major vascular complications and percutaneous closure device failure following contemporary percutaneous transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve replacement.  ;"OBJECTIVES: To determine the incidence, prognosis, and predictors of major Valve Academic Research Consortium (VARC-2) vascular complications (VCs) and percutaneous vascular closure device failure (PCDF) following contemporary percutaneous transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TF-TAVR). BACKGROUND: Limited data exists on the incidence and predictors of VCs and PCDFs following percutaneous TF-TAVR using contemporary 14-16 French (F) sheaths. METHODS: We recorded clinical and procedural characteristics, computer tomography (CT) angiographic data, 30-day VCs, mortality, and length of stay (LOS) in all consecutive percutaneous TF-TAVRs at a single center from June 2016 to October 2018. CT measures included common femoral artery (CFA) and external iliac artery (EIA) diameters, sheath to CFA and EIA ratios (SFAR and SEIAR), depth of CFA, extent and location of CFA calcification and pelvic vessel tortuosity (2 bends ≥90°). Multivariable regression was used to predict major VCs and percutaneous closure device failure (PCDF), respectively. RESULTS: The final sample consisted of 303 percutaneous TF-TAVRs. Median age was 80 years, 51% were male, 86% Caucasian, 33% had diabetes mellitus (DM) and mean STS score was 5.8 ± 3.8%. Baseline characteristics were similar in patients with vs. without VCs, other than coronary artery disease (CAD) (69% vs. 54%, respectively; p = 0.029) and DM (21% vs. 36%, respectively; p = 0.02). There were 65 (21%) vascular complications: 19 major VCs [6.3%], 29 minor [VCs 9.6%] and 17 PCDFs [5.6%]. Overall, 30-day mortality was low (2.6%). Major VCs were associated with higher mortality (42% vs. 0%, p < 0.0001) while minor VCs (3% vs. 0%, mortality p = 0.99) and PCDFs (3% vs. 0% mortality, p = 0.99) were not. PCDFs were associated with a longer median LOS (4 vs. 3 days, p = 0.02). The independent predictors of major VCs were pelvic vessel tortuosity (OR 3.1; 95% CI 1.1-9.2) and presence of CAD (OR 8.2; 95% CI 1.8-37). Female gender showed a strong trend toward increased risk (OR 3.4; CI 0.84-14; p = 0.086). There were no independent predictors of PCDF. CONCLUSION: Contemporary percutaneous TF-TAVR is associated with a low risk of mortality, major VCs and PCDFs. Major VCs confer increased mortality and PCDFs prolong LOS. Pelvic vessel tortuosity and a history of CAD predict major VCs; there were no predictors of PCDFs. These results provide a contemporary update on the incidence and implications of these important vascular complications in the current era of percutaneous TF-TAVR using 14-16F vascular sheaths.  "
Acute Pulmonary Edema: A Rare Cause of Dyspnea After Electrical Cardioversion.  ;BACKGROUND: Direct current cardioversion is a common management option for termination of tachydysrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. It is generally safe and effective with infrequent reporting of side effects. Pulmonary edema is a rare complication with reported incidence of 1-3% and mortality of 18%. Our literature search did not reveal any reported cases of postcardioversion pulmonary edema in the emergency medicine literature. CASE REPORT: We report a case of an 80-year-old woman with a history of atypical atrial flutter on warfarin, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and rheumatic mitral valve disease who presented with shortness of breath 12 h after transesophageal echocardiography and subsequent direct current cardioversion with reversion to sinus rhythm. She was found to be in acute pulmonary edema. She was placed on noninvasive ventilation and diuresis with eventual symptom resolution. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: Postcardioversion pulmonary edema is a rare complication that may occur after reversion to sinus rhythm. Emergency physicians should be cognizant of patients, especially those with underlying structural heart disease, who present with dyspnea after a recent cardioversion procedure or after cardioversion in the emergency department. Patients cardioverted in the emergency department may be observed for around 3 h and counseled on the development of respiratory symptoms.

Racial and Ethnic Differences in Treatment and Outcomes of Severe Aortic Stenosis: A Review.  ;Aortic stenosis (AS) is among the most common valvular heart diseases encountered in the United States. In this review the authors examine differences between racial and ethnic groups in the epidemiology and management of severe AS, explore potential explanations for these findings, and discuss the implications for improving the delivery of care to racially and ethnically diverse populations. Underrepresented racial and ethnic groups experience a paradoxically lower prevalence or incidence of AS relative to white subjects, despite having a higher prevalence of traditional risk factors. Historically, UREGs with severe AS have had lower rates of both surgical and transcatheter aortic valve replacement and experienced more post-surgical complications, including, bleeding, worsening heart failure, and rehospitalization. Last, UREGs with severe AS have an increased risk for morbidity and mortality relative to white patients. To date much of the research on AS has examined black-white differences, so there is a need to understand how other racial and ethnic groups with severe AS are diagnosed and treated, with examination of their resulting outcomes. Overall, racial and ethnic disparities in health care access and care delivery are a public health concern given the changing demographics of the U.S. population. These differences in AS management and outcomes highlight the need for additional research into contributing factors and appropriate interventions to address the lower rates of aortic valve replacement and higher morbidity and mortality among UREGs.

Differences in Aortopathy in Patients with a Bicuspid Aortic Valve with or without Aortic Coarctation.  ;"OBJECTIVE: The combination of aortic coarctation (CoA) and bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is assumed to be associated with a higher risk of ascending aortic dilatation and type A dissection, and current European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines advise therefore to operate at a lower threshold in the presence of CoA. The aim of our study is to evaluate whether the coexistence of CoA in BAV patients is indeed associated with a higher risk of ascending aortic events (AAE). METHODS: In a retrospective study, all adult BAV patients visiting the outpatient clinic of our tertiary care center between February 2003 and February 2019 were included. The primary end point was an ascending aortic event (AAE) defined as ascending aortic dissection/rupture or preventive surgery. The secondary end points were aortic dilatation and aortic growth. RESULTS: In total, 499 BAV patients (43.7% female, age 40.3 ± 15.7 years) were included, of which 121 (24%) had a history of CoA (cBAV). An aortic event occurred in 38 (7.6%) patients at a mean age of 49.0 ± 13.6 years. In the isolated BAV group (iBAV), significantly more AAE occurred, but this was mainly driven by aortic valve dysfunction as indication for aortic surgery. There was no significant difference in the occurrence of dissection or severely dilated ascending aorta (>50mm) between the iBAV and cBAV patients (p = 0.56). The aortic diameter was significantly smaller in the cBAV group (30.3 ± 6.9 mm versus 35.7 ± 7.6 mm; p < 0.001). The median aortic diameter increase was 0.23 (interquartile range (IQR): 0.0-0.67) mm/year and was not significantly different between both groups (p = 0.74). CONCLUSION: Coexistence of CoA in BAV patients was not associated with a higher risk of aortic dissection, preventive aortic surgery, aortic dilatation, or more rapid aorta growth. This study suggests that CoA is not a risk factor in BAV patients, and the advice to operate at lower diameter should be reevaluated.  "

The Role of Coronary Catheterization with Angiography in Surgically Managed Infectious Endocarditis.  ;"BACKGROUND: Coronary catheterization with angiography is often performed prior to surgical valve replacement in infectious endocarditis. There are no existing data as to whether this intervention is clinically necessary or leads to a change in surgical management. In order to determine the frequency with which coronary angiography impacts surgical management in infectious endocarditis, we conducted a retrospective review of surgically managed endocarditis cases at a tertiary care medical center. METHODS: Utilizing the institutional Society of Thoracic Surgeon's database, we identified 598 patients with surgically managed endocarditis between April 29, 2011 and December 31, 2018. Patient variables were recorded, including risk factors for coronary artery disease, whether the patient received coronary angiography prior to surgery, and if the patient underwent coronary artery bypass grafting as part of their valve surgery. RESULTS: There were 430 patients who received coronary catheterization with angiography prior to surgical valve replacement for infectious endocarditis, and 168 patients proceeded to surgery without coronary angiography. Nine percent of patients underwent coronary artery bypass grafting at the time of valve replacement as a result of coronary angiography findings. There was no significant difference in 30-day mortality for patients with endocarditis who underwent coronary angiography when compared with those who did not receive coronary angiography (2.6 vs 2.4%; P = 0.89). CONCLUSIONS: Left heart catheterization with coronary angiography prior to surgical valve replacement leads to coronary artery bypass grafting in the minority of infective endocarditis patients.  "
Reexamining remodelling in children.  ;OBJECTIVES: Some studies have suggested that root remodelling is unsuitable as valve-sparing aortic root replacement in children because of the increased risk of valve failure. This study reviewed our experience with root remodelling in children. METHODS: All patients who underwent root remodelling at the age of ≤18 years between 1999 and 2016 were evaluated. In 2004, cusp effective height was measured intraoperatively and prolapse was corrected with central plication on the cusp. Suture annuloplasty was introduced after 2009 for annular dilatation. RESULTS: There were 17 consecutive patients. The median age at operation was 14 (2.8-18) years. Aortic valve morphology was tricuspid in 10 patients, bicuspid in 5 patients, unicuspid in 1 patient and a pulmonary autograft in 1 patient. Marfan syndrome, Loeys-Dietz syndrome and other connective tissue diseases were present in 11, 1 and 2 patients, respectively. Five patients had more than moderate aortic regurgitation. The median graft size used for root remodelling was 24 (18-26) mm. Cusp repair and annuloplasty were performed in 15 and 14 patients, respectively. The mean follow-up time was 6.5 ± 4.3 years. One patient with preoperatively severely depressed ventricular function died in the hospital from persistent heart failure. One patient (operated on before 2004) required aortic valve reoperation due to cusp prolapse. One patient with a unicuspid valve had developed moderate aortic regurgitation, and the other 14 patients had mild or less regurgitation. The median diameter of the sinus of Valsalva at the last follow-up was 36 (30-43) mm, Z-score of 1.5 (-3.5 to 3.9). CONCLUSIONS: Root remodelling can be performed in children with favourable results by appropriate cusp repair and annuloplasty.  
Transcatheter aortic valve replacement 24 years after cardiac transplantation.  ;"As patient survival after cardiac transplantation has improved over the course of the last several decades, clinicians are now faced with late complications. This includes aortic stenosis which, traditionally, has been treated with reoperative sternotomy and aortic valve replacement. Transcather aortic valve replacement (TAVR) offers a minimally invasive alternative in this high-risk population. A small but growing number of cases of TAVR after heart transplantation in high-risk patients have been reported in the last 10 years; we now present a case of aortic valve replacement via a transcatheter approach 24 years after cardiac transplantation.

Incidence, Mechanisms, and Predictors of Mean Systolic Gradients ≥20 mm Hg after Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.  ;"There is a significant increase in transvalvular gradients after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in some patients; however, mechanisms underlying the greater than expected gradients are unknown. We sought to determine the incidence and mechanisms of greater than expected gradients post-TAVI. A total of 424 patients who underwent TAVI at our institution between November 2008 and August 2015 and had at least 1 follow-up echocardiogram were included in the study. Greater than expected gradients were defined as mean systolic Doppler gradients ≥20 mm Hg. The primary end-point was incidence and mechanisms of mean systolic Doppler gradients ≥20 mm Hg. A total of 36 (8%) patients had mean systolic Doppler gradients ≥20 mm Hg. The mechanisms of mean systolic Doppler gradients ≥20 mm Hg were: patient prosthesis mismatch in 15 (42%) patients, high cardiac output in 13 (36%), prosthetic and periprosthetic regurgitation in 11 (31%), stenosis in 5 (14%), and multiple mechanisms in 8 (22%). Patients with mean systolic Doppler gradients ≥20 mm Hg had higher cardiac re-hospitalization rate, but no difference in mortality or major cardiovascular events when compared with the normal gradient group. Smaller prosthetic valve size (p <0.0001) and larger body mass index (p = 0.02) were associated with mean systolic Doppler gradients ≥20 mm Hg; warfarin therapy at discharge had no effect on gradients. In conclusion, about 8% patients had mean systolic Doppler gradients ≥20 mm Hg following TAVI, and patient-prosthesis mismatch was the most common mechanism. The mean systolic Doppler gradients ≥20 mm Hg after TAVI are not benign and warrant careful surveillance.  "
Meta-analysis Comparing Direct Oral Anticoagulants Versus Vitamin K Antagonists After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.  ;Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common co-morbidity in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), but whether direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) confer similar safety and efficacy compared with vitamin K antagonist (VKA) remains unclear in this population. The aim of our study was to investigate the safety and efficacy of DOACs compared with VKA in patients undergoing TAVI with concomitant indication of oral anticoagulation. PUBMED and EMBASE were searched through October 2019 for studies comparing DOACs versus VKA in patients undergoing TAVI with indication of oral anticoagulation. The main efficacy outcomes were all-cause mortality and stroke whereas the main safety outcome was major and/or life-threatening bleeding. Our search identified 5 eligible studies including 2,569 patients. Majority of patients had atrial fibrillation as indication of anticoagulation. There were no significant differences in all-cause mortality, major and/or life-threatening bleeding, and stroke in patients treated with DOACs versus VKA (odds ratio [OR] 1.07, 95% confidence interval [CI] [0.73 to 1.57], p = 0.72, OR = 0.85, 95% CI [0.64 to 1.12], p = 0.24, OR 1.52, 95% CI [0.93 to 2.48], p = 0.09, respectively). In conclusion, in patients undergoing TAVI with concomitant indication for oral anticoagulation, all-cause mortality, major and/or life-threatening bleeding, and stroke were similar between DOACs and VKA. Further large scale randomized controlled trials are needed to search the optimal oral anticoagulation regimen in this population.  
Expression Patterns of Circulating MicroRNAs in the Risk Stratification of Bicuspid Aortopathy.  ;OBJECTIVE: Aortic size-based criteria are of limited value in the prediction of aortic events, while most aortic events occur in patients with proximal aortic diameters < 50 mm. Serological biomarkers and especially circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) have been proposed as an elegant tool to improve risk stratification in patients with different aortopathies. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the levels of circulating miRNAs in a surgical cohort of patients presenting with bicuspid aortic valve disease and distinct valvulo-aortic phenotypes. METHODS: We prospectively examined a consecutive cohort of 145 patients referred for aortic valve surgery: (1) Sixty three patients (mean age 47 ± 11 years, 92% male) with bicuspid aortic valve regurgitation and root dilatation (BAV-AR), (2) thirty two patients (mean age 59 ± 11 years, 73% male) with bicuspid aortic valve stenosis (BAV-AS), and (3) fifty patients (mean age 56 ± 14 years, 55% male) with tricuspid aortic valve stenosis and normal aortic root diameters (TAV-AS) who underwent aortic valve+/-proximal aortic surgery at a single institution. MicroRNAs analysis included 11 miRNAs, all published previously in association with aortopathies. Endpoints of our study were (1) correlation between circulating miRNAs and aortic diameter and (2) comparison of circulating miRNAs in distinct valvulo-aortic phenotypes. RESULTS: We found a significant inverse linear correlation between circulating miRNAs levels and proximal aortic diameter in the whole study cohort. The strongest correlation was found for miR-17 (r = -0.42, p < 0.001), miR-20a (r = -0.37, p < 0.001), and miR-106a (r = -0.32, p < 0.001). All miRNAs were significantly downregulated in BAV vs. TAV with normal aortic root dimensions Conclusions: Our data demonstrate a significant inverse correlation between circulating miRNAs levels and the maximal aortic diameter in BAV aortopathy. When comparing miRNAs expression patterns in BAV vs. TAV patients with normal aortic root dimensions, BAV patients showed significant downregulation of analyzed miRNAs as compared to their TAV counterparts. Further multicenter studies in larger cohorts are needed to further validate these results.  
Assessment of Activity of Daily Life in Mucopolysaccharidosis Type II Patients with Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation.  ;The effectiveness of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for mucopolysaccharidosis type II (MPS II, Hunter disease) remains controversial although recent studies have shown HSCT provides more clinical impact. This study aims to evaluate the long-term effectiveness of HSCT using the activity of daily living (ADL) scores in patients with MPS II. Sixty-nine severely affected MPS II patients (19 patients who received HSCT and 50 untreated patients) and 40 attenuated affected patients (five with HSCT and 35 untreated) were investigated by a simplified ADL questionnaire. The frequency of clinical findings and the scores of ADL (verbal, gross motor, and the level of care) were analyzed statistically. The mean age of onset of 19 severely affected patients who received HSCT was 1.40 years ± 1.06, which is not statistically different from that of 50 untreated patients (p = 0.11). Macroglossia, frequent airway infection, hepatosplenomegaly, joint contracture, and sleep apnea were less frequent in the HSCT-treated group of severe MPS II patients. The severe phenotype HSCT treated group reported a statistically significant higher score of verbal function and gross motor function between the ages of 10 and 15 years and a higher level of care score between 10 and 20 years. Patients with the attenuated phenotype showed high ADL scores, and all of five HSCT treated patients reported a lower frequency of frequent airway infection, coarse skin, umbilical/inguinal hernia, hepatosplenomegaly, heart valve disorders, and carpal tunnel. In conclusion, HSCT is effective, resulting in improvements in clinical features and ADL in patients with MPS II. HSCT should be re-reviewed as a therapeutic option for MPS II patients.  
Feasibility and Accuracy of Aortic Valve Calcium Quantification on Computed Tomographic Angiography in Aortic Stenosis.  ;"BACKGROUND: Traditionally, quantification of aortic valve calcium (AVC) has been performed with noncontrast computed tomography (NCCT) using the Agatston method. This study sought to derive and validate a systematic method enabling AVC quantification using computed tomographic angiography (CTA) in patients with aortic stenosis (AS). METHODS: The study included 134 consecutive patients with AS who underwent both NCCT and CTA and were subdivided into derivation (n = 71) and validation cohorts (n = 63). AVC on NCCT (AVCNCCT) was quantified using the Agatston method using the software developed for semiautomatic assessment of coronary calcium. On CTA, the mean contrast attenuation of the aorta in Hounsfield units (AortaHU) and SD was measured in the region of interest at the level of the sinotubular junction. RESULTS: Using an adjusted calcium detection threshold of AortaHU + 2 SD, we calculated AVC on CTA (AVCCTA) using the same software without modifying other variables. Correlation between AVCNCCT and AVCCTA in the derivation cohort was excellent (r = 0.9679; P < .001). We used a linear regression model to derive a formula for predicting AVCCTA that enabled conversion of AVCCTA to AVCDerived (AVCDerived = 1.821 × AVCCTA). Applying this formula in validation cohort, we calculated AVCDerived, which showed excellent agreement with AVCNCCT (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.9648; 95% confidence interval, 0.9427-0.9782). Excellent correlation was also found between categorized AVCNCCT and AVCDerived scores (κ = 0.9044; 95% confidence interval, 0.7989-1.0000), with 95.24% (60 of 63) of scores falling within the same severity category. CONCLUSIONS: AVC quantification on CTA is feasible with high accuracy and reliability and shows excellent agreement with the standard AVCNCCT score. With the systematic approach using ""dynamic thresholds"" being largely independent of the scan acquisition protocol, AVCDerived can potentially replace AVCNCCT, eliminating the need for separate NCCT acquisition solely for AVC quantification.

Mitral Valve Replacement With the 15-mm Mechanical Valve: A 20-Year Multicenter Experience.  ;"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate early and long-term outcomes (mortality and prosthetic valve replacement) after mitral valve replacement with the 15-mm St Jude Medical prosthesis (St Jude Medical, St Paul, MN). METHODS: A multicenter, retrospective cohort study was performed among patients who underwent mitral valve replacement with a 15-mm St Jude Medical Masters prosthesis at 4 congenital cardiac centers in The Netherlands. Operative results were evaluated and echocardiographic data studied at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10 years after surgery. RESULTS: Surgery was performed in 17 infants. Ten patients (59%) were treated in the intensive care unit before surgery; 8 (47%) were on ventilator support. Median age at surgery was 3.2 months (interquartile range [IQR], 1.2-5.6), and median weight was 5.2 kg (IQR 3.9-5.7). There was 1 early cardiac death and 1 late noncardiac death. Median follow-up time was 9.6 years (IQR, 2.4-13.2), including 8 patients with a follow-up more than 10 years. The first prosthetic valve explantation (n = 11) occurred at a median of 2.9 years (IQR, 2.0-5.4). Other reinterventions were permanent pacemaker implantation (n = 3), subaortic stenosis resection (n = 2), and paravalvular leak repair (n = 1). Prosthetic valve gradients increased from a mean of 5.0 mm Hg (at discharge) to a mean of 14.3 mm Hg (at 5-year follow-up). CONCLUSIONS: Mitral valve replacement with the 15-mm prosthesis can safely be performed in infants and even in neonates. Median freedom from prosthesis replacement for outgrowth is 3.5 years. Thromboembolic complications were rare.  "

[Cardiology].  ;In 2019, the guidelines on the new entity « chronic coronary syndrome » have been published. They influence importantly the work-up and treatment of patients with stable coronary artery disease. We will also report on publications showing the benefit of percutaneous aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in patients with aortic stenosis and low risk surgical risk. With regard to infectious endocarditis, we elucidate the importance of the vegetation's size for predicting mortality and the prognostic value of the positron emission tomography in predicting septic embolism. We highlight the spectacular results of the DAPA-HF study in patients with heart failure and review publications showing the important role of the detection of myocardial fibrosis and scar by cardiac MRI for risk stratification of sudden cardiac death.  
Contemporary Trends and Outcomes of Percutaneous and Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement in Patients With Cancer.  ;"Background Patients with cancer and severe aortic stenosis are often ineligible for surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). Patients with cancer may likely benefit from emerging transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), given its minimally invasive nature. Methods and Results The US-based National Inpatient Sample was queried between 2012 and 2015 using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), codes to identify all hospitalized adults (aged ≥50 years), who had a primary diagnosis of aortic stenosis. We examined the effect modification of cancer on the relative use rate, outcomes, and dispositions associated with propensity-matched cohort TAVR versus SAVR. Overall, 47 295 TAVRs (22.6% comorbid cancer) and 113 405 SAVRs (15.2% comorbid cancer) were performed among admissions with aortic stenosis between 2012 and 2015. In the year 2015, patients with cancer saw relatively higher rates of TAVR use compared with SAVR (relative use rateTAVR versus relative use rateSAVR, 67.8% versus 57.2%; P<0.0001). Among patients with cancer, TAVR was associated with lower odds of acute kidney injury (odds ratio, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.54-0.75) and major bleeding (odds ratio, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.38-0.51]), with no differences in in-hospital mortality and stroke compared with SAVR. In addition, TAVR was associated with higher odds of home discharge (odds ratio, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.68-2.19) compared with SAVR among patients with cancer. Lower risk of acute kidney injury was noted in cancer versus noncancer (P<0.001) undergoing TAVR versus SAVR in effect modification analysis. Conclusions TAVR use has increased irrespective of cancer status, with a greater increase in cancer versus noncancer. In patients with cancer, there was an association of TAVR with lower periprocedural complications and better disposition when compared with patients undergoing SAVR.  "

A Validation Study: How Predictive Is a Diagnostic Coding Algorithm at Identifying Rheumatic Heart Disease in Western Australian Hospital Data?  ;BACKGROUND: International Classification of Diseases codes for rheumatic heart disease (RHD) (ICD-10 I05-I08) include valvular heart disease of unspecified origin, limiting their usefulness for estimating RHD burden. An expert opinion-based algorithm was developed to increase their accuracy for epidemiological case ascertainment. The algorithm included codes not defaulting to RHD ('probable') plus selected codes pertaining to mitral valve involvement in patients <60 years ('possible'). We aimed to determine the positive predictive value (PPV) for RHD of algorithm-selected hospital admissions. METHODS: Chart reviews of RHD-coded admissions (n=368) to Western Australian tertiary hospitals (2009-2016) authenticated RHD diagnosis. We selected all cases with algorithm-positive codes from populations at high-risk of RHD and an age-stratified random sample from low-risk groups. RHD status was determined from echocardiographic reports or clinical diagnosis in charts. PPVs were compared by population risk status (high-risk/low-risk), age group, gender, principal/secondary diagnosis and probable/possible codes. RESULTS: High-risk patients had higher PPVs than low-risk patients (83.8% vs 54.9%, p<0.0001). PPVs were 91.5% and 51.5% respectively for algorithm-defined 'probable RHD' and 'possible' codes (p<0.0001). The PPVs in low-risk patients were higher for principal diagnoses than secondary diagnoses (84.5% vs 44.8%, weighted p<0.0001) but were similar in high-risk patients (92.5% vs 81.7%, p=0.096). CONCLUSION: The algorithm performs well for RHD coded as a principal diagnosis, 'probable' codes or in populations at high risk of RHD. Refinement is needed for identifying true RHD in low-risk groups.  
Impact of Malnutrition on Outcomes Following Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (from a National Cohort).  ;Malnutrition is associated with increased mortality in open cardiac surgery, but its impact on transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is unknown. This study utilized the National Readmissions Database to evaluate the impact of malnutrition on mortality, complications, length of stay (LOS), 30-day readmission, and total charges following TAVI. Adult patients undergoing isolated TAVI for severe aortic stenosis were identified using the 2011 to 2016 National Readmissions Database, which accounts for 56.6% of all US hospitalizations. The malnourished cohort included patients with nutritional neglect, cachexia, protein calorie malnutrition, postsurgical nonabsorption, weight loss, and underweight status. Multivariable models were utilized to evaluate the impact of malnutrition on selected outcomes. Of 105,603 patients, 5,280 (5%) were malnourished. Malnourished patients experienced greater mortality (10.4% vs 2.2%, p <0.001), postoperative complications (49.2% vs 22.6%, p <0.001), 30-day readmission rates (21.4 vs 14.9%, p <0.001), index hospitalization charges ($331,637 vs $208,082, p <0.001), and LOS (16.4 vs 6.2 days, p <0.001) relative to their nourished counterparts. On multivariable analysis, malnutrition remained a significant, independent predictor of increased index mortality (Adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 2.68, p <0.001), complications (AOR = 2.09, p <0.001), and 30-day readmission rates (AOR = 1.34, p <0.001). Malnutrition was most significantly associated with infectious complications at index hospitalization (AOR = 3.88, p <0.001) and at 30-day readmission (AOR = 1.43, p <0.027). In conclusion, malnutrition is independently associated with increased mortality, complications, readmission, and resource utilization in patients undergoing TAVI. Preoperative risk stratification and malnutrition modification may improve outcomes in this vulnerable population.  
Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation With the Third Generation Balloon-Expandable Bioprosthesis in Patients With Severe Landing Zone Calcium.  ;"Device success of earlier generation balloon-expandable transcatheter heart valves (BE-THV) is lower in patients with severe landing zone calcium (LZC). We sought to explore the impact of LZC on the outcome of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) with the next generation Edwards Sapien 3 BE-THV. In the present study, severe LZC was defined as severe aortic valve cusp calcium (AVC) and/or left ventricular outflow tract calcium (LVOTC) on computed tomography. Patients who underwent TAVI for pure/predominant aortic regurgitation, bicuspid aortic valve disease, or failed bioprosthetic valve were excluded. Out of 350 patients who underwent TAVI with the Edwards Sapien 3 (age 80.7 ± 6.1, female: 45.1%, Society of Thoracic Surgeons score: 4.9 ± 3.8, transfemoral: 97.4%), 106 (30.3%) had severe LZC; 78 severe AVC (22.3%) and 49 severe LVOTC (14.0%). Severe LZC was associated with lower device success (96.2% vs 100%, p = 0.008) driven by more prosthetic valve regurgitation (PVR, p = 0.008). On multivariable analysis, PVR was associated with severe LVOTC (odds ratio [95% confidence interval] 2.130 [1.092 to 4.158]) but not with severe AVC (1.529 [0.835 to 2.800]). Balloon predilatation (BPreD) was performed in 42.5% of patients with severe LZC (vs 19.3% in nonsevere LZC; p <0.001) and was associated with prolonged procedural time (p = 0.001) and higher irradiation exposure (p = 0.027). Device success (p = 0.311), major procedural complications (p = 0.132), 30-day safety end point (p = 0.815), and PVR (p = 0.684) were not significantly different between patients with severe LZC who underwent BPreD versus direct TAVI. In conclusion, device success of the third generation BE-THV is lower in severe LZC driven by more PVR, especially in patients with severe LVOTC. In those patients, BPreD prolonged the procedure without improving THV performance.  "
Presentation and management of calcific mitral valve disease.  ;"Little is known about the prevalence, presentation and management of calcific mitral valve disease (CMVD). We identified 167 patients (80 ± 10 years; 79% women) with significant CMVD undergoing transthoracic echocardiography at our institution in 2016. Patients presented with significant co-morbidities, 47% had moderate/severe mitral stenosis, 38% had 3+/4+ mitral regurgitation and 15% had a combination of both. Fifty-eight percent were symptomatic. Most symptomatic patients were managed conservatively and incurred higher mortality and mortality/heart failure admission rates than those managed surgically. These data highlight the importance of gaining mechanistic insights into CMVD to prevent its occurrence and avoid the need for high-risk surgery, which is seldom performed in contemporary practice.

A novel TAB2 nonsense mutation (p.S149X) causing autosomal dominant congenital heart defects: a case report of a Chinese family.  ;"BACKGROUND: TAB2 is an activator of MAP 3 K7/TAK1, which is required for the IL-1 induced signal pathway. Microdeletions encompassing TAB2 have been detected in various patients with congenital heart defects (CHD), indicating that haploinsufficiency of TAB2 causes CHD. To date, seven variants within TAB2 were reported associated with CHD, only two of them are nonsense mutations. CASE PRESENTATION: Here we describe a three-generation Chinese family that included five CHD patients with heart valvular defects, such as mitral or tricuspid valves prolapse or regurgitation, and aortic valve stenosis or regurgitation. Our proband was a pregnant woman presenting with mitral, tricuspid, and aortic defects; her first child experienced sudden cardiac death at the age of 2 years. Whole-exome sequencing of the proband revealed a novel nonsense variant in TAB2 (c.C446G, p.S149X), which results in the elimination of the majority of C-terminal amino acids of TAB2, including the critical TAK1-binding domain. The variant was identified in five affected patients but not in the eight unaffected family members using Sanger sequencing and was classified as ""pathogenic"" according to the latest recommendation on sequence variants laid out by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology. CONCLUSION: We described a family with CHD caused by a novel TAB2 nonsense mutation. Our study broadens the mutation spectrum of TAB2; to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a pathogenic mutation within TAB2 in a Chinese population.  "
Impact of Right Ventricular Systolic Dysfunction on Outcome in Aortic Stenosis.  ;"BACKGROUND: Pulmonary hypertension is an established outcome predictor in patients with aortic stenosis (AS), but the prognostic impact of right ventricular dysfunction has not been well studied. METHODS: We included 2181 patients (50.4% men; mean age, 77 years) with aortic valve area <1.3 cm2 and analyzed the occurrence of all-cause death during follow-up according to tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) quartiles. RESULTS: Patients in the lowest quartile (TAPSE <17 mm) were at a high risk of death, whereas survival was comparable for the 3 other quartiles. Five-year survival was 55±2% for TAPSE <17 mm, 72±2% for TAPSE of 17 to 20 mm, 71±2% for TAPSE of 20 to 24 mm, and 73±2% for TAPSE >24 mm (overall P<0.001). TAPSE <17 mm was associated with increased mortality after adjustment for established prognostic factors (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.55 [95% CI, 1.21-1.97]) and after further adjustment for aortic valve replacement (AVR; adjusted HR, 1.47 [95% CI, 1.15-1.87]). The excess mortality risk associated with TAPSE <17 mm was noticed in both patients managed initially conservatively (adjusted HR, 1.46 [95% CI, 1.20-1.76]) and patients who underwent early (within 3 months after diagnosis) AVR (adjusted HR, 1.61 [95% CI, 1.03-2.52]). In asymptomatic patients with severe AS and preserved ejection fraction, TAPSE <17 mm was independently predictive of mortality (adjusted HR, 2.14 [95% CI, 1.31-3.51]). Early AVR was associated with similar survival benefit in TAPSE <17 and ≥17 mm (adjusted HR, 0.23 [95% CI, 0.16-0.34] for TAPSE <17 mm, adjusted HR, 0.26 [95% CI, 0.19-0.35] for TAPSE ≥17 mm; P for interaction, 0.97). CONCLUSIONS: Right ventricular dysfunction is an important and independent predictor of mortality in AS. TAPSE <17 mm at the time of AS diagnosis is a marker of poor survival under conservative management and after AVR even in asymptomatic patients with severe AS. AVR was associated with a pronounced reduction in mortality independent of TAPSE suggesting that AVR should be discussed before right ventricular dysfunction occurs in severe AS.  "

Cardiac wall motion abnormality as a predictor for undetermined stroke with embolic lesion-pattern.  ;OBJECTIVES: Several strokes of potential embolism do not clearly meet the definitions of embolic stroke with unknown source, cryptogenic stroke, or cardioembolic (CE) stroke. Considering the high mortality and recurrence of CE strokes, it is very important to detect treatable cardiac sources of embolism. Although regional wall motion abnormality (RWMA) of the left ventricle (LV) seems to be related to CE stroke, association between cerebral embolic risk and RWMA remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of RWMA on undetermined stroke with embolic lesion-pattern (USELP). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Among a total of 2327 patients with acute ischemic stroke, we excluded 148 patients without a transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). According to a stepwise approach, we excluded patients without an embolic lesion-pattern. Finally, we divided patients into two groups (USELP, 119, and non-embolic stroke, 1237). We classified patients' RWMAs into three major arterial territories according to the standard 17-segment model of TTE. RESULTS: Among the included 1356 patients, those with USELP had larger internal dimension at diastole and systole in LV, reduced LV ejection fraction, increased E/A ratios, mitral valve disease, and RWMA. After adjusting for multiple variables, binary logistic regression revealed that RWMA was significantly associated with USELP (OR 7.02, 95 % CI: 3.51-14.01, p<0.001). CONCLUSION: This study provides significant information to support that RWMA can be a predictor for undetermined embolic stroke. In this regard, RWMA were highly correlated with patients whose imaging supported an embolic source compared to those without this radiographic pattern.  
Surgical Repair of Peripheral Pulmonary Artery Stenosis in Patients Without Williams or Alagille Syndromes.  ;Peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis is a relatively rare form of congenital heart disease typically associated with genetic syndromes, such as Williams or Alagille syndromes. However, some patients present with severe stenosis without associated syndromes. The purpose of the study was to review our surgical experience in such patients. This was a retrospective review of 30 patients who underwent surgical repair for peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis. Concomitant anatomical diagnoses in 20 patients (67%) included supravalvar aortic stenosis (n = 8), tetralogy of Fallot (n = 4), d-transposition of the great arteries (n = 2), truncus arteriosus (n = 2), hypoplastic left heart syndrome (n = 2), ventricular septal defect (n = 1), and patent ductus arteriosus (n = 1). Additional medical diagnoses in 15 patients (50%) included elastin arteriopathy (n = 9), pulmonary artery calcinosis (n = 1), arterial tortuosity syndrome (n = 1), DiGeorge syndrome (n = 1), and Noonan syndrome (n = 1). Median age at surgery was 3.6 years (interquartile range 1.6-7.4 years). Seventeen patients (57%) had prior cardiac operations, and 16 patients (53%) previously underwent percutaneous intervention. With surgery, mean right ventricle-to-aortic systolic pressure ratio decreased from 0.95 ± 0.2 to 0.28 ± 0.08 (P< 0.0001). Median duration of cardiopulmonary bypass was 369 minutes. There was 100% survival to hospital discharge, with no mortality at mean follow-up of 2.3 years. No patient required reoperation, while 4 underwent balloon dilation. Freedom from pulmonary artery catheter-based reintervention was 95% and 80% at 12 and 36 months, respectively. Patients with peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis without either Williams or Alagille syndrome can successfully undergo surgical repair with a significant reduction in right ventricle-to-aortic pressure ratios.

Complete percutaneous apical access and closure: Short and intermediate term outcomes.  ;OBJECTIVES: To examine the safety of utilizing transapical access during structural interventions. BACKGROUND: Complex interventions of the mitral or aortic region sometimes require coaxial forces to orient and deliver devices. Apical access can provide coaxial countertraction for either transseptal or retrograde aortic access. This manuscript describes the single center experience of small bore transapical access. METHODS: Retrospective review of cases from 2013 to 2018 at Henry Ford Hospital was performed. Patient demographics and procedure characteristics were abstracted to describe the safety of transapical access using small bore sheaths. RESULTS: A total 21 cases were performed at Henry Ford, most of them for transcatheter mitral valve replacement (81%). The mean sheath size used was 4.7 ± 0.9 Fr and protamine was used at the end of 57% of cases. All patients received nitinol-based plugs, 80.1% were from the Amplatz Duct Occluder II type. Four major complications related apical puncture occurred, two pericardial effusions, two hemothorax. Over a median follow time of 430 days (IQR 50-652) a total of five deaths occurred, two related to the procedure and three late deaths with a median time of 362 days (range 205-628 days). No deaths were associated with transapical access. Echocardiographic follow up did not detect any late structural complications from occluder devices. CONCLUSIONS: Transapical access and closure with nitinol-based devices is feasible and facilitates complex interventions where coaxial forces are need for device delivery and alignment. The most common complication is bleeding and this should be kept in perspective when treating high-risk patients.

[Long-term Benefit of Aortic Valve Repair].  ;Long-term results of valve repair for aortic regurgitation is not still clear. We investigated retrospectively our results of aortic valve repair for 244 patients. There were 2 operative death and 7 late cardiac death. Ten-year late survival rate was 84% and 10-year reoperation free rate was 74%.That of congenital group was 57%.However, 10-year reoperation rate was 87% for Type 1 group and 79% for Type 2 group. Recent technical evolution such as introduction of 4-dimensional computed tomography (CT) and intraoperative measurement of effective height may contribute improvement of repair technique. Further accumulation of evidence will promote earlier surgery for patients with aortic regurgitation.  
[Standardization of Valve-sparing Aortic Root Replacement Operation Using Aortic Root Remodeling Procedure Combined with External Suture Annuloplasty].  ;The natural prognosis of patients with aortic regurgitation (AR) has proved to be poorer than one might expect, thus surgical intervention should be recommended earlier than before. The most of patients with AR are relatively younger and therefore may benefit from aortic valvuloplasty (AVP) to eliminate prosthesis-related late adverse events. However, AVP does not seem popular enough because long-term durability after AVP is still unclear. For this purpose, long-term outcomes after AVP should be improved by standardizing the procedure, especially using aortic root remodeling procedure combined with external suture annuloplasty. The detail of the standardization of these procedures is outlined in this review briefly. We hope more and more aortic valves of the patients with not only aortic root dilatation but also isolated AR will be preserved based on this review in the near future.  
"[Residual Mitral Regurgitation after Repair for Posterior Leaflet Prolapse;Importance of Preoperative Anterior Leaflet Tethering].  ";BACKGROUND: Carpentier's techniques for degenerative posterior mitral leaflet (PML) prolapse have been established with excellent long-term results reported. However, residual mitral regurgitation( MR) occasionally occurs even after a straightforward repair, though the involved mechanisms are not fully understood. We sought to identify specific preoperative echocardiographic findings associated with residual MR after a PML repair. METHODS AND RESULTS: We retrospectively studied 117 consecutive patients who underwent a primary mitral valve repair for isolated PML prolapse including a preoperative three-dimensional ransesophageal echocardiography( 3D-TEE) examination. Eleven had residual MR after the initial repair, of whom 7 required a corrective second pump run, 4 underwent conversion to mitral valve replacement, and 1 developed moderate MR within 1 month. Their preoperative parameters were compared with those of 105 patients who had an uneventful mitral valve repair. There were no hospital deaths. Multivariate analysis identified preoperative anterior mitral leaflet (AML) tethering angle as a significant predictor for residual MR [odds ratio (OR) 6.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.8~33.8, p=0.0049]. Receiver operator characteristics curve analysis revealed a cut-off value of 24.3°( area under the curve 0.77), indicating that AML angle predicts residual MR. In multivariate regression analysis, smaller anteroposterior mitral annular diameter( p<0.001) and lower left ventricular ejection fraction( p=0.002) were significantly associated with higher AML angle, while left ventricular and left atrial dimension had no significant correlation. CONCLUSIONS: AML tethering in cases of PML prolapse has an adverse impact on early results following mitral valve repair. The findings of preoperative 3D-TEE are important for consideration of a careful surgical strategy.  
[Functional Mitral Stenosis after Mitral Valve Repair for Degenerative Mitral Valve Regurgitation].  ;Functional mitral stenosis after mitral valve repair for degenerative mitral regurgitation( DMR) is an evolving concept. Mitral annuloplasty devices stabilize the mitral annulus, reduce leaflet stress and increase leaflet coaptation, which leads to improvement of repair durability at the cost of dynamic and physiological annular movement and diastolic annular area. An elevation in rest and peak transmitral gradient has been observed in some patients with annuloplasty devices, and this elevation may associate with worse prognosis as late atrial fibrillation or lower functional capacity after surgery. In this review, we summarize the current reports describing functional mitral stenosis after mitral valve repair for DMR.  
[Dual Repair for Ischemic/Functional Mitral Regurgitation].  ;"In the era of M-clip, surgery for ischemic/functional mitral regurgitation( FMR) which is a ventricular disease remains a challenge. We try to do ventricular treatment as much as possible. We reviewed 11 patients( 9 males, 63±12 years old) who had ""dual repair"" surgery which consists of anterior relocation of both papillary heads/muscles and simplified ventricular restoration (frozen-apex restoration). There was 1 hospital death of mesenteric ischemia in a 80 years old patient with sarcoidosis and chronic kidney disease(CKD). FMR changed from 2.7±0.9 preoperatively to 0.9±0.5( p<0.001) postoperatively. Similarly, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class from 3.7±0.8 to 1.8±0.6 (p<0.001), left ventricular end-diastolic dimension (LVDd) from 72±12 to 67±12 mm (p<0.01), end-systolic dimension (Ds) from 65±12 to 59±14 mm (p<0.01), ejection fraction (EF) from 23±8 to 28±10 (p=0.04), and right ventricular pressure( RVP) from 38±13 to 31±8 mmHg. There was no late death with the follow-up of 20±15 months (range 2∼42 months). In conclusion, ventricular treatment by ""dual repair"" surgery helps patients with FMR. Surgery may be a good compensatory treatment for catheter intervention.  "
[Repair for Atrial Functional Regurgitation of Atrio-ventricular Valves].  ;Persistent atrial fibrillation sometimes causes atrial enlargement. In such patients, regurgitation of mitral valve and tricuspid valve would be developed due to the enlargement of annulus of the atrio-ventricular valves. This mechanism of the mitral regurgitation is recently recognized as the atriogenic tethering of the posterior leaflet. Annuloplasty with ring is essential for the surgery in all patients. In the patients with giant left atrium, the annulus is tremendously enlarged. In such patients, we applied patch-augmentation of the posterior leaflet with autologous pericardial patch. Tricuspid annular dilatation is co-existed in these patients, so tricuspid annuloplasty should be done simultaneously. There is no guideline for the treatment of this pathology, so the indication for surgery should be argued.  
[Mitral Valve Plasty in Active Infective Endocarditis].  ;"According to the current guideline, early surgery is recommended in patients with infective endocarditis (IE). On the other hand, mitral valve plasty (MVP) became the preferred surgical option in patients with IE, because of its benefits in the preservation of left ventricular function and prevention of recurrence of infection. Feasibility of MVP is an important issue in surgical strategy, however, it might be associated with the timing of the operation:feasibility of MVP might be higher in healed IE than active IE, although there had been no clear evidence in previous studies. In order to develop scoring system to predict feasibility of MVP in patients with active IE, we have introduced ""severity score"".Severity score defined as the sum of valvular score which evaluates the extensiveness of the valvular destruction, and technical score which evaluates the complexity and durability of the repair. Probability of feasible MVP was high in severity score≤7 points and low in severity score≥9 points. MVP is basically selected in patients with severity score of 8 points, taking the benefit of patients and risks of longterm durability into consideration. We believe that severity score is valuable and reproducible scoring system in surgical decision making.  "
Meta-Analysis of the Impact of Pre-Procedural Serum Albumin on Mortality in Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.  ;"Pre-procedural serum albumin's impact on prognosis after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has been studied. Literature on the prognostic role of serum albumin in the survival of patients undergoing TAVR shows conflicting results. This meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the impact of pre-procedural serum albumin on outcomes after TAVR. A comprehensive literature search of EMBASE, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Library was undertaken through July 2019. The primary end points were 30-day and one-year all-cause mortality after TAVR. Risk ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using the random-effect model. Ten eligible studies with 8,236 patients were analyzed. Of the 8,236 patients undergoing TAVR, with a mean age of 83 years, 48.8% were men and were categorized into two groups according to low and normal serum albumin (cut-off value: 3.5 or 4 g/dL). Overall, low albumin was significantly associated with an approximately two-fold increase in 30-day all-cause mortality (HR, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.53-2.86) and a 61% increase risk for one-year mortality (HR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.31-1.98) in patients after TAVR. Sensitivity analyses showed the results to be robust. The association of low albumin level with an increase in one-year mortality risk was not modified by study design, albumin cut-off value, Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk of Mortality (STS-PROM), and study quality. In conclusion, low albumin levels were associated with poor prognosis in patients after TAVR. Pre-procedural albumin can be used as a simple tool related to prognosis after TAVR.  "
Perioperative Outcomes of Adjunctive Hypnotherapy Compared with Conscious Sedation Alone for Patients Undergoing Transfemoral Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.  ;"Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) using a transfemoral approach under local anesthesia with conscious sedation (LACS) is becoming an increasingly common TAVI strategy. However, patients who are awake during the TAVI procedure can experience stress, anxiety, and pain, even when LACS is used. Clinical hypnotherapy is an anxiolytic intervention that can be beneficial for patients undergoing invasive surgery. This study aimed to assess the perioperative outcomes of adjunctive hypnotherapy undergoing transfemoral TAVI with LACS.Consecutive patients (n = 143) with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis who underwent transfemoral TAVI with LACS only (n = 107) or with LACS and hypnotherapy (n = 36) between January 2015 and April 2016 were retrospectively included in the study. The clinical outcomes were compared between the two groups. The LACS with hypnotherapy group had a significantly shorter length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU; LACS only versus LACS with hypnotherapy: 4.0 (4.0-5.5) days versus 3.0 (3.0-5.0) days, P < 0.01). Moreover, the use of anesthetics (propofol and remifentanil) and norepinephrine was significantly lower in the LACS with hypnotherapy group (e.g., for propofol, LACS only versus LACS with hypnotherapy: 96.4 ± 104.7 mg versus 15.0 ± 31.8 mg, P < 0.001). The multiple regression analysis showed that being male, hypnotherapy, and the composite complication score were independently associated with the length of stay in the ICU.The adjunctive hypnotherapy on LACS among transfemoral TAVI patients may facilitate perioperative management. However, a prospective randomized study is necessary to confirm the efficacy of hypnotherapy among TAVI patients.  "
Long-Term Performance of Right Ventricular Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator Leads in Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy and Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy.  ;"Patients with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) implanted with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) may show a large decrease in R-wave amplitude during long-term follow-up. However, it is unclear whether this decrease is higher in these patients than in those without structural heart disease. This study investigated ICD-lead intracardiac parameters over a long duration in patients with ARVC and HCM and compared these parameters with those of a control group. We included 50 patients (mean age, 55.2 ± 17.2 years; 26% female) with ICD leads in the right ventricular apex, and compared 7 ARVC and 14 HCM patients with 29 control patients without structural heart disease. ICD-lead parameters, including R-wave amplitude, pacing threshold, and impedance during follow-up, were compared. The difference in these parameters between the time of implantation and year 5 were also compared. There were no significant differences in R-wave amplitude at implantation among the 3 groups. The change in R-wave amplitude between the time of implantation and year 5 was significantly greater in the ARVC group (-3.3 ± 5.4 mV, P = 0.012) in comparison to the control group (1.3 ± 2.8 mV); the HCM group showed no significant difference (-0.4 ± 2.3 mV, P = 0.06). Thus, in the ARVC group, R-wave amplitude at year 5 was significantly lower than that in the control group (5.7 ± 4.8 mV versus 12.5 ± 4.5 mV, P = 0.001). In ARVC patients with ICDs, ventricular sensing is likely to deteriorate during long-term follow-up; however, in HCM patients, sensing may not deteriorate.  "
A Long-Term Complication Occurred After Transcatheter Closure of Large Atrial Septal Defect.  ;Transcatheter closure of ostium secondum atrial septal defect has become an alternative method to surgical closure. However, the incidence of complications and long-term results of using large size (> 40 mm) Amplatzer septal occluders are unknown. This case reported a 59 years old woman, whom received transcatheter closure of atrial septal defect (36 mm) with a 40 mm Amplatzer septal occluder 10 years ago and was diagnosed with heart failure. Transthroacic echocardiography showed severe mitral valve regurgitation. Intra-operatively, we confirmed and removed the large device, but we found that the mitral annulus was badly damaged. Mitral valve replacement was performed. We believe large size devices need to be implanted cautiously, especially for the large defect with insufficient rims, and also routinely follow-up is necessary.  
Late infective endocarditis after transcatheter tricuspid valve-in-valve implantation: A pediatric case report.  ;In patients with congenital heart diseases, new procedures, such as transcatheter valve replacement, have been associated with a non-negligible incidence of infective endocarditis (IE): up to 4% patient-year IE incidence. Prosthetic IE after percutaneous tricuspid valve replacement (PTVR) has been scarcely reported. We report the first pediatric case of IE after percutaneous tricuspid Melody™ valve-in-valve implantation in a boy who was diagnosed with Eisenmenger syndrome, related to patent ductus arteriosus. This first pediatric case of late IE (4 years) after PTVR is added to eight previously reported cases of IE from the valve-in-valve international database registry (VIVID registry).

Mitral valve flattening and parameter mapping for patient-specific valve diagnosis.  ;PURPOSE: Intensive planning and analysis from echocardiography are a crucial step before reconstructive surgeries are applied to malfunctioning mitral valves. Volume visualizations of echocardiographic data are often used in clinical routine. However, they lack a clear visualization of the crucial factors for decision making. METHODS: We build upon patient-specific mitral valve surface models segmented from echocardiography that represent the valve's geometry, but suffer from self-occlusions due to complex 3D shape. We transfer these to 2D maps by unfolding their geometry, resulting in a novel 2D representation that maintains anatomical resemblance to the 3D geometry. It can be visualized together with color mappings and presented to physicians to diagnose the pathology in one gaze without the need for further scene interaction. Furthermore, it facilitates the computation of a Pathology Score, which can be used for diagnosis support. RESULTS: Quality and effectiveness of the proposed methods were evaluated through a user survey conducted with domain experts. We assessed pathology detection accuracy using 3D valve models in comparison with the novel visualizations. Classification accuracy increased by 5.3% across all tested valves and by 10.0% for prolapsed valves. Further, the participants' understanding of the relation between 3D and 2D views was evaluated. The Pathology Score is found to have potential to support discriminating pathologic valves from normal valves. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, our survey shows that pathology detection can be improved in comparison with simple 3D surface visualizations of the mitral valve. The correspondence between the 2D and 3D representations is comprehensible, and color-coded pathophysiological magnitudes further support the clinical assessment.

Minimally Invasive Redo Aortic Valve Replacement: Results From a Multicentric Registry (SURD-IR).  ;"BACKGROUND: Reoperation for aortic valve replacement can be challenging and is usually associated with an increased risk for complications and mortality. The study aim was to report the results of a multicenter cohort of patients who underwent minimally invasive reoperative aortic valve replacement with a sutureless or rapid-deployment prosthesis. METHODS: From 2007 to 2018 data from 3651 patients were retrospectively collected from the Sutureless and Rapid-Deployment Aortic Valve Replacement International Registry. Of them, 63 patients who had previously undergone cardiac surgery represented the study population. In-hospital clinical and echocardiographic outcomes were recorded. RESULTS: Mean age of the selected 63 patients was 75.3 ± 7.8 years and logistic EuroSCORE 10.1. Surgery was performed by ministernotomy in 43 patients (68.3%) and by anterior right thoracotomy in 20 (31.7%); 31 patients (49.2%) received the Perceval valve (Livanova PLC, London, UK) and 32 (50.8%) the Intuity valve (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA). Mean cross-clamp time was 57.8 ± 23.2 minutes and cardiopulmonary bypass time 95.0 ± 34.3 minutes. Neither conversion to full sternotomy nor in-hospital deaths occurred. Postoperative events were ischemic cerebral events in 3 patients (4.8%), need for pacemaker implantation in 2 (3.6%), bleeding requiring reoperation in 5 (8.9%), and dialysis in 1 (1.6%). Median intensive care unit stay was 1 day, and median length of hospital stay was 10 days. On echocardiographic evaluation 1 patient showed a significant postoperative aortic regurgitation. CONCLUSIONS: Minimally invasive reoperative aortic valve replacement with a sutureless or rapid-deployment prosthesis is a safe and feasible treatment strategy, resulting in fast recovery and improved postoperative outcome with no mortality and an acceptable complication rate.

Impact of Coronary Artery Severity and Revascularization Prior to Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.  ;The prevalence of coexisting coronary artery disease (CAD) is high in patients who underwent transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). Our objective was to first determine if the severity of CAD before TAVI had an important impact on post-TAVI outcomes and second, if revascularization with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) before TAVI modified this relation. In this retrospective population-based study in Ontario, Canada, we identified all patients with obstructive CAD who underwent TAVI from April 1, 2012 to March 31, 2017. Our primary outcomes of interest were all-cause mortality within 30-day and 1-year post-TAVI procedure. Secondary outcomes included 30-day and 1-year all-cause readmissions. We developed multivariable Cox proportional hazard models, with a robust sandwich-type variance estimator to account for clustering within TAVI centers. These models included an interaction term between severity of CAD and PCI before TAVI. The study cohort included 888 of whom 444 (50%) patients underwent PCI before TAVI procedure. In the Cox models, we found that severity of CAD before TAVI was not significantly associated with post-TAVI outcomes. The only exception was 1 to 2 vessel/s disease which was a significant predictor of 1-year readmission. Pre-TAVI PCI was not significantly associated with outcomes, nor did it modify the relation between severity of CAD pre-TAVI and outcomes. In conclusion, we did not find a consistent relation between severity of CAD and revascularization with post-TAVI outcomes.

Surgical treatment of mild to moderately dilated ascending aorta in bicuspid aortic valve aortopathy: the art of safety and simplicity.  ;BACKGROUND: Evaluate the safety and efficacy of our modified technique of the extravascular procedure for treating mild to moderately dilated ascending aorta in patients with bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) aortopathy. METHODS: From January 2015 to December 2018,119 consecutive patients with BAV and ascending aorta dilatation (dimension 40 mm~ 45 mm) were diagnosed in our institution. Among these,49 patients received aggressive aortic valve replace (AVR) + ascending aorta wrapped (wrapped group) while the other 70 patients received AVR + ascending aorta replacement (wheat group). All patients clinical and follow up data were collected for 12 months. RESULTS: Aortic clamping and cardio-pulmonary bypass times were significantly longer in wheat group than wrap group (P < 0.001and 0.021,respectively). The first 24 h drainage in wheat group were much more than wrap group(P = 0.04). Ascending aorta diameter、left ventricular end diameter and ejection fraction were statistically different between pre- and post-operation (p < 0.001) in both groups, but the heart function and complication were no difference during follow up. CONCLUSIONS: External wrapping of the ascending aorta and wheat procedure have good short-term and long-term results in BAV patients with a mild to moderately dilated ascending aorta. The perioperative period results of external wrapping of the ascending aorta for BAV patients were encouraging.  
Reversal of stage 5 chronic kidney disease by aortic valve replacement in kidney transplant recipient: a case report.  ;BACKGROUND: Cardiorenal syndrome (CRS) is a group of pathophysiological disorders affecting heart and kidneys. CASE PRESENTATION: We present 44-year-old kidney transplant recipient with acute-on-chronic graft failure in the course of CRS due to acutely decompensated heart failure associated with severe aortic regurgitation successfully treated with aortic valve replacement. Because of graft failure progression and difficult to eradicate infections he was treated with dialysis and radical minimization of immunosuppression. After 74 days of renal replacement therapy the patient regained graft function after successful aortic valve replacement. The dialysis could be stopped and immunosuppressive therapy was reintroduced. Heart and renal function are stable and patient is doing well without dialysis for 3 years. CONCLUSIONS: The return of kidney graft function can occur even after a long period of dialysis therapy due to improved cardiovascular function. Therefore, distinguishing an acute-on-chronic CRS subtype is mandatory to enable specific patient approach.  
The economic impact of clinically significant tricuspid regurgitation in a large, administrative claims database.  ;"Aim: This study aimed to quantify the healthcare burden of clinically significant tricuspid regurgitation (TR) in patients with and without heart failure (HF).Materials and Methods: Data were from the IBM MarketScan Research Databases from October 2011 to September 2016. Eligible patients met the following inclusion criteria: age ≥18 with a TR diagnosis, 12 months pre (baseline), and 6 months post (landmark) medical enrollment. The landmark period was used to categorize TR severity, defined as a record of pulmonary hypertension with ascites, lower extremity edema or hepatic insufficiency, or tricuspid valve surgery. Cohorts were defined based on TR etiology and severity: (1) no HF and no clinically significant TR; (2) HF with no clinically significant TR; (3) no HF with clinically significant TR; and (4) HF with clinically significant TR. Outcomes of interest were all-cause hospitalizations, hospital days, and expenditures. Multivariable models were fit for each of the annualized outcomes and adjusted for patient demographics, comorbidities, and other concomitant valve diseases.Results: There were 92,994 patients eligible for analysis. Patients with no HF and no clinically significant TR had the annualized healthcare burden of 0.20 all-cause hospitalizations (approximately one inpatient hospitalization every 5 years), 1.07 hospital days, and $17,478 in expenditures. The presence of clinically significant TR, alone or with HF, significantly increased healthcare utilization and expenditures. For patients with no HF with clinically significant TR, the annualized economic burden increased to 0.41 all-cause hospitalizations, 3.13 hospital days, and $29,985 in expenditures. For patients with HF and clinically significant TR, the annualized economic burden was even greater with 0.59 all-cause hospitalizations, 4.31 hospital days, and $42,255 in expenditures.Conclusion: The presence of clinically significant TR is associated with an increase in healthcare utilization and expenditures, irrespective of the presence of HF.

Papillary muscle intervention vs mitral ring annuloplasty in ischemic mitral regurgitation.  ;"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The main pathophysiological factor of chronic ischemic mitral regurgitation (MR) is the outward displacement of the papillary muscles (PMs) leading to leaflet tethering. For this reason, papillary muscle intervention (PMI) in combination with mitral ring annuloplasty (MRA) has recently been introduced into clinical practice to correct this displacement, and to reduce the recurrence of regurgitation. METHODS: A meta-analysis was conducted comparing the outcomes of PMI and MRA performed in combination vs MRA performed alone, in terms of MR recurrence and left ventricular reverse remodeling (LVRR). A meta-regression was carried out to investigate the impact of the type of PMI procedure on the outcomes. RESULTS: MR recurrence in patients undergoing both PMI and MRA was lower than in those who only had MRA (log incidence rate ratio, -0.66; lower-upper limits, -1.13 to 0.20; I2  = 0.0%; p = .44; Egger's test: intercept 0.35 [-0.78 to 1.51]; p = .42). The group with both PMI and MRA and that with only MRA showed a slightly higher reduction in left ventricular diameters (-5.94%; -8.75% to 3.13%,). However, in both groups, LVRR was <10%. No difference was detected between PM relocation/repositioning and papillary muscle approximation in terms of LVRR (p = .33). CONCLUSIONS: Using PMI and MRA together has a lower MR recurrence than using MRA alone. No significant LVRR was observed between the two groups nor between the PMI techniques employed.  "
Transcatheter aortic valve implantation and cognitive function in elderly patients with severe aortic stenosis.  ;AIMS: The aim of this study was to examine the mechanisms of cognitive impairment and reversibility in elderly patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) with special reference to cerebral blood flow (CBF). METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined 15 elderly patients with severe AS (mean age 83.2±4.5 years, 12 female) who underwent TAVI. Before and three months after TAVI, we evaluated cognitive function with the Logical Memory II test (LM II), cardiac output (CO) with echocardiography, and CBF with 99mTc single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). LM II score and CO were significantly increased after TAVI compared with baseline (p<0.01 for LM II, p<0.005 for CO). Notably, CBF in the local regions, including that in the right hippocampus, was significantly increased after TAVI (p<0.005 at each voxel). The patients with increased CO after TAVI also showed significantly increased CBF in the right hippocampus compared with those without it (p<0.01). Importantly, CBF in the right hippocampus was positively correlated with LM II scores (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These results provide the first evidence that TAVI may improve cognitive functions associated with increased cerebral perfusion especially in the hippocampus in elderly patients with severe AS.  
Antioxidative enzyme activity and total antioxidant capacity in serum of dogs with degenerative mitral valve disease.  ;This study was designed to evaluate the antioxidative status of serum by measuring its total antioxidant capacity, as well as the antioxidant enzyme activity (superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione reductase), in dogs with various stages of degenerative mitral valve disease (DMVD) compared to healthy controls. In total, 71 client-owned dogs in different stages of DMVD, which included healthy controls, took part in the study. Following an anamnesis, clinical examination, standard transthoracic echocardiograpic examination, chest X-ray, complete blood (cell) count, and serum biochemistry, dogs were divided into 2 study groups. Blood was drawn from each dog once at the time of presentation and selected antioxidant parameters were measured using commercially available assay kits. The activity of superoxide dismutase gradually decreased in the more advanced stages of DMVD, while the activity of catalase was significantly higher in the group of dogs with asymptomatic DMVD compared to healthy controls and dogs with symptomatic DMVD. No significant changes were noted in total antioxidant capacity and the activity of glutathione reductase. Results suggested that DMVD has a significant impact on the activity of superoxide dismutase and catalase in the serum of the tested dogs. Knowledge of changes in the activity of antioxidative enzymes may warrant further studies, possibly to evaluate the potential role of compounds with antioxidative properties in the clinical outcome of dogs with DMVD.

Rupture of mitral valve papillary muscle: a rare complication following myocardial infarction.  ;Here we present a rare clinical presentation of papillary muscle rupture in a 55-year-old man who presented to accident and emergency department with chest pain and was diagnosed as having had a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction. During the admission, he developed papillary muscle rupture due to the myocardial infarction resulting in acute mitral regurgitation. This caused significant haemodynamic compromise needing emergency admission to the intensive care unit and eventually surgery to replace the valve.  
Comparison of Holter With Zio Patch Electrocardiography Monitoring in Children.  ;The standard for ambulatory arrhythmia detection in children is the Holter monitor. The Zio XT (Zio) patch has been FDA-approved for use in adults. However, its utility in children has not been directly compared with the Holter. We studied the ability to detect arrhythmias and patient comfort of the Zio versus the Holter in children. Patients <22 years old were prospectively enrolled to wear the Holter and Zio simultaneously for 48 hours at our institution. Detection of clinically significant arrhythmias was compared using McNemar's test. Wear-time and artifact time was compared using Wilcoxon sign test. Patient satisfaction ratings were analyzed with paired t tests. Two hundred patients (57% male) were included for analysis. The median age was 13.5 years (range 23 days to 21.7 years), and 40% had heart disease. The Zio and Holter had comparable median wear-times, 48.2 hours (interquartile range [IQR] 45.8 to 50.2]) versus 48.0 (48.0 to 48.0), respectively, p = 0.14, but the Zio had less artifact than the Holter, 2.8% (IQR 1.1 to 8.6) versus 5.6% (2.4 to 15.7), respectively, p <0.001. There was no difference in detection of clinically significant arrhythmias for the Zio versus the Holter (p = 0.23), however 75% of patients preferred the Zio over the Holter (p <0.001) due to lack of wires and the ability to shower. In conclusion, the Zio patch is as good as the Holter monitor in detection of clinically significant arrhythmias in children with less artifact. Patients/parents more often preferred the Zio over the Holter.  
Comparison of Long-Term Outcomes of Patients Having Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement With Versus Without Simultaneous Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting.  ;"Coronary artery disease is a common co-morbidity of aortic stenosis. When needed, adding coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) is the standard treatment method, but the impact of concomitant CABG on long-term outcomes is uncertain. We compared long-term outcomes of SAVR patients with and without CABG. Hospital survivors aged ≥50 years discharged after SAVR ± CABG in Finland between 2004 and 2014 (n = 6,870) were retrospectively studied using nationwide registries. Propensity score matching (1:1) was used to identify patients with comparable baseline features (n = 2,188 patient pairs, mean age 73 years). The end points were postoperative 10-year major adverse cardiovascular outcome (MACE), all-cause mortality, stroke, major bleeding, and myocardial infarction. Median follow-up was 6 years. Cumulative MACE rate (39.5% vs 35.6%; hazard ratio [HR] 1.04; p = 0.677) and mortality (32.7% vs 31.0%; HR 1.03; p = 0.729) after SAVR were comparable with or without CABG. Myocardial infarction was more common in patients with CABG (13.4% vs 6.9%; HR 1.47; p = 0.0495). Occurrence of stroke (15.1% vs 13.5%; p = 0.998) and major bleeding (20.0% vs 21.9%; p = 0.569) were comparable. There was no difference in gastrointestinal (8.1% vs 10.3%; p = 0.978) or intracranial bleeds (6.0% vs 5.5%; p = 0.794). The use of internal mammary artery in CABG did not have an impact on the results. In conclusion, matched patients with and without concomitant CABG had comparable long-term MACE, mortality, stroke, and major bleeding rates after SAVR. In conclusion, our results indicate that need for concomitant CABG has limited impact on long-term outcomes after initially successful SAVR.  "
Valve Hemodynamics Following Transcatheter or Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement in Patients With Small Aortic Annulus.  ;This study aimed to compare the hemodynamic performance of transcatheter and surgical aortic valves in patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis and small aortic annulus (SAA) and to determine the valve hemodynamics according to transcatheter valve type. Consecutive surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) and transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) patients with SAA were case-matched (1:1) on the basis of sex, body surface area, aortic annulus diameter, and left ventricular ejection fraction. A total of 357 patients in each group constituted the final study population. A second match on the basis of aortic annulus diameter and valve/annulus calcium burden was performed within the TAVR group to compare the valve performance between balloon- (n = 52) and self-expanding (n = 52) transcatheter valve systems (BEV, SEV). The echocardiograms performed at hospital discharge were used for evaluating valve hemodynamics. The mean annulus diameter of the study population was 19.2 ± 0.3 mm. The TAVR group (vs SAVR) exhibited lower mean gradient (12 ± 7 mm Hg vs 15 ± 6 mm Hg, p <0.001), larger effective orifice area (1.46 ± 0.39 cm2 vs 1.25 ± 0.37 cm2, p <0.001) and a lower rate of severe prosthesis-patient mismatch (PPM) (14% vs 24%, p = 0.001). Moderate-severe AR was present in 2.5% of the TAVR recipients versus none patient in the SAVR group. There were no differences in valve hemodynamics between balloon-expanding transcatheter valve system and self-expanding transcatheter valve system, and similar rates of severe PPM were observed in both groups (p = 0.488). In conclusion, TAVR presented superior valve hemodynamics and lower incidence of severe PPM compared with SAVR in SAA patients. Similar valve performance results were observed between transcatheter valve types.

Enlarged coronary sinus thrombosis after repair of Ebstein's anomaly.  ;"A 58-year-old woman was referred to our hospital with progressively increasing breathlessness. She reported a history of bioprosthetic valve implantation for tricuspid valve replacement and direct closure of an atrial septal defect for Ebstein's anomaly, 31 years before presentation. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed prosthetic valve failure, an enlarged coronary sinus, and severe mitral regurgitation. Computed tomography revealed a giant coronary sinus with thrombosis and persistent left superior vena cava. She underwent successful mitral and tricuspid valve replacement; however, severe hemodynamic deterioration necessitated mechanical ventilatory support with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.  "
Unravelling the Pathogenetic Mechanisms in Congenital Aortopathies: Need for an Integrative Translational Approach.  ;Congenital heart disease (CHD)-associated aortopathy is a very heterogeneous entity with a wide spectrum of clinical presentations. The pathogenesis of aortopathy is still incompletely understood, and, therefore, the best prevention and management strategy is currently unknown. The most common entity of CHD-associated aortopathies is bicuspid aortic valve (BAV)-associated aortic disease (so called bicuspid aortopathy) that is found in 50%-60% of BAV individuals. BAV aortopathy has been reported in association with an increased risk of aortic events, especially aortic dissection and sudden cardiac death. Risk stratification of adverse aortic events is still very rudimentary and considers only the maximal aortic diameter, which makes it unsuitable for an individual risk prediction. This introductory Editorial highlights the unmet clinical need for more integrative and translational research to unravel pathogenetic pathways in the development of CHD-associated aortopathies, integrating recently identified genetic lesions and knowledge on circulating biomarkers and microstructural changes in the diseased aorta.  
Computed Tomography Angiography Combined With Knowledge-Based Iterative Algorithm for Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation Planning: Image Quality and Radiation Dose Exposure With Low-kV and Low-Contrast-Medium Protocol.  ;"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate image quality and radiation dose exposure of low-kV setting and low-volume contrast medium (CM) computed tomography angiography (CTA) protocol for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) planning in comparison with standard CTA protocol. METHODS: Sixty-patients were examined with 256-row MDCT for TAVI planning: 32 patients (study group) were evaluated using 80-kV electrocardiogram-gated protocol with 60 mL of CM and IMR reconstruction; 28 patients underwent a standard electrocardiogram-gated CTA study (100 kV; 80 mL of CM; iDose4 reconstruction). Subjective and objective image quality was evaluated in each patient at different aortic levels. Finally, we collected radiation dose exposure data (CT dose index and dose-length product) of both groups. RESULTS: In study protocol, significant higher mean attenuation values were achieved in all measurements compared with the standard protocol. There were no significant differences in the subjective image quality evaluation in both groups. Mean dose-length product of study group was 56% lower than in the control one (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Low-kV and low-CM volume CTA, combined with IMR, allows to correctly performing TAVI planning with high-quality images and significant radiation dose reduction compared with standard CTA protocol.

MRI Evaluation of an Atrial-Anchored Transcatheter Mitral Valve Replacement Implant.  ;OBJECTIVE. A medical implant that is made from metal must undergo proper MRI testing to ensure patient safety. The purpose of this investigation was to assess issues with MRI with a newly developed atrial-anchored transcatheter mitral valve replacement (TMVR) implant. MATERIALS AND METHODS. The atrial-anchored TMVR implant underwent an in vitro evaluation for MRI safety issues using standardized techniques and well-accepted methods. Magnetic field interactions including translational attraction and torque and artifacts were tested at 3 T. MRI-related heating was assessed at 1.5 T/64 MHz and 3 T/128 MHz using numeric simulations with analytical modeling and experimental testing. RESULTS. The atrial-anchored TMVR implant exhibited minor magnetic field interactions (9° deflection angle and no torque) at 3 T. The findings from the numeric simulations with analytical modeling were used to guide the placement of the implant in the phantom for the heating test and to identify the position on the implant that would result in the highest temperature rise. The highest temperature elevations recorded for the TMVR implant obtained on MRI at 1.5 T/64 MHz and 3 T/128 MHz were 2.7°C and 2.4°C, respectively. The maximum artifact size seen on a gradient echo pulse sequence extended approximately 5 mm relative to the size of the implant. CONCLUSION. The results of the tests performed on the atrial-anchored TMVR implant revealed no substantial concerns with respect to the conditions used in this investigation. Therefore, a patient with this new implant can safely undergo MRI by following the specific conditions defined by this study. The implant was deemed MR Conditional.

Perpendicular and turbulent flow after aortic valve replacement: paravalvular or transvalvular leakage? - a case report.  ;BACKGROUND: Perpendicular transvalvular leakage (TVL) is occasionally observed after aortic valve replacement (AVR) in biological valves with a stent post, often originating from the base of the stent post. However, an observed perpendicular jet flow is not always a TVL. In rare cases, paravalvular leakages (PVLs) can be perpendicular and are present behind a TVL. In the present case, both PVL and TVL existed simultaneously as unusual perpendicular jet flows that originated from sites in close proximity to the stent post. CASE PRESENTATION: A 73-year-old man underwent AVR with a biological valve in the supra-annular position using the non-everting mattress suture technique with pledgets. After weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) revealed an unfamiliar perpendicular turbulent flow, similar to reported TVL, originating from the anterior stent post. Further TEE examination revealed a PVL had originated from the site between the sewing ring at the anterior stent post and native annulus attached to a pledget. The space between the sewing ring and annular retained native portion caused the perpendicular turbulent jet. Consequently, two types of perpendicular turbulent flows, TVL and PVL, existed adjacent to each other. After reinstitution of CPB, inspection of the prosthesis itself indicated it to be normal, but there was a region adjacent to the anterior stent post near the right coronary ostium where the tip of the curved Pean forceps entered between the sewing ring and the native annulus. The region was consistent with TEE findings. AVR was performed with the same prosthesis again. After weaning from CPB, immediate TEE revealed that the unusual perpendicular turbulent flows had disappeared and only a few small TVLs were observed. Regarding the disappearance of TVL, we considered that the fabric region of the prosthetic valve was covered with cellular elements to prevent the leak, as it was already used in AVR once and soaked in blood. CONCLUSIONS: Perpendicular turbulent flow raises the possibility of both TVL and PVL in the case of AVR with stented bovine pericardial valves. For a differential diagnosis of TVL or PVL, it is important to know the surgical procedures and valve morphology.  
Incidence, Temporal Trends, and Associated Outcomes of Vascular and Bleeding Complications in Patients Undergoing Transfemoral Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: Insights From the Society of Thoracic Surgeons/American College of Cardiology Transcatheter Valve Therapies Registry.  ;"BACKGROUND: Vascular and bleeding complications were commonly reported in transcatheter aortic valve replacement clinical trials. Little is known about complication rates in contemporary US clinical practice or clinical outcomes associated with these complications. METHODS: In the Society of Thoracic Surgeons/American College of Cardiology Transcatheter Valve Therapy Registry, we evaluated patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement from November 1, 2011 to June 30, 2016. The primary outcomes were in-hospital vascular complications and bleeding events. Secondary outcomes included all-cause mortality, stroke, and rehospitalization at 1 year. P values for trends were calculated for rates over time, and multivariable logistic regression was used to determine the association between vascular/bleeding complications and in-hospital clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Overall, 34 893 patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement at 445 hospitals were analyzed. Of these, 9.3% (n=3257) experienced a vascular complication while 7.6% (n=2651) had an in-hospital bleeding event. Rates of both vascular complications and bleeding events decreased over time (P value for trend test <0.0001); however, there was significant variation in rates across hospital sites (adjusted median rate, 11.4%; IQR, 8.9-14.5). Vascular complications were independently associated with 30-day death (adjusted HR, 2.23 [95% CI, 1.80-2.77]) and death (adjusted HR, 1.17 [95% CI, 1.05-1.30]) and rehospitalization (adjusted HR, 1.14 [95% CI, 1.07-1.22]) at 1 year. Bleeding events were also associated with 30-day death (adjusted HR, 3.71 [95% CI, 2.94-4.69]), and with death (adjusted HR, 1.39 [95% CI, 1.23-1.56]) and hospital readmission (adjusted HR, 1.19 [95% CI, 1.11-1.27]) at 1 year. CONCLUSIONS: In patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement in the US, vascular complications and in-hospital bleeding events were common, but rates have declined over time with significant variation in complication rates across hospital sites. Vascular and bleeding complications are both associated with worse short- and long-term clinical outcomes including all-cause mortality. Further innovation to reduce sheath sizes and optimize antithrombotic therapy is necessary to reduce the incidence of these detrimental complications.  "
Impact of Valvulo-Arterial Impedance on Long-Term Quality of Life and Exercise Performance After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.  ;"BACKGROUND: In aortic stenosis, valvulo-arterial impedance (Zva) estimates the overall left ventricular afterload (valve and arterial component). We investigated the association of Zva (≥5 versus <5 mm Hg mL-1 m-2) on quality of life (QOL) and exercise performance (EP) ≥1 year after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). METHODS: The study population consists of 250 TAVR patients in whom baseline Zva and follow-up QOL was prospectively assessed using EuroQOL-5-dimensions instruments; EP was assessed in 192 patients who survived ≥1 year after TAVR using questionnaires related to daily activities. In 124 patients, Zva at 1-year was also available and was used to study the change in Zva (baseline to 1 year) on QOL/EP. RESULTS: Elevated baseline Zva was present in 125 patients (50%). At a median of 28 (IQR, 17-40) months, patients with elevated baseline Zva were more limited in mobility (88% versus 71%; P=0.004), self-care (40% versus 25%; P=0.019), and independent daily activities (taking a shower: 53% versus 38%, P=0.030; walking 100 meter: 76% versus 54%, P=0.001; and walking stairs: 74% versus 54%, P=0.011). By multivariable analysis, elevated Zva predicted unfavorable QOL (lower EuroQOL-5-dimensions-Utility Index, odds ratio, 1.98; CI, 1.15-3.41) and unfavorable EP (any limitation in ≥3 daily activities, odds ratio, 2.55; CI, 1.41-4.62). After TAVR, the proportion of patients with elevated Zva fell from 50% to 21% and remained 21% at 1 year and was found to be associated with more limitations in mobility, self-care, and daily activities compared with patients with Zva <5 mm Hg mL-1 m-2. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated Zva was seen in half of patients and predicted unfavorable long-term QOL and EP. At 1 year after TAVR, the prevalence of elevated Zva was 21% but remained associated with poor QOL/EP.  "
Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging for assessment of mitral stenosis before and after percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty in comparison to two- and three-dimensional echocardiography.  ;BACKGROUND: The experience with cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) in mitral stenosis (MS) is limited in contrast to mitral regurgitation. PURPOSE: To compare CMR versus 2D and 3D transthoracic (TTE) and 3D transesophgeal (TEE) echocardiography in assessment of rheumatic MS before and after percutaneous balloon mitral valvuloplasty (PBMV). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty consecutive symptomatic patients with MS were evaluated prospectively and independently by CMR, TTE, and TEE pre-PBMV, and by CMR and TTE post-PBMV. Mitral valve area (MVA) was assessed by CMR planimetry, TTE and TEE planimetry, and pressure half time (PHT). Further assessment included trans-mitral velocity, mitral regurgitation (MR), and left atrial (LA) volume. RESULTS: PBMV was successful in 18 patients and failed in two patients (one with MVA <1.5 cm2, one developed severe MR). Pre-PBMV and MVA by CMR, 2D TTE, biplane, 3D TTE, 3D TEE, and PHT were 1.16, 1.16, 1.10, 1.02, 1.05, and 0.99 cm2, respectively. Post-PBMV, a significant increase in MVA was observed (2.15, 2.06, 2.07, 2.04, and 2.03 cm2, respectively). High agreement was observed between CMR and echocardiography before and after PBMV, except for PHT method. CMR significantly underestimated trans-mitral velocity and gradients compared to echocardiography (P<0.001). Before PBMV, mild MR was observed in 11, 12, and 19 patients by 2D TTE, 3D TTE, and CMR. After PBMV, MR was observed in all patients (19 mild, one severe) by all modalities. Echocardiography significantly underestimated LA volume compared to CMR (P<0.001). LA volume decreased significantly after PBMV (P<0.001). CONCLUSION: CMR provides comprehensive assessment of several parameters in MS patients before and after intervention. Agreement with echocardiography is acceptable.  
Effect of temperature variation on hospital admissions and outcomes in dogs with myxomatous mitral valve disease and new onset pulmonary edema.  ;The effect of seasonal variation on hospital admissions and outcomes in humans with cardiovascular disease and congestive heart failure (CHF) has been described. This study evaluates the effect of temperature variation on admissions and outcomes in dogs with myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) and first onset CHF. Ninety-three client-owned dogs with MMVD and a first occurrence of pulmonary edema were included in this retrospective clinical cohort study. Recorded clinical and echocardiographic variables were accumulated and analyzed with dogs allocated into groups in a temperature-wise manner that considered the mean of the average (Tave) and maximum ambient temperature (Tmax) of the 14 days preceding hospital admission. A survival analysis was also performed. No difference was found in the percentage of dogs decompensating in three different temperature periods (i.e., cold, intermediate, and hot temperature) according to both Tave and Tmax. Dogs developing CHF during the intermediate temperatures according to Tmax died earlier from cardiac-related causes (median survival time 280 days, 95% CI = 147-486 days) compared to those decompensating during hot temperatures (median survival time 518 days, 95% CI = 344-819 days, P = 0.039). However, an effect of the ambient temperature on survival was not confirmed by Cox proportional hazard analysis. In conclusion, this study failed to show that ambient temperature has an effect on the first occurrence of CHF and outcomes in dogs with MMVD.  
A smartphone-enabled wireless and batteryless implantable blood flow sensor for remote monitoring of prosthetic heart valve function.  ;Aortic valve disease is one of the leading forms of complications in the cardiovascular system. The failing native aortic valve is routinely surgically replaced with a bioprosthesis. However, insufficient durability of bioprosthetic heart valves often requires reintervention. Valve degradation can be assessed by an analysis of the blood flow characteristics downstream of the valve. This is cost and labor intensive using clinical methodologies and is performed infrequently. The integration of consumer smartphones and implantable blood flow sensors into the data acquisition chain facilitates remote management of patients that is not limited by access to clinical facilities. This article describes the characteristics of an implantable magnetic blood flow sensor which was optimized for small size and low power consumption to allow for batteryless operation. The data is wirelessly transmitted to the patient's smartphone for in-depth processing. Tests using three different experimental setups confirmed that wireless and batteryless blood flow recording using a magnetic flow meter technique is feasible and that the sensor system is capable of monitoring the characteristic flow downstream of the valve.

Left ventricular mechanical dispersion in flow-gradient patterns of severe aortic stenosis with narrow QRS complex.  ;"Patients with severe aortic stenosis are classified according to flow-gradient patterns. We investigated whether left ventricular (LV) mechanical dispersion, a marker of dyssynchrony and predictor of mortality, is associated with low-flow status in aortic stenosis. 316 consecutive patients with aortic stenosis and QRS duration < 120 ms were included in the retrospective analysis. Patients with severe aortic stenosis (aortic valve area ≤ 1.0 cm2) were classified as normal-flow (NF; stroke volume index > 35 ml/m2) high-gradient (HG; mean transvalvular gradient ≥ 40 mmHg) (n = 79), NF low-gradient (LG) (n = 62), low-flow (LF) LG ejection fraction (EF) ≥ 50% (n = 57), and LF LG EF < 50% (n = 23). Patients with moderate aortic stenosis (aortic valve area 1.5-1.0 cm2; n = 95) served as comparison group. Mechanical dispersion (calculated as standard deviation of time from Q/S onset on electrocardiogram to peak longitudinal strain in 17 left ventricular segments) was similar in patients with NF HG (49.4 ± 14.7 ms), NF LG (43.5 ± 12.9 ms), LF LG EF ≥ 50% (47.2 ± 16.3 ms) and moderate aortic stenosis (44.2 ± 15.7 ms). In patients with LF LG EF < 50%, mechanical dispersion was increased (60.8 ± 20.7 ms, p < 0.05 vs. NF HG, NF LG, LF LG EF ≥ 50% and moderate AS). Mechanical dispersion correlated with global longitudinal strain (r = 0.1354, p = 0.0160) and heart rate (r = 0.1587, p = 0.0047), but not with parameters of aortic stenosis. Mechanical dispersion was similar among flow-gradient subgroups of severe aortic stenosis with preserved LVEF, but increased in patients with low-flow low-gradient and reduced LVEF. These findings indicate that mechanical dispersion is rather a marker of systolic myocardial dysfunction than of aortic stenosis.  "

Contemporary Outcomes of Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement in Japan.  ;"BACKGROUND: Given the rapid expansion in the use of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), recent outcomes of surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) should be re-evaluated.Methods and Results:Using the data from the Japan Cardiovascular Surgery Database of 160 enrolled hospitals, trends in elective isolated SAVR were evaluated until the introduction of TAVI in Japan. Trend analyses were performed over 4 periods: period 1, 2008-2009 (4,415 cases); period 2, 2010-2011 (4,861 cases); period 3, 2012-2013 (5,674 cases); and period 4, 2014-2015 (5,563 cases). Baseline risk, evaluated on JapanSCORE, increased significantly over the 4 periods, from a median of 1.56 (IQR, 0.99-2.61) in period 1 to 2.08 (IQR, 1.33-3.96) in period 4 (P<0.001, trend test). Despite the increased risk, the composite major complication and operative mortality rate decreased significantly (10.7% in period 1 to 9.2% in period 4, P=0.01). Using a risk-adjusted model, the OR of operative mortality was 1.61 (95% CI: 1.29-2.02) in period 1 (P<0.0001) compared with period 4. An increase in the use of bioprostheses was also observed, from 60.4% to 76.8% (P<0.001) over the 4 periods. CONCLUSIONS: Even in a short 8-year period, SAVR outcomes improved in Japan. This should be taken into account when discussing the indications for aortic valve intervention.  "
Effects of the Sounds of Different Mechanical Mitral Valves on Quality of Life at Different Follow-Up Times: A Single-Center Study.  ;OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of the sounds of different types of mechanical mitral valves on the quality of life (QoL) of patients at different follow-up times. METHODS: We collected data from 150 patients who underwent mechanical mitral valve replacement. Three time points were assessed, including at discharge, the third postoperative month (POM3), and the twelfth postoperative month (POM12). The SF-36 and a self-questionnaire were used to assess the QoL. RESULTS: Regarding the SF-36 scores, the ATS valve was superior to the Sorin and SJM valves in terms of some items. Moreover, the scores at discharge of all three mechanical valve groups were lower than those at POM3 and POM12. For the self-questionnaire scores, with the increase in postoperative time, the number of patients affected by the mechanical valve sounds decreased gradually. Considering the relevant influencing factors, older women were more likely to be affected by the valve sounds than were younger individuals and men. CONCLUSION: The overall postoperative QoL improved for patients who underwent mechanical mitral valve replacement. In the comparative study, the impact of the ATS valve was better than those of the Sorin and SJM valves, but this difference gradually disappeared over time.

Tracking Cardiac Rehabilitation Participation and Completion Among Medicare Beneficiaries to Inform the Efforts of a National Initiative.  ;"BACKGROUND: Despite cardiac rehabilitation (CR) being shown to improve health outcomes among patients with heart disease, its use has been suboptimal. In response, the Million Hearts Cardiac Rehabilitation Collaborative developed a road map to improve CR use, including increasing participation rates to ≥70% by 2022. This observational study provides current estimates to measure progress and identifies the populations and regions most at risk for CR service underutilization. METHODS AND RESULTS: We identified Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries who were CR eligible in 2016, and assessed CR participation (≥1 CR session attended), timely initiation (participation within 21 days of event), and completion (≥36 sessions attended) through 2017. Measures were assessed overall, by beneficiary characteristics and geography, and by primary CR-qualifying event type (acute myocardial infarction hospitalization; coronary artery bypass surgery; heart valve repair/replacement; percutaneous coronary intervention; or heart/heart-lung transplant). Among 366 103 CR-eligible beneficiaries, 89 327 (24.4%) participated in CR, of whom 24.3% initiated within 21 days and 26.9% completed CR. Eligibility was highest in the East South Central Census Division (14.8 per 1000). Participation decreased with increasing age, was lower among women (18.9%) compared with men (28.6%; adjusted prevalence ratio: 0.91 [95% CI, 0.90-0.93]) was lower among Hispanics (13.2%) and non-Hispanic blacks (13.6%) compared with non-Hispanic whites (25.8%; adjusted prevalence ratio: 0.63 [0.61-0.66] and 0.70 [0.67-0.72], respectively), and varied by hospital referral region and Census Division (range: 18.6% [East South Central] to 39.1% [West North Central]) and by qualifying event type (range: 7.1% [acute myocardial infarction without procedure] to 55.3% [coronary artery bypass surgery only]). Timely initiation varied by geography and qualifying event type; completion varied by geography. CONCLUSIONS: Only 1 in 4 CR-eligible Medicare beneficiaries participated in CR and marked disparities were observed. Reinforcement of current effective strategies and development of new strategies will be critical to address the noted disparities and achieve the 70% participation goal.  "
Ventriculoatrial Shunt Catheter Tip Migration Causing Tricuspid Regurgitation: Case Report and Review of the Literature.  ;BACKGROUND: Given recent positive safety evidence, ventriculoatrial (VA) shunt placement may increase in popularity once more. We describe a rare case of Tricuspid regurgitation due to VA shunt catheter tip traversing the valve. CASE DESCRIPTION: A woman aged 42 years with a preexisting VA shunt was referred to this center with 3 months of orthostatic headache, nausea, and palpitations that occurred while sleeping on her right side. An echocardiogram demonstrates a VA shunt catheter in the right atrium during cardiac diastole, which traversed the tricuspid annular plane during cardiac systole. The echocardiogram revealed mild to moderate tricuspid regurgitation. She had no clinical evidence of cardiac failure or arrhythmia and had normal electrocardiogram findings. The catheter tip appeared to be adhered to the underside of the leaflets or to the chordae tendineae. Pulling the catheter tip back could therefore cause irreversible damage to the tricuspid valve. For this reason, the catheter was not removed, and the patient was referred for close follow-up with cardiologists. A literature review was performed to determine where this rare complication fits into the spectrum of VA shunt distal catheter complications, and what techniques can be done to avoid similar occurrences. CONCLUSIONS: This report reiterates the importance of ensuring the tip is carefully placed within the atrium, under fluoroscopic guidance. Although rare, the described complication is difficult to manage once it has occurred.  
Morphological and functional characteristics of mitral annular calcification and their relationship to stroke.  ;"BACKGROUND: Mitral annular calcification (MAC) is associated with risk of stroke. This study aimed to define the morphological and functional characteristics of MAC that are related to stroke. METHODS: A total of 460 subjects with MAC from transthoracic echocardiography in a single center from 2012 to 2016 was retrospectively reviewed. Subjects were classified into two groups according to history of stroke [Group 1 (n = 366): without stroke; Group 2 (n = 94): with stroke]. Morphological and functional features of MAC on echocardiogram were scored from 0 to 3 according to MAC mobility, presence of echodense mass with central echolucencies in the periannular region suggesting caseous necrosis, and functional stenosis. RESULTS: Significantly more patients in group 2 were men and had history of diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, atrial fibrillation, or infective endocarditis. Although MAC thickness and extent did not differ between the two groups, group 2 showed a considerably higher MAC score than group 1 (0.50 ± 0.77 vs. 0.23 ±0.52 p<0.001) as a result of the higher prevalence of each component in group 2 [mobility (22 vs. 11%, p = 0.003), echodense mass with central areas of echolucencies suggesting caseous necrosis (23 vs. 7%, p<0.001), and functional mitral stenosis (12 vs. 7%, p = 0.042)]. On logistic regression analysis, MAC score was independently associated with stroke and showed significant incremental value to demographic factors and comorbidities in association with stroke in a consecutive manner. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, morphological and functional characteristics of MAC had incremental value in association with stroke over traditional risk factors. MAC score consisting of MAC mobility, typical echodense mass with central echolucencies suggesting caseous necrosis, and functional mitral stenosis was independently associated with stroke. MAC with high-risk features may act as a source of stroke or more potent composite surrogate markers for stroke-related risk factors.  "
Trends of the prevalence and incidence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in Korea: A nationwide population-based cohort study.  ;Temporal trends of the prevalence and incidence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) have not been well established in Asian populations. Using the Korean National Health Insurance Services database, we identified patients with a confirmed diagnosis of HCM between 2010 and 2016. The annual prevalence and incidence of HCM, and their clinical characteristics were investigated. The prevalence of HCM has increased from 0.016% (n = 6313) in 2010 to 0.031% (n = 13,035) in 2016. During a 7-year period, 13,229 patients were newly diagnosed with HCM. The incidence rate increased from 4.15 (per 100,000 person-years) in 2010 to 5.6 in 2016. The prevalence and incidence of HCM increased with age and peaked during the 70s, with male predominance in all age groups. Chest pain is the most frequent clinical presentation followed by shortness of breath and syncope. Hypertension and dyslipidemia were the two most common comorbidities. Heart failure and atrial fibrillation was diagnosed in about 1/3 and 1/4 of patients with HCM, respectively. The prevalence and incidence of HCM gradually increased from 2010 to 2016, possibly due to heightened recognition of the disease. Given the progressively high incidence of HCM with age and high prevalence of coexisting modifiable risk factors, continued efforts are required to increase awareness regarding HCM-related symptoms and potential complications.  
Anterior Tricuspid Leaflet Cleft in an Adult Male: An Autopsy Case Report.  ;"The deceased was a 44-year-old male who was treated for a suspected Ebstein's anomaly observed using transthoracic echocardiogram. He was found dead in his bed at home. Autopsy revealed that the septal tricuspid leaflet was intact; however, a large anterior tricuspid leaflet cleft and right atrioventricular cavity dilation were observed. Pathological examination revealed a normal tricuspid valve, except for the presence of a cleft with local fibrosis of the left ventricle papillary muscle and hemosiderin-containing macrophages at both lungs. There were no other abnormalities that may have led to death. It was concluded that he died a cardiac death based on the right heart overload associated with the anterior tricuspid leaflet cleft. This case indicates the possibility that the anterior tricuspid leaflet cleft can cause death and also highlights the necessity of a detailed autopsy to accurately diagnose the cause of death.  "
Does minimal invasive cardiac surgery reduce the incidence of post-operative atrial fibrillation?  ;"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common post-operative complication and tends to be the most common arrhythmia after cardiac surgery. The etiology and risk factors for post-operative AF are poorly understood, but older age, large left atrium, diffuse coronary artery disease, a history of AF paroxysms and in general, pre-existing cardiac conditions that cause restricting and susceptibility towards inflammation have been consistently linked with post-operative atrial fibrillation (POAF). It has been traditionally thought that post-operative AF is transient, well-tolerated, benign to the patient and self-limiting complication of cardiac surgery that was temporary and easily treated. However, recent evidence suggests that POAF may be more ""malignant"" than previously thought, associated with follow-up mortality and morbidity. Several minimally invasive approaches, including the right parasternal approach, upper and lower mini-sternotomy (MS), V-shaped, Z-shaped, inverse-T, J-, reverse-C and reverse-L partial MS, transverse sternotomy and right mini-thoracotomy, have been developed for cardiac surgery operations since 1993 and have been associated with better outcomes and lower perioperative morbidity compared to full sternotomy (FS). The common goal of several minimally invasive approaches is to reduce invasiveness and surgical trauma. According to a statement from the American Heart Association (AHA), the term ""minimally invasive"" refers to a small chest wall incision that does not include a FS. This review is aimed to evaluate the use of minimally invasive techniques like mini-sternotomy, mini-thoracotomy and hybrid techniques versus conventional techniques which are used in cardiac surgery and to compare the frequency of post-operative AF and its effect on post-operative complications, morbidity and mortality, after cardiac surgery operations with FS versus cardiac surgery operations with the use of minimally invasive techniques.

Treatment of Severe TRIcuspid Regurgitation in Patients with Advanced Heart Failure with CAval Vein Implantation of the Edwards Sapien XT VALve (TRICAVAL): a randomised controlled trial.  ;AIMS: The aim of our study was to compare the impact of implantation of a balloon-expandable transcatheter valve into the inferior vena cava (CAVI) on exercise capacity with optimal medical therapy (OMT) in patients with severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR) and high surgical risk. METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients were randomised to OMT (n=14) or CAVI (n=14). The primary endpoint was maximal oxygen uptake at the three-month follow-up. Secondary endpoints included six-minute walk test, NYHA class, NT-proBNP levels, right heart function, unscheduled heart failure hospitalisation, and quality of life as assessed by the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLHFQ). Patients underwent follow-up examinations one, three, six, and twelve months after randomisation. Maximal oxygen uptake did not change significantly in either group after three months and there was no difference between the OMT and CAVI groups (-0.1±1.8 ml∙kg-1∙min-1 vs -1.0±1.6 ml∙kg-1∙min-1, p=0.4995). Compared to baseline, CAVI improved NYHA class, dyspnoea, and quality of life after three months. However, there were no statistically significant differences in the secondary endpoints between the groups. Four periprocedural complications occurred after CAVI, resulting in open heart surgery. Four patients in the OMT group and eight patients (including four after conversion to surgery) in the CAVI group died from right heart failure, sepsis or haemorrhage. CONCLUSIONS: CAVI did not result in a superior functional outcome compared to OMT. Due to an unexpectedly high rate of valve dislocations, the study was stopped for safety reasons.  
Prognostic Influence of Feature Tracking Multidetector Row Computed Tomography-Derived Left Ventricular Global Longitudinal Strain in Patients with Aortic Stenosis Treated With Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.  ;"Computed tomography plays a central role in the evaluation of patients with severe aortic stenosis who underwent transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). Advances in left ventricular (LV) analysis with multidetector row computed tomography (MDCT) permit measurement of LV global longitudinal strain (GLS). The present study aimed at evaluating the association between feature tracking (FT) MDCT derived LV GLS and all-cause mortality in patients treated with TAVI. A total of 214 patients with severe aortic stenosis (51% male, 80 ± 7 years) who underwent TAVI and with dynamic MDCT data allowing LV GLS measurement with novel FT algorithm were included. LV GLS was measured at baseline and were divided according to a previously published cut-off value of LV GLS associated with all-cause mortality (≤-14% [more preserved LV systolic function] vs >-14% [more impaired LV systolic function]). Patients were followed for the occurrence of all-cause mortality. Mean FT MDCT-derived LV GLS was -12.5 ± 4%. During a median follow-up of 45 months (interquartile range: 29 to 62 months), 67 (31%) patients died. The cumulative rate of all-cause mortality for the patients with FT MDCT-derived LV GLS ≤-14% was 15% versus28% for the patients with FT MDCT-derived LV GLS >-14%, Log rank p = 0.001). FT MDCT-derived LV GLS was independently associated with all-cause mortality (hazard ratio: 0.851; 95% confidence interval: 0.772 to 0.937; p = 0.001). In conclusion, impaired FT MDCT-derived LV GLS is independently associated with all-cause mortality in patients treated with TAVI. Besides aortic valve area and calcification, FT MDCT-derived LV GLS is an important prognostic marker.  "
Deficiency of Circulating Monocytes Ameliorates the Progression of Myxomatous Valve Degeneration in Marfan Syndrome.  ;"BACKGROUND: Myxomatous valve degeneration (MVD) involves the progressive thickening and degeneration of the heart valves, leading to valve prolapse, regurgitant blood flow, and impaired cardiac function. Leukocytes composed primarily of macrophages have recently been detected in myxomatous valves, but the timing of the presence and the contributions of these cells in MVD progression are not known. METHODS: We examined MVD progression, macrophages, and the valve microenvironment in the context of Marfan syndrome (MFS) using mitral valves from MFS mice (Fbn1C1039G/+), gene-edited MFS pigs (FBN1Glu433AsnfsX98/+), and patients with MFS. Additional histological and transcriptomic evaluation was performed by using nonsyndromic human and canine myxomatous valves, respectively. Macrophage ontogeny was determined using MFS mice transplanted with mTomato+ bone marrow or MFS mice harboring RFP (red fluorescent protein)-tagged C-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2) monocytes. Mice deficient in recruited macrophages (Fbn1C1039G/+;Ccr2RFP/RFP) were generated to determine the requirements of recruited macrophages to MVD progression. RESULTS: MFS mice recapitulated histopathological features of myxomatous valve disease by 2 months of age, including mitral valve thickening, increased leaflet cellularity, and extracellular matrix abnormalities characterized by proteoglycan accumulation and collagen fragmentation. Diseased mitral valves of MFS mice concurrently exhibited a marked increase of infiltrating (MHCII+, CCR2+) and resident macrophages (CD206+, CCR2-), along with increased chemokine activity and inflammatory extracellular matrix modification. Likewise, mitral valve specimens obtained from gene-edited MFS pigs and human patients with MFS exhibited increased monocytes and macrophages (CD14+, CD64+, CD68+, CD163+) detected by immunofluorescence. In addition, comparative transcriptomic evaluation of both genetic (MFS mice) and acquired forms of MVD (humans and dogs) unveiled a shared upregulated inflammatory response in diseased valves. Remarkably, the deficiency of monocytes was protective against MVD progression, resulting in a significant reduction of MHCII macrophages, minimal leaflet thickening, and preserved mitral valve integrity. CONCLUSIONS: All together, our results suggest sterile inflammation as a novel paradigm to disease progression, and we identify, for the first time, monocytes as a viable candidate for targeted therapy in MVD.

Relationships between visceral/subcutaneous adipose tissue FABP4 expression and coronary atherosclerosis in patients with metabolic syndrome.  ;"BACKGROUND: Cytoplasmic fatty acid-binding proteins facilitate the transport of lipids to specific compartments in cells. Fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4), also known as aP2 or A-FABP, plays a key role in the development of atherosclerosis, insulin resistance, obesity, and metabolic syndrome (MS). The FABP4 polymorphisms are associated with protein expression changes in vitro and metabolic and vascular alterations in vivo. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between FABP4 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression levels in epicardial (EAT), pericardial (PAT), and subcutaneous adipose tissues (SAT), and the extent of coronary atherosclerosis in coronary artery disease (CAD) patients with MS. Furthermore, the relationship between the extent of coronary atherosclerosis and epicardial adipose tissue volume (EATV) and FABP4 gene variations was evaluated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 37 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting because of CAD (MS CAD group) and 23 non-MS patients undergoing heart valve surgery (control group) were included. Coronary angiography was performed for all patients and the extent of coronary atherosclerosis was assessed using the Sullivan's scoring system. The mRNA expression levels of FABP4 gene in EAT, PAT, and SAT, and FABP4 polymorphisms were analyzed using the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). RESULTS: An increased FABP4 expression was observed in EAT and PAT of MS CAD group compared to controls. In the MS CAD group, FABP4 mRNA expression levels in EAT was 2.8-fold higher compared to PAT. The expression of FABP4 in EAT was positively correlated with the extent of atherosclerosis and EATV in MS CAD group (r = 0.588, P= 0.001, r = 0.174, P = 0.001, respectively). There were no correlations between PAT and SAT versus the extent of atherosclerosis and EATV. The FABP4 EAT mRNA expression levels were found to significantly increase in mutant allele carriers of rs1054135, whereas they significantly decreased in mutant allele carriers of rs77878271 (T-87C) in MS CAD group (P < 0.05). The extent of atherosclerosis was also found to be significantly associated with rs1054135 (P < 0.05). A cut-off point of 57.5 cm3 EATV was used indicating the presence of CAD with a significant area under the curve of 0.783%, 98% sensitivity, and 100% specificity (95% CI 0.620-0.880; P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our study results suggest that FABP4 expression in EAT is strongly associated with the extent of atherosclerosis and EATV in MS CAD patients.  "

Daytime Variation in Aortic Valve Surgery and Clinical Outcome: A Propensity Score-Matched Analysis.  ;"BACKGROUND: Time of day potentially impacts outcomes in cardiac surgery. Therefore, the goal of this study was to assess whether elective aortic valve replacement surgery performed in the morning versus the afternoon is associated with differences in risk-adjusted morbidity and mortality. METHODS: We performed a propensity score-matched analysis on 2720 consecutive patients (1360 pairs) who underwent elective aortic valve replacement with or without coronary artery bypass grafting at our institution between July 2009 and December 2016. The primary endpoint was a composite of death, myocardial infarction, or heart failure up to a maximum follow-up of 500 days. Secondary endpoints were perioperative troponin concentrations and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: The primary endpoint did not differ between the morning surgery group (8.5%; n = 113) and the afternoon surgery group (8.4%, n = 111), with a hazard ratio for the morning surgery group (reference: afternoon surgery group) of 1.01 (95% confidence interval, 0.78-1.32; P = .93). Event risks of the components of the primary endpoint were also similar between the study groups (all P > .05). The postoperative troponin decline was slightly more pronounced in the morning surgery group than in the afternoon surgery group (P < .001), whereas in-hospital mortality was similar between study groups (P > .99). CONCLUSIONS: In our propensity score-matched analysis on 2720 patients undergoing elective isolated aortic valve replacement or combined aortic valve replacement and coronary artery bypass grafting, time of day variation had no significant impact on clinical outcomes. Thus our study refutes the need to consider the timing of elective aortic valve surgery to improve clinical outcomes.  "
Coagulation: At the heart of infective endocarditis.  ;Infective endocarditis is a life-threatening and enigmatic disease with a mortality of 30% and a pathophysiology that is poorly understood. However, at its core, an endocarditis lesion is mainly a fibrin and platelet blood clot infested with bacteria, clinging at the cardiac valves. Infective endocarditis therefore serves as a paradigm of immunothrombosis gone wrong. Immunothrombosis refers to the entanglement of the coagulation system with innate immunity and the role of coagulation in the isolation and clearance of invading pathogens. However, in the case of infective endocarditis, instead of containing the infection, immunothrombosis inadvertently creates the optimal shelter from the immune system and allows some bacteria to grow almost unimpeded. In every step of the disease, the coagulation system is heavily involved. It mediates the initial adhesion of bacteria to the leaflets, fuels the growth and maturation of a vegetation, and facilitates complications such as embolization and valve destruction. In addition, the number one cause of infective endocarditis, Staphylococcus aureus, has proven to be a true manipulator of immunothrombosis and thrives in the fibrin rich environment of an endocarditis vegetation. Considering its central role in infective endocarditis, the coagulation system is an attractive therapeutic target for this deadly disease. There is, however, a very delicate balance at play and the use of antithrombotic drugs in patients with endocarditis is often accompanied with a high bleeding risk.  
Acute Kidney Recovery in Patients Who Underwent Transcatheter Versus Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement (from the Northern New England Cardiovascular Disease Study Group).  ;"Acute kidney recovery (AKR) is a recently described phenomenon observed after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and is more frequent than acute kidney injury (AKI). To determine the incidence and predictors of AKR between surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) and TAVR, we examined patients with chronic kidney disease and severe aortic stenosis who underwent SAVR or TAVR procedure between 2007 and 2017; excluding age <65 or >90, dialysis, endocarditis, non-aortic valve stenosis, or patients died within 48-hours postprocedure. AKR was defined as an increase of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) >25% and AKI as decrease in eGFR >25% at discharge. Stroke, mortality, major bleeding, transfusion, and length of stay were examined. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to examine predictors of AKR. There were 750 transcatheter and 1,062 surgical patients and 319 pairs after propensity matching. AKR was observed in 26% TAVR versus 23.2% SAVR, p = 0.062. Highest recovery was in patients with eGFR <30 for both TAVR (33.7%) and SAVR (34.5%) patients. Independent predictors of AKR were ejection fraction <50% (odds ratio [OR] 1.66, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02 to 2.71, p = 0.042), female gender (OR 1.66, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.5, p = 0.015), and obesity (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.04-2.3, p = 0.032). Diabetes was a negative predictor of AKR (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.84, p = 0.005). AKR was associated with improved secondary clinical outcomes compared with AKI. In conclusion, AKR is a generalizable phenomenon occurring frequently and similarly among transcatheter or surgical aortic valve patients. Diabetes is a negative predictor of AKR, possibly indicative of less reversible kidney disease.  "
Comparative quantification of primary mitral regurgitation by computer modeling and simulated echocardiography.  ;Clinical investigations have demonstrated that mitral regurgitation (MR) quantification using echocardiography (echo) may significantly underestimate or overestimate the regurgitant volume, especially for two-dimensional (2D) echo. Computer modeling and simulated echo were conducted to evaluate the fundamental assumptions in the echo quantification of primary MR that is due to posterior mitral leaflet prolapse. The theoretical flaw of the proximal isovelocity surface area (PISA) method originates from the assumption that the MR flow rate is the product of the isovelocity surface area and aliasing velocity, which is only valid when the velocity vectors are perpendicular to the isovelocity surface. Other factors such as the Doppler angle effect, the view planes of 2D echo, and the single time instant of PISA were also analyzed. We find that the hemielliptic PISA method gives the smallest error for moderate and severe MR cases compared with other PISA methods. Compared with the PISA method, the volumetric technique (VT) is theoretically more robust. By considering correction factors that are caused by nonflat velocity profiles and the closing volume of the aortic valve, the accuracy of the VT method can be significantly improved. The corrected volumetric technique provides more accurate results compared with the PISA methods, especially for mild MR.NEW & NOTEWORTHY We evaluate the accuracy of common echocardiography techniques for the quantification of primary mitral regurgitations using computer modeling. The hemielliptic proximal isovelocity surface area (PISA) method gives the smallest error (within 15%) for moderate and severe mitral regurgitation cases compared with other PISA methods. The volumetric method is theoretically more robust than the PISA method. The accuracy of the volumetric method can be improved by a correction factor around 0.7 because of the nonflat velocity profiles and the closing volume of the aortic valve.  
[Ebstein's anomaly : from fetal diagnosis to surgical treatment].  ;Ebstein's anomaly is a rare and complex congenital heart disease involving abnormal embryological development of the tricuspid valve. Its exact prevalence remains unknown given the under-diagnosis of minor forms and the broad clinical spectrum of this pathology resulting from the highly variable tricuspid morphology. Echocardiography plays an important role in diagnosis, assessment and prognostic evaluation of this condition. We present the case of a 6-year-old boy born from a twin pregnancy with a severe neonatal EA diagnosed by ultrasound at 29 weeks of gestation and we discuss the management on the light of the recent literature.  
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: the future of treatment.  ;Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a heterogeneous genetic disorder most often caused by sarcomeric mutations resulting in left ventricular hypertrophy, fibrosis, hypercontractility, and reduced compliance. It is the most common inherited monogenic cardiac condition, affecting 0.2% of the population. Whereas currently available therapies for HCM have been effective in reducing morbidity, there remain important unmet needs in the treatment of both the obstructive and non-obstructive phenotypes. Novel pharmacotherapies directly target the molecular underpinnings of HCM, while innovative procedural techniques may soon offer minimally-invasive alternatives to current septal reduction therapy. With the advent of embryonic gene editing, there now exists the potential to correct underlying genetic mutations that may result in disease. This article details the recent developments in the treatment of HCM including pharmacotherapy, septal reduction procedures, mitral valve manipulation, and gene-based therapies.

Expert Consensus Systems of Care Proposal to Optimize Care for Patients With Valvular Heart Disease Review of the 2019 Document for the Cardiac Anesthesiologist.  ;Valvular heart disease requiring intervention is increasing in prevalence in the adult population. With advancement in transcatheter and surgical procedures for valvular heart disease, optimization of patient selection, availability of resources and personnel, appropriate training and certification, and optimal periprocedural management rely on clinical evaluation, accurate echocardiographic interpretation, and understanding of valvular pathophysiology by the cardiac anesthesiologist. To optimize care and improve access for patients with valvular heart disease the Expert Consensus Systems of Care Document by Nishimura et al.1 was recently published. The authors propose a protocol with guidelines and performance metrics to create tiered-level valve centers. This review focuses and expands on aspects discussed in Nishimura et al.'s Expert Consensus Systems of Care Document that are relevant to the cardiac anesthesiologist in the periprocedural setting.  
Discrepancy between musical ability and language skills in children with Williams syndrome.  ;BACKGROUND: Children with Williams syndrome (WS) show a marked interest in music, a characteristic often explored in clinical settings. However, the actual musical abilities of patients with WS remain debatable due to some of the relevant data being derived from experimental tasks that require a verbal response, despite the known language impairments in WS. The present study aimed to examine musical ability in children with WS using a newly invented pitch discrimination task with minimal involvement of language and clarify its relationship with language skill. METHODS: Eleven children with WS participated in the study. We used a novel pitch discrimination task that required minimal language use. Two piano tones were presented sequentially, and children were asked to give a non-verbal response as to whether the second tone was higher than, lower than, or the same as the first tone. RESULTS: Pitch discrimination performance in children with WS was lower than the level predicted for their chronological age (CA), even in the non-verbal task. Pitch discrimination ability and verbal mental age (VMA) were shown to be dissociated, such that children with WS with a lower skill level for language showed an unexpectedly higher level of pitch discrimination ability and vice versa. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicated reduced musical ability with respect to CA in children with WS. The dissociation between musical ability and language skills may indicate unique developmental relationships that differ from those in normal children. These findings provide new evidence to support the importance of assessing actual musical ability in WS prior to implementing interventional music therapy.  
Impact of aortic valve calcification severity on device success after transcatheter aortic valve replacement.  ;Aortic valvular calcium score (AVCS) can identify severe aortic stenosis (AS) and provide powerful prognostic information. In severe and symptomatic AS, patients can be referred for a transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). The aim of this study was to determine whether AVCS, measured on the preoperative contrast enhanced multislice computed tomography (MSCT), is associated with device success (DS), major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) and paravalvular leak (PVL) after TAVR. Three hundred and fifty-two consecutive patients who underwent TAVR with a preoperative standardised contrast enhanced MSCT were included in the study. Valvular calcification detection was defined by adding + 100 Hounsfield Unit (HU) to mean HU determined by a region of interest placed in the contrast enhanced ascending aorta. AVCS was then indexed to the aortic annulus surface (AVCSi). Endpoints were DS and 30-day MACE according to Valve Academic Research Consortium-2 consensus document, and moderate to severe PVL. DS was obtained for 305 patients. In multivariate analysis, AVCSi was negatively and independently associated with DS: OR = 0.99, 95% CI 0.99-0.99, p = 0.03. In the subgroup analysis, this association was particularly relevant with self-expanding prostheses [n = 151 (43%), p = 0.018] and in the cases of asymmetric calcium valvular distribution [n = 283 (80%), p 0.002]. There was no association between MACE and AVCS (p = 0.953) and AVCSi (p = 0.757). PVL was positively associated with AVCS (p < 0.001) and AVCSi (p < 0.001). In conclusion, in TAVR, AVCS, measured on preoperative contrast enhanced MSCT, is significantly associated with DS and PVL, but not with 30-day MACE. Its routine use could be relevant to appreciate success chances of TAVR.  
A 15 Year's Experience with Minimally Invasive Mitral Valve Replacement in Bangladesh.  ;"This study was aimed to compare the long-term outcomes and survival rate among mitral valve replacement using thoracotomy and standard median sternotomy in a single surgeon's practice. Total 250 patients were evaluated; Group I (n=65) patients had anterolateral thoracotomy and Group II (n=185) had standard median sternotomy for valve replacement. Mean age was 25.1±5 years in Group I and 41.8±10.5 years in Group II. Female was predominant in Group I. Total operative time and bypass time was statistically significant in Group I (235.5±25.8 minutes; 84.2±12.75 minutes) in contrast to Group II (203.8±15.5 minutes; 71.5±10.5 minutes). Incision scar was not visible in females in Group I but full incision scar was visible in Group II. Post-operative ICU stay duration was significant high in Group II. Though, wound infection incidence was 0% in Group I; however, 9.73% patient had wound infection in Group II. Only 1.62% patient developed unstable sternum in Group II. Most of the patients from both study group were in regular follow up and 1-year mortality rate was 4.62% and 5.94% in Group I and Group II respectively. Mitral valve replacement through a right anterolateral thoracotomy is easy and safe to perform; while getting maximum benefits for the patients. Besides satisfactory cosmetic outcome especially in female, this approach provides better exposure to mitral apparatus even in patients with small left atrium, cost effectiveness, less duration of hospital stays and absence of the risk for unstable sternum.

Giant unruptured sinus of Valsalva aneurysm successfully managed with valve-sparing procedure - a case report.  ;BACKGROUND: Sinus of Valsalva aneurysm (SVA) is an uncommon cardiac anomaly, with an incidence of less than 1% of open heart surgery cases. Its evolution is most frequently silent, being found incidentally or discovered in the event of its acute rupture. Non-ruptured giant SVAs may cause unusual clinical manifestations, as a consequence of their protrusion into the heart chambers or compression of the coronary vessels and are frequently associated with aortic insufficiency of various degrees of severity. The gold standard treatment for SVAs consists of complete replacement of the aortic root and valve. However, in certain cases, valve-sparing procedures may prove to be a more suitable alternative. CASE PRESENTATION: A 68-year-old male patient presented with dyspnea as symptom caused by a large (> 5 cm) right sinus of Valsalva aneurysm. The aneurysm was occupying most of the right ventricle and was associated with severe aortic regurgitation. The surgical treatment of the condition involved valve-sparing root reconstruction procedure (remodeling technique), completed with external stabilization of the aortic valve annulus via running suture annuloplasty. Following the uneventful intervention, the patient did well and his status improved. The follow-up transthoracic echocardiography obtained 1 month after surgery showed a fully competent aortic valve with no regurgitation. CONCLUSIONS: Despite complete aortic root and valve replacement being considered the safest approach to large SVAs complicated with aortic insufficiency, valve-sparing procedures should not be overlooked in case of a dilated aortic root with uncalcified aortic valve. Performing valve-sparing by applying a remodeling technique operation completed with annuloplasty reduces aortic valve insufficiency, avoiding side-effects related to implanted valves.

Gene-based anticoagulation regimens for an infant after mitral-valve replacement: A case report.  ;"RATIONALE: Heart-valve replacement is one of the main surgical methods for various heart-valve diseases. Warfarin is the only oral anticoagulant used for thrombosis prevention after heart-valve replacement. However, warfarin has a narrow therapeutic window, large differences in efficacy between individuals, and can be affected by drugs, food and disease status. PATIENT CONCERNS: We used the Hamberg model to develop an anticoagulation regimen for a 10-month-old Chinese male after mitral-valve replacement. DIAGNOSES: Echocardiography revealed mitral malformation with severe regurgitation, patent foramen ovale, thickening of the left ventricular wall, enlargement of the left atrium, and the overall systolic function of the left ventricle was lower than normal. INTERVENTIONS: First, the patient was treated with Mitral valvuloplasty plus temporary implantation of a pacing wire. Since this was inadequate, he underwent mitral-valve replacement. Then, we used the Hamberg model to develop an anticoagulation regimen. OUTCOMES: After discharge from hospital, the pharmacist provided anticoagulation management for this pediatric patient using an ""Online Anticoagulation Clinic"" (OAC). Point-of-care testing could be employed by the boy's mother at home to obtain the International Normalized Ratio. His time to response was 89.6% during the 6 months after hospital discharge, and adverse reactions such as bleeding or thrombosis did not occur. LESSONS: This is the first time the Hamberg model has been employed to design anticoagulation therapy for an Asian infant. His anticoagulation therapy may be managed using the OAC.  "
Hybrid trans-apical atrioventricular valve-in-valve implantation in Fontan circulation.  ;Trans-apical approach has been proved successful in failing surgical bio-prosthesis in both mitral and aortic position in adult patients. Recently, valve-in-valve treatments have been applied even in patients with complex congenital heart disease. Here, we report the case of a 32 years old lady with left atrial isomerism, complete AV septal defect, interrupted inferior vena cava with azygos continuation who underwent Kawashima procedure with atrial Fontan. Severe systemic atrioventricular valve regurgitation necessitated a 33 mm Perimount valve implantation and conversion to lateral tunnel Fontan. After only 4 years there was severe valve stenosis and the patient underwent successful trans-apical transcatheter implantation of a 29 mm Sapien valve.

Effect of Aortic Wall Deformation with Healthy and Calcified Annulus on Hemodynamic Performance of Implanted On-X Valve.  ;INTRODUCTION: In this research, the hemodynamic performance of a 23-mm On-X bileaflet mechanical heart valve (BMHV) was investigated with the realistic geometry model of the valve and the deformable aorta in accelerating systole. In addition, the effect of ascending aorta flexibility and aortic annulus calcification on the complex blood flow characteristics were investigated. METHODS: The geometry of the aorta is derived from the medical images, and the Ogden model has been utilized for the mechanical behavior of the ascending aorta. The 3D numerical simulation by a two-way Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) analysis using the Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) method was performed throughout the accelerating systolic phase. RESULTS: The dynamics of the leaflets are investigated, and blood flow characteristics such as velocities, vorticities as well as viscous and turbulent shear stress were precisely captured in the flow domain specifically in the hinge region. Streamline results are in accordance with the previously reported data, which show that the flared On-X valves inlet yields a more uniform flow in accelerating systole. Simulations show that aorta flexibility or valve annulus calcification causes variations up to 7% in maximum fluid velocity and 20% in Turbulence Kinetic Energy (TKE). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the complex flow field characteristics in the new generation of BMHVs considering aorta flexibility with healthy and calcified annulus were investigated. It was found that the blood flow around the hinges region is in the danger of hemolysis and platelet activation and subsequently thromboembolism. Furthermore, the results show that similar to vessel wall deformation, considering the probable annulus calcification after valve replacement is also essential.  
Calcific Aortic Valve Stenosis and Atherosclerotic Calcification.  ;PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review summarizes the pathophysiology of calcific aortic valve stenosis (CAVS) and surveys relevant clinical data and basic research that explain how CAVS arises. RECENT FINDINGS: Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)], lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2), oxidized phospholipids (OxPL), autotaxin, and genetic driving forces such as mutations in LPA gene and NOTCH gene seem to play a major role in the development of CAVS. These factors might well become targets of medical therapy in the coming years. CVAS seems to be a multifactorial disease that has much in common with coronary artery disease, mainly regarding lipidic accumulation and calcium deposition. No clinical trials conducted to date have managed to answer the key question of whether Lp(a) lowering and anti-calcific therapies confer a benefit in terms of reducing incidence or progression of CAVS, although additional outcome trials are ongoing.  
Feasibility and accuracy of real-time three-dimensional echocardiography in evaluating the aortic valve in children.  ;"BACKGROUND: Aortic valve assessment by 2D transthoracic echocardiography is a relatively complex task owing to the unique anatomical features of the left ventricular outflow tract and its dynamic nature. We aimed to evaluate the accuracy of 3D transthoracic echocardiography [3D TTE] in assessing the aortic valve in children. RESULTS: The first group included 11 males and six females, with a mean age of 5.76 ± 6.39 years. All of these patients had aortic valve disease with a bicuspid variant. The second group included seven males and seven females, with a mean age of 4.4 ± 4.05 years. All of these patients had normal aortic valve morphology and had another congenital cardiac anomaly. The aortic valve annulus was assessed using the three modalities; 2D, 3D echocardiography in the vertical and horizontal diameters, and angiography. The aortic valve area was measured by 2D and 3D echocardiography using multiplane reformatted mode. The results of the analysis were then compared. They revealed that 3D echocardiographic measurement of the aortic annulus (horizontal diameter) correlated better with angiography than 2D and 3D (vertical diameter) echocardiographic measurements. There was a significant difference between the aortic valve area measured by 2D echocardiography and that measured by 3D echocardiography among the two groups, 2D echocardiography seems to underestimate the true aortic valve area. CONCLUSION: The study concluded that 3D TTE with multiplane reformatted mode allows a more accurate assessment of the aortic valve when compared to 2D echocardiography and this correlates better with the angiographic findings.

Association of plasma-soluble ST2 and galectin-3 with cardiovascular events and mortality following cardiac surgery.  ;"BACKGROUND: Cardiac surgery induces hemodynamic stress on the myocardium, and this process can be associated with significant post-operative morbidity and mortality. Soluble suppression of tumorigenicity 2 (sST2) and galectin-3 (gal-3) are biomarkers of myocardial remodeling and fibrosis; however, their potential association with post-operative changes is unknown. METHODS: We measured peri-operative plasma sST2 and gal-3 levels in two prospective cohorts (TRIBE-AKI and NNE) of over 1800 patients who underwent cardiac surgery. sST2 and gal-3 levels were evaluated for association with a composite primary outcome of cardiovascular event or mortality over median follow-up periods of 3.4 and 6.0 years, respectively, for the two cohorts. Meta-analysis of hazard ratio estimates from the cohorts was performed using random effects models. RESULTS: Cohorts demonstrated event rates of 70.2 and 66.8 per 1000 person-years for the primary composite outcome. After adjustment for clinical covariates, higher post-operative sST2 and gal-3 levels were significantly associated with cardiovascular event or mortality [pooled estimate HRs: sST2 1.29 (95% CI 1.16, 1.44); gal-3 1.26 (95% CI 1.09, 1.46)]. These associations were not significantly modified by pre-operative congestive heart failure or AKI. CONCLUSIONS: Higher post-operative sST2 and gal-3 values were associated with increased incidence of cardiovascular event or mortality. These two biomarkers should be further studied for potential clinical utility for patients undergoing cardiac surgery.  "
Echocardiographic examination of mitral valve abnormalities in the paediatric population: current practices.  ;"We reviewed the recent literature for echocardiographic assessment of mitral valve abnormalities in children. A literature search was performed within the National Library of Medicine using the keywords ""mitral regurgitation and/or stenosis, children."" The search was refined by adding the keywords ""echocardiographic definition, classification, and evaluation."" Thirty-one studies were finally included. Significant advances in echocardiographic imaging of mitral valve defects, mainly due to the implementation of three-dimensional technology, contribute to a better understanding of the underlying anatomy. However, heterogeneity between classification systems of mitral valve disease severity is a serious problem. For regurgitant lesions, there is only very limited evidence from small studies that support the adoption of quantitative/semi-quantitative indexes commonly employed in adults. Despite the lack of evidence base, qualitative evaluation of regurgitation severity is often employed. For stenotic lesions, no clear categorisation based on trans-valvular echocardiography-derived ""gradients"" has been consistently applied to define mild, moderate, or severe obstruction across different paediatric age ranges. Quantitative parameters such as valve area have also been poorly validated in children. Adult recommendations are frequently applied without validation for the paediatric age. In conclusion, significant advances in the anatomical evaluation of mitral valve diseases have been made, thanks to three-dimensional echocardiography; however, limitations remain in the quantitative/semi-quantitative estimation of disease severity, both with respect to valvular regurgitation and stenosis. Because adult echocardiographic recommendations should not be simply translated to the paediatric age, more specific paediatric guidelines and standards for the assessment of mitral valve diseases are needed.

Comparison of quality of life in patients who underwent mechanical mitral valve replacement: star GK vs SJM.  ;BACKGROUND: We want to compare the impact on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) between the Star GK and the SJM valve in the Chinese population. METHODS: We retrospectively enrolled a total of 172 patients who had undergone mechanical mitral valve replacement (MVR) (SJM valve in 87 patients and Star GK valve in 85 patients) at our institution from January 2013 to December 2015. We measured the sound pressure level, and used 2 self-administered questionnaires and the Chinese version of SF-36 to measure the HRQoL and valve-specific questions to evaluate patient anxiety. RESULTS: The Star GK group and the SJM group were similar in age, gender, body surface area, diameter of the implanted valve, underlying disease and current median NYHA class. Regarding the valve sound pressure perceived 1 year after operation, the SJM valve was slightly quieter than the Star GK valve, but the sound pressures of the two valves showed no significant differences. No significant differences in any of the eight subscales of the SF-36 were found between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that the Star GK valve is similar to the SJM valve in its impact on HRQoL and audibility of mechanical sound in the Chinese population.  
Psychometric properties of the Danish Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale in patients with cardiac disease: results from the DenHeart survey.  ;"BACKGROUND: Anxiety and depression symptoms are common among cardiac patients. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) is frequently used to measure symptoms of anxiety and depression; however, no study on the validity and reliability of the scale in Danish cardiac patients has been done. The aim, therefore, was to evaluate the psychometric properties of HADS in a large sample of Danish patients with the four most common cardiac diagnoses: ischemic heart disease, arrhythmias, heart failure and heart valve disease. METHODS: The DenHeart study was designed as a national cross-sectional survey including the HADS, SF-12 and HeartQoL and combined with data from national registers. Psychometric evaluation included analyses of floor and ceiling effects, structural validity using both exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis and hypotheses testing of convergent and divergent validity by relating the HADS scores to the SF-12 and HeartQoL. Internal consistency reliability was evaluated by Cronbach's alpha, and differential item functioning by gender was examined using ordinal logistic regression. RESULTS: A total of 12,806 patients (response rate 51%) answered the HADS. Exploratory factor analysis supported the original two-factor structure of the HADS, while confirmatory factor analysis supported a three-factor structure consisting of the original depression subscale and two anxiety subscales as suggested in a previous study. There were floor effects on all items and ceiling effect on item 8. The hypotheses regarding convergent validity were confirmed but those regarding divergent validity for HADS-D were not. Internal consistency was good with a Cronbach's alpha of 0.87 for HADS-A and 0.82 for HADS-D. There were no indications of noticeable differential item functioning by gender for any items. CONCLUSIONS: The present study supported the evidence of convergent validity and high internal consistency for both HADS outcomes in a large sample of Danish patients with cardiac disease. There are, however, conflicting results regarding the factor structure of the scale consistent with previous research. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01926145.  "
Advances in transcatheter mitral and tricuspid therapies.  ;BACKGROUND: While rheumatic mitral stenosis has been effectively treated percutaneously for more than 20 years, mitral and tricuspid regurgitation treatment appear as a contemporary unmet need. The advent of transcatheter therapies offer new treatment options to often elderly and frail patients at high risk for open surgery. We aimed at providing an updated review of fast-growing domain of transcatheter mitral and tricuspid technology. MAIN BODY: We reviewed the existing literature on mitral and tricuspid transcatheter therapies. Mitraclip is becoming an established therapy for secondary mitral regurgitation in selected patients with disproportionately severe regurgitation associated with moderate left ventricle dysfunction. Evidence is less convincing for primary mitral regurgitation. Transcatheter mitral valve replacement is a promising emerging alternative to transcatheter repair, for secondary as well as primary mitral regurgitation. But further development is needed to improve delivery. Transcatheter tricuspid intervention arrives late after similar technologies have been developed for aortic and mitral valves and is currently at its infancy. This is likely due in part to previously under-recognized impact of tricuspid regurgitation on patient outcomes. Edge-to-edge repair is the most advanced transcatheter solution in development. Data on tricuspid annuloplasty and replacement is limited, and more research is warranted. CONCLUSION: The future appears bright for transcatheter mitral therapies, albeit their place in clinical practice is yet to be clearly defined. Tricuspid transcatheter therapies might address the unmet need of tricuspid regurgitation treatment.

Increased systolic vorticity in the left ventricular outflow tract is associated with abnormal aortic flow formations in Tetralogy of Fallot.  ;Aortopathy is a recognized comorbidity of Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF). Aortic flow in children with repaired TOF is abnormal despite normal aortic valve anatomy and early surgical repair that results in aortic size normalization. The purpose of this study was to investigate the flow hemodynamics inside the left ventricle (LV) of children with repaired TOF using 4D-Flow MRI derived vorticity. Vorticity is the spatial derivative of flow velocity and is sensitive to anatomic and geometric variations. Vorticity was calculated inside the LV of children with repaired TOF having normal aortic size (n = 14) and normal controls (n = 10) during systolic ejection phase. All subjects underwent comprehensive biventricular analysis including the MRI based feature-tracking based LV strain analysis and mechanical dyssynchrony. Right ventricular (RV) volumetric indices along with LV mechanical indices were correlated with LV vorticity. All TOF patients had supraphysiologic helical flow in the ascending aorta. The generated peak systolic vorticity integrated over the LV volume was elevated in TOF group compared to control (median: 1344 vs. 858 s-1, P < 0.001). TOF patients had increased LV mechanical dyssynchrony (47 ± 11 vs. 32 ± 7 ms, P < 0.001) and reduced LV global circumferential strain (19 ± 2 vs. 21 ± 2%, P = 0.020). In the TOF group, LV systolic vorticity was independent of RV size and LV mechanical indices. Pathologic aortic flow in children with repaired TOF is associated with abnormal ejection flow patterns inside the LV. Increased systolic vorticity was not associated with LV mechanical dyssynchrony and RV dilation, suggesting that systolic flow inside the LV is independent of impaired LV contractile mechanics and inter-ventricular interactions.

Association of the European Society of Cardiology echocardiographic probability grading for pulmonary hypertension with short and mid-term clinical outcomes after heart valve surgery.  ;"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is associated with higher mortality and morbidity after valvular heart surgery, mainly through its adverse effect on right ventricular hemodynamic. Recently, the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) PH guidelines introduced a PH probability grading that lists additional parameters related to right ventricular dimensions. We evaluated the impact of such score on short- and mid-term outcomes in patients undergoing left heart valvular surgery. METHODS AND RESULTS: We included 60 consecutive patients (mean age 70 ± 9 years) undergoing left heart valvular surgery with or without coronary artery bypass. Patients were divided into 3 groups according to the PH probability: ""low"" (n = 18), ""intermediate"" (n = 18), or ""high"" (n = 24). The high PH probability group had higher rate of World Health Organization-Functional Class (WHO-FC) III and IV, hemodynamic complications, deaths, major bleeding events and infections after heart surgery than the other groups. A ""high"" PH probability was associated with reduced right ventricular systolic function, as measured by the fractional area change (FAC), but not with the tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE). CONCLUSION: The high PH probability as evaluated by the ESC PH echocardiographic probability model, is associated with increased short- and mid-term mortality and morbidity and reduced right ventricular systolic function after cardiac surgery, Thus, additional echocardiographic parameters assessing PH probability are valuable tools to stratify risk in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.

Importance of Preoperative Computed Tomography Assessment of the Membranous Septal Anatomy in Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement With a Balloon-Expandable Valve.  ;"BACKGROUND: Cardiac conduction disturbance (CD) is the most frequent complication following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). This study examined whether the anatomy of the membranous septum (MS) could provide useful information about the risk of CD following TAVR with a balloon-expandable valve (BEV).Methods and Results:Among 132 consecutive patients, 106 (mean age, 85.6±5.1 years; 75 females) were included in the study. Using preoperative CT and angiography, MS length and implantation depth (ID) were assessed. The MS length minus the prosthesis ID was calculated (∆MSID). Correlation between CD, defined as new-onset left-bundle branch block (LBBB) or the need for permanent pacemaker (PPM) within 1 week after the procedure, and MS length were evaluated. A total of 19 patients (18%) developed CD following TAVR. MS length was significantly shorter in these patients than in those without CD (5.3±1.3 vs. 6.6±1.4; P<0.001), and was the important predictor of CD (odds ratio [OR]: 0.43, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.27-0.69, P<0.001). When considering the pre- and postprocedural parameters, the ∆MSID was smaller in patients with CD (-1.7±1.5 vs. 0.8±1.9, P<0.001), and emerged as the important predictor of CD (OR: 0.47, 95% CI: 0.33-0.69, P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Short MS is associated with an increased risk of CD after TAVR with BEV.  "

Late management of the aortic root after repair of tetralogy of Fallot: A European multicentre study.  ;OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine the indications, type, and outcomes of reoperations on the aortic root after repair of tetralogy of Fallot (TOF). METHODS: Eleven centers belonging to the European Congenital Heart Surgeons Association contributed to the data collection process. We included 36 patients who underwent surgical procedures on the aortic root, including surgery on the aortic valve and ascending aorta, between January 1975 and December 2017. Original diagnoses included TOF-pulmonary stenosis (n = 18) and TOF-pulmonary atresia (n = 18). The main indications for reoperation were aortic insufficiency (n = 19, 53%), aortic insufficiency and dilatation of the ascending aorta (n = 10, 28%), aortic root dilatation (n = 4, 11%), and ascending aorta dilatation (n = 3, 8%). RESULTS: The median age at reoperation was 30.4 years (interquartile range 20.3-45.3 years), and mechanical aortic valve replacement was the most common procedure performed. Five patients died early after reoperation (14%), and larger ascending aorta diameters were associated with early mortality (P = .04). The median age at the last follow-up was 41.4 years (interquartile range 24.5-51.6 years). Late death occurred in five patients (5/31, 16%). Most survivors (15/26, 58%) were asymptomatic at the last clinical examination (New York Heart Association, NYHA class I). The remaining patients were NYHA class II (n = 7) and III (n = 3). The most common symptoms were fatigue (n = 5), dyspnea (n = 4), and exercise intolerance (n = 3). CONCLUSIONS: Reoperations on the aortic root are infrequent but may become necessary late after TOF repair. The main indications for reoperation are aortic insufficiency, either isolated or associated with a dilatation of the ascending aorta. The surgical risk at reoperation was high and the presence of ascending aorta dilation is related to higher mortality.

In vitro study of trileaflet polytetrafluoroethylene conduit and its valve-in-valve transformation.  ;OBJECTIVES: Handmade trileaflet expanded polytetrafluoroethylene valved conduit developed using the flip-over method has been tailored for pulmonary valve reconstruction with satisfactory outcomes. We investigated the in vitro performance of the valve design in a mock circulatory system with various conduit sizes. In our study, the design was transformed into a transcatheter stent graft system which could fit in original valved conduits in a valve-in-valve fashion. METHODS: Five different sizes of valved polytetrafluoroethylene vascular grafts (16, 18, 20, 22 and 24 mm) were mounted onto a mock circulatory system with a prism window for direct leaflets motion observation. Transvalvular pressure gradients were recorded using pressure transducers. Mean and instant flows were determined via a rotameter and a flowmeter. Similar flip-over trileaflet valve design was then carried out in 3 available stent graft sizes (23, 26 and 28.5 mm, Gore aortic extender), which were deployed inside the valved conduits. RESULTS: Peak pressure gradient across 5 different sized graft valves, in their appropriate flow setting (2.0, 2.5 and 5.0 l/min), ranged from 4.7 to 13.2 mmHg. No significant valve regurgitation was noted (regurgitant fraction: 1.6-4.9%) in all valve sizes and combinations. Three sizes of the trileaflet-valved stent grafts were implanted in the 4 sizes of valved conduits except for the 16-mm conduit. Peak pressure gradient increase after valved-stent graft-in-valved-conduit setting was <10 mmHg in all 4 conduits. CONCLUSIONS: The study showed excellent in vitro performance of trileaflet polytetrafluoroethylene valved conduits. Its valved stent graft transformation provided data which may serve as a reference for transcatheter valve-in-valve research in the future.  
Relevance of New Conduction Disorders After Implantation of the ACURATE Neo Transcatheter Heart Valve in the Aortic Valve Position.  ;The ACURATE neo transcatheter heart valve has been associated with very low rates of new conduction disorders (CDs). We assessed the clinical relevance of new CDs in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) with this valve. Data of consecutive patients without a pre-existing left bundle branch block (LBBB) or a permanent pacemaker (PPM) undergoing TAVR with the ACURATE neo were analyzed from the prospective SwissTAVI registry. Patients with new CDs were compared with patients with an unchanged electrocardiogram (ECG). ACURATE neo was implanted in 203 patients (mean age 82 ± 6 years, 63% women), CDs occurred in 28 patients (22 [11%] developed a LBBB, 6 [3%] required a PPM). New CDs resulted in a longer median duration of hospitalization (7 vs 5 days, interquartile range 4 to 13 vs 3 to 8 days, p = 0.04). At 1-year follow-up, left ventricular ejection fraction was significantly lower in patients with new CDs comparedwith patients with an unchanged ECG (54% ± 13% vs 61% ± 9%, p <0.01). Kaplan-Meier estimates of survival at 1-year were 89% in patients with new CDs and 95% in patients with an unchanged ECG (hazard ratio 2.0, 95% confidence interval 0.7 to 6.2, p = 0.22). After TAVR with the self-expanding ACURATE neo valve, the rate of new CDs, including complete LBBB was low and very few patients required a new PPM. However, new CDs prolonged initial hospitalization and increased the risk for left ventricular-dysfunction at 1-year follow-up. Patients without new CDs had excellent outcomes with a very high survival rate at 1-year follow-up.  
Quantification of left atrial function in patients with non-obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy by cardiovascular magnetic resonance feature tracking imaging: a feasibility and reproducibility study.  ;"BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and is associated with adverse outcomes in HCM patients. Although the left atrial (LA) diameter has consistently been identified as a strong predictor of AF in HCM patients, the relationship between LA dysfunction and AF still remains unclear. The aim of this study is to evaluate the LA function in patients with non-obstructive HCM (NOHCM) utilizing cardiovascular magnetic resonance feature tracking (CMR-FT). METHODS: Thirty-three patients with NOHCM and 28 healthy controls were studied. The global and regional LA function and left ventricular (LV) function were compared between the two groups. The following LA global functional parameters were quantitively analyzed: reservoir function (total ejection fraction [LA total EF], total strain [εs], peak positive strain rate [SRs]), conduit function (passive ejection fraction [LA passive EF], passive strain [εe], peak early-negative SR [SRe]), and booster pump function (active ejection fraction [LA active EF], active strain [εa], peak late-negative SR [SRa]). The LA wall was automatically divided into 6 segments: anterior, antero-roof, inferior, septal, septal-roof and lateral. Three LA strain parameters (εs, εe, εa) and their corresponding strain rate parameters (SRs, SRe, SRa) during the reservoir, conduit and booster pump LA phases were segmentally measured and analyzed. RESULTS: The LA reservoir (LA total EF: 57.6 ± 8.2% vs. 63.9 ± 6.4%, p < 0.01; εs: 35.0 ± 12.0% vs. 41.5 ± 11.2%, p = 0.03; SRs: 1.3 ± 0.4 s- 1 vs. 1.5 ± 0.4 s- 1, p = 0.02) and conduit function (LA passive EF: 28.7 ± 9.1% vs. 37.1 ± 10.0%, p < 0.01; εe: 18.7 ± 7.9% vs. 25.9 ± 10.0%, p < 0.01; SRe: - 0.8 ± 0.3 s- 1 vs. -1.1 ± 0.4 s- 1, p < 0.01) were all impaired in patients with NOHCM when compared with healthy controls, while LA booster pump function was preserved. The LA segmental strain and strain rate analysis demonstrated that the εs, εe, SRe of inferior, SRs, SRe of septal-roof, and SRa of antero-roof walls (all p < 0.05) were all decreased in the NOHCM cohort. Correlations between LA functional parameters and LV conventional function and LA functional parameters and baseline parameters (age, body surface area and NYHA classification) were weak. The two strongest relations were between εs and LA total EF(r = 0.84, p < 0.01), εa and LA active EF (r = 0.83, p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with healthy controls, patients with NOHCM have LA reservoir and conduit dysfunction, and regional LA deformation before LA enlargement. CMR-FT identifies LA dysfunction and deformation at an early stage.  "
A novel miRNA located in the GATA4 gene regulates the expression of IGF-1R and AKT1/2 genes and controls cell proliferation.  ;GATA4 gene is a zinc-finger transcription factor known to be involved in cardiogenesis and the progression of different cancer types. Its diverse functions might be attributed to noncoding RNAs that could be embedded within its sequence. Here, we predicted a stable RNA stem-loop structure that is located in the second intron of the GATA4 gene. Available microRNA (miRNA) sequencing data and molecular genetics tools confirmed the identity of a mature miRNA (named GATA4-miR1) originating from the predicted stem-loop. In silico analysis predicted IGF-1R and AKT1/2 genes as potential targets for GATA4-miR1. Indeed, direct interactions between GATA4-miR1 and 3' untranslated regions sequences of IGF-1R and AKT1/2 genes were documented by dual luciferase assay. In addition, overexpression of GATA4-miR1 in SW480 cells resulted in the reduction of IGF-1R and AKT1/2 genes' expression, detected by reverse transcription quantitative (RT-q) polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis. This observation was consistent with a deduced negative correlation between the expression patterns of GATA4-miR1 and IGF-1R genes during cardiomyocyte differentiation. Moreover, overexpressing GATA4-miR1 in SW480 and PC3 cells resulted in a significant increase of the sub-G1 population in both cell lines, as detected by propidium iodide flow cytometry. Further analysis by 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay indicated a reduction in the survival and proliferation rates of SW480 cells overexpressing GATA4-miR1, but no impact was observed on apoptosis progression, as indicated by Annexin-V flow cytometry. Overall, GATA4-miR1 represents a promising candidate for further research in the fields of cancer and cardiovascular therapeutics.  
Echocardiographic discrepancies in severity grading of aortic valve stenosis with left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) cut-off values in an Asian population.  ;Inconsistencies in grading of aortic stenosis (AS) severity have been reported. However, it remains to be studied in an Asian population. We investigated consistency of grading AS severity at various left ventricular outflow tract diameter (LVOTd) categories, and postulated alternative cut-offs for more consistent grading of AS severity. Consecutive Asian patients (n = 350) with index echocardiographic diagnosis of severe AS were divided them into three groups based on LVOTd: 'small' (< 20 mm), 'average' (20-22 mm) and 'large' (> 22 mm). In each group, the consistency of flow-dependent (transaortic mean pressure gradient (MG)) and flow-independent parameters (AVA) were used for classification of AS severity. Of 350 patients, 51.7% had small LVOTd, while 30.8% and 17.5% had average and large LVOTd respectively. Consistent grading by LVOTd based on AVA and MG, was seen in 33.7% of patients with small, 47.6% with average, 57.7% with large LVOTd. When an AVA cut-off of 0.9 cm2 was used, consistent grading improved to 38.0% in small, 56.5% in average and 70.0% in large LVOTd. At an AVA cut-off of 0.8 cm2, there was further incremental improvement in the small LVOTd group to 54.1% (p < 0.05). In conclusion, current severe AS guidelines are most inconsistent with those in the small LVOTd group. With majority of the study's Asian population having small LVOTd, this raises concerns that current AS guidelines may overestimate the severity of AS in the Asian cohort. Improved consistency in echocardiographic grading may be attained with a lower AVA cut-off in this Asian cohort.

Surgical management of mitral annular calcification.  ;PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The aim of the article is to discuss different therapeutic options for patients with severe mitral valve dysfunction because of mitral annular calcification (MAC), including mitral valve repair, conventional mitral valve replacement, percutaneous transcatheter mitral valve replacement (TMVR), and hybrid procedures. RECENT FINDINGS: Optimal management of severe mitral valve disease because of MAC remains challenging. Various 'resect' or 'respect' repair strategies have been standardized and are applicable in eligible patients. Mitral valve replacement with a standard surgical bioprosthesis is often possible in nonrepair candidates, especially with noncircumferential MAC. TMVR has evolved as a feasible option for anatomically and/or clinically prohibitive open-surgery cases, with the caveat of strict anatomic eligibility criteria. Hybrid TMVR provides the advantages of both open-surgery and TMVR and has emerged as a promising alternative in select patients. SUMMARY: Surgical management of MAC and severe mitral valve disease continues to evolve. The addition of transcatheter valve options may benefit many patients previously considered inoperable and are now candidates for intervention. This review will summarize state-of-the-art management options for patients with MAC.  
Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment in Cardiovascular Disease.  ;"Frailty and cardiovascular disease (CVD) are both highly prevalent in older adults. Cardiovascular disease has been identified as the most frequent cause of death, while frailty has been identified as one of geriatric giants characterized by decreased physiological reserves and increased vulnerability. However, the exact pathobiological links between the two conditions have not been fully elucidated. Consequently, we observe a relevant difficulty not only in accurately defining cardiovascular risk in vulnerable elderly patients (and the other way around), but also a lack of consensus regarding CVD management in the very old. Nowadays, considering the enormous technical innovation, many elderly patients, if appropriately selected, could be eligible even for the most complex treatments, including invasive cardiological procedures. Identification of frail patients at risk of negative outcomes can allow the customization of therapeutic interventions in elderly patients with CVD, allowing the elderly who can benefit from them to undergo even invasive procedures and avoiding futile or dangerous treatments for the most vulnerable patients. A large number of tools and definitions for assessing frailty have been proposed; different scales and assessment tools can be useful for different purposes, but at present there is no clear indication for their use in CVD. In this chapter, we will describe the main geriatric approach to ascertain frailty, the assessment tools used in patients with cardiovascular diseases, and propose an operational strategy to evaluate frailty and identify patients eligible for pharmacologic or surgical interventions.

Right ventricular free wall strain predicts functional capacity in patients with repaired Tetralogy of Fallot.  ;To investigate the role of right ventricular free wall strain (RVFWSL) to predict low functional capacity in repaired tetralogy of Fallot (rTOF). We prospectively enrolled 33 patients with rTOF with moderate to severe PR who underwent rest and peak exercise echocardiography on a semisupine cycloergometer. Conventional function and strain imaging parameters of both ventricles were measured. Patients performing < 7 METS were defined to have low functional capacity. Logistic regression was used to identify parameters associated with low functional capacity. Eleven patients (33.3%) had low functional capacity. These patients were shorter (height 155 ± 7 vs 163 ± 9 cm, p = 0.023), more frequently female (27.3 vs 72.7%, p = 0.024) and had history of Blalock-Taussig shunt (45.5 vs 9.1%, p = 0.027). On multivariate analysis RVFWSL was the only predictor of low functional capacity OR 1.39 (CI 95%, 1.06-1.83., p = 0.018) per % change. A RVFWSL < 17% (absolute value) had an AUC of 0.785, sensitivity of 81.8% and specificity of 77.3% to predict low functional capacity. Right ventricular free wall strain is an independent predictor of low functional capacity in repaired tetralogy of Fallot with moderate to severe PR. A value < 17% might be useful in deciding when to perform pulmonary valve replacement, when functional capacity cannot be objectively measured.  
4D flow vs. 2D cardiac MRI for the evaluation of pulmonary regurgitation and ventricular volume in repaired tetralogy of Fallot: a retrospective case control study.  ;Lengthy exams and breath-holding limit the use of pediatric cardiac MRI (CMR). 3D time-resolved flow MRI (4DF) is a free-breathing, single-sequence exam that obtains magnitude (anatomic) and phase contrast (PC) data. We compare the accuracy of gadobenate dimeglumine-enhanced 4DF on a 1.5 T magnet to 2D CMR in children with repaired tetralogy of Fallot (rTOF) to measure pulmonary net flow (PNF) as a reflection of pulmonary regurgitation, forward flow (FF) and ventricular volumetry. Thirty-four consecutive cases were included. 2D PCs were obtained at the valve level. Using 4DF, we measured PNF at the valve and at the main and branch pulmonary arteries. PNF measured at the valve by 4DF demonstrated the strongest correlation (r = 0.87, p < 0.001) and lowest mean difference (3.5 ± 9.4 mL/beat) to aortic net flow (ANF). Semilunar FF and stroke volume of the respective ventricle demonstrated moderate-strong correlation by 4DF (r = 0.66-0.81, p < 0.001) and strong correlation by 2D (r = 0.81-0.84, p < 0.001) with similar correlations and mean differences between techniques (p > 0.05). Ventricular volumes correlated strongly between 2D and 4DF (r = 0.75-0.96, p < 0.001), though 4DF overestimated right ventricle volumes by 11.8-19.2 mL/beat. Inter-rater reliability was excellent for 2D and 4DF volumetry (ICC = 0.91-0.99). Ejection fraction moderately correlated (r = 0.60-0.75, p < 0.001) with better reliability by 4DF (ICC: 0.80-0.85) than 2D (ICC: 0.69-0.89). 4DF exams were shorter than 2D (9 vs. 71 min, p < 0.001). 4DF provides highly reproducible and accurate measurements of flow with slight overestimation of RV volumes compared to 2D in pediatric rTOF. 4DF offers important advantages in this population with long-term monitoring needs.  
Hemodynamic performance and incidence of patient-prosthesis mismatch of small-sized Trifecta pericardial aortic valves.  ;OBJECTIVES: Small-sized bioprosthetic valves are sometimes associated with suboptimal hemodynamic performance, leading to a patient-prosthesis mismatch. Trifecta pericardial valves are designed to improve hemodynamic performance. The purpose of this study was to investigate the hemodynamic properties of small-sized Trifecta valves and their efficacy in preventing a patient-prosthesis mismatch. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of 108 patients undergoing surgical aortic valve replacement with a Trifecta valve of 23 mm or less in a single Japanese institution. The hemodynamic performance was evaluated with an echocardiography examination in all patients after surgery, and the development of a patient-prosthesis mismatch was judged with the measured in vivo indexed effective orifice area. RESULTS: There was one early and seven late mortalities. There were no valve explants due to structural valve deterioration. Postoperative mean pressure gradients of 19-, 21-, and 23-mm valves were 15.1, 11.4, and 9.0 mmHg, respectively. The effective orifice area of 19-, 21-, and 23-mm valves was 1.41, 1.69, and 1.78 cm2, respectively. Patient-prosthesis mismatch occurred in 14 patients (1 severe and 13 moderate) and the incidence was 13.0% (15.4% in 19 mm, 18.0% in 21 mm, and 3.3% in 23 mm). CONCLUSIONS: The small-sized Trifecta valves showed excellent hemodynamic performance and were associated with a low incidence rate of patient-prosthesis mismatch.  
Outcomes of Supra-annular Mechanical Atrioventricular Valve Replacement with Polytetrafluoroethylene Graft in Infants and Children.  ;Despite improvements in valve repair techniques, conditions in which infants and children need for mechanical valve replacement (MVR) are still present. We analyzed supra-annular MVR outcomes in infants and children with small annulus and compared them with conventional annular MVR outcomes. Data were collected retrospectively from medical records of infants and children (weighing < 20 kg) who underwent atrioventricular valve replacement with mechanical valve in Seoul National University Children's Hospital between December 1984 and January 2019. We identified 8 patients (median age 20 months, median weight 10.2 kg) who underwent supra-annular MVR with polytetrafluoroethylene graft (supra-annular group). The patients were diagnosed with congenital mitral valve malformation (5 patients), complete atrioventricular septal defect (2 patients), and functional single ventricle (1 patient). The implanted mechanical valve size ranged from 16 to 23 mm. Thirty-three patients (median age 40 months, median weight 13 kg) underwent conventional annular MVR (annular group). The survival rate was not significantly different between the supra-annular and annular groups (75.0 vs 78.8%, P = 0.816). In patients with biventricular repair (7 patients with supra-annular MVR and 28 patients with annular MVR), mechanical valve-to-mitral valve annulus size ratio was higher in the supra-annular group than in the annular group (1.24 ± 0.30 vs 0.96 ± 0.22, P = 0.035). No coronary complication or heart block were observed in the supra-annular group. Supra-annular MVR with polytetrafluoroethylene graft may be a feasible surgical option in children with a small annulus when valve repair is unsuccessful.  
Inhibition of miR‑155‑5p attenuates the valvular damage induced by rheumatic heart disease.  ;Autoimmunity is involved in the valvular damage caused by rheumatic heart disease (RHD). Increased evidence has linked microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) to autoimmune disease. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and sphingosine‑1‑phosphate receptor 1 (S1PR1) and suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) have been widely studied for their roles in autoimmunity and inflammation. Thus, the current study aims to investigate the role played by miR‑155‑5p in RHD‑induced valvular damage via the S1PR1, SOCS1/STAT3 and interleukin (IL)‑6/STAT3 signaling pathways. An RHD rat model was induced by inactivated Group A streptococci and complete Freund's adjuvant. A recombinant adeno‑associated virus (AAV‑miR155‑inhibitor) was used to inhibit the expression of miR‑155‑5p in the heart. Inflammation and fibrosis were assessed by hematoxylin and eosin staining and Sirius red staining. The expression of miR‑155‑5p in valvular tissues and serum exosomes was detected by reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR. S1PR1, SOCS1, STAT3, phosphorylated STAT3, IL‑6 and IL‑17 protein expression was detected by western blotting and immunohistochemistry. The relationships between miR‑155‑5p and S1PR1 and SOCS1 were detected by dual luciferase assays. Cytokine concentrations were measured by ELISA. The expression of miR‑155‑5p in valve tissues and serum exosomes was increased along with decreased S1PR1 and activated SOCS1/STAT3 signaling in the RHD model. The expression of IL‑6 and IL‑17 was increased in the valves and the serum. Dual luciferase assays showed that miR‑155‑5p directly targeted S1PR1 and SOCS1. Inhibition of valvular miR‑155‑5p through AAV pretreatment increased S1PR1 expression and inhibited activation of the SOCS1/STAT3 signal pathway as a result of attenuated valvular inflammation and fibrosis as well as a decrease in IL‑6 and IL‑17 in the valves and serum. These results suggest that inhibition of miR‑155‑5p can reduce RHD‑induced valvular damage via the S1PR1, SOCS1/STAT3 and IL‑6/STAT3 signaling pathways.  
Hybrid Minimally Invasive Approach for Combined Obstructive Coronary Artery Disease and Severe Aortic Stenosis.  ;OBJECTIVE: There is a high prevalence of concomitant coronary artery disease (CAD) and aortic stenosis (AS), and these conditions can be treated with a variety of invasive and/or percutaneous approaches. The aim of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility, efficacy, and safety of a staged transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) after a hybrid minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass surgery (MIDCAB) to treat combined complex CAD and AS. METHODS: Six patients with concomitant CAD and severe AS underwent staged treatment of their CAD with MIDCAB and TAVR. All patients had significant complex left main or left anterior descending artery (LAD) stenosis deemed to be not amenable to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). RESULTS: The average syntax score was 22±8 and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons score for surgical AVR was 8±3%. All patients underwent a single vessel MIDCAB for revascularization of the LAD (three patients required additional PCI for non-LAD disease). Two patients had pre-TAVR balloon aortic valvuloplasty and one patient also required treatment of severe mitral valve regurgitation with percutaneous edge-to-edge repair (the MitraClip). There was no intraprocedural or hospital mortality. No neurological deficits or vascular complications were recorded. CONCLUSIONS: A hybrid staged approach for combined complex CAD and severe AS with MIDCAB, PCI, and TAVR is a valid option in high-risk patients. The order and timing of these procedures must be tailored to the patient's clinical symptoms, stability, and severity of disease.  
NFκB (Nuclear Factor κ-Light-Chain Enhancer of Activated B Cells) Activity Regulates Cell-Type-Specific and Context-Specific Susceptibility to Calcification in the Aortic Valve.  ;OBJECTIVE: Although often studied independently, little is known about how aortic valve endothelial cells and valve interstitial cells interact collaborate to maintain tissue homeostasis or drive valve calcific pathogenesis. Inflammatory signaling is a recognized initiator of valve calcification, but the cell-type-specific downstream mechanisms have not been elucidated. In this study, we test how inflammatory signaling via NFκB (nuclear factor κ-light-chain enhancer of activated B cells) activity coordinates unique and shared mechanisms of valve endothelial cells and valve interstitial cells differentiation during calcific progression. Approach and Results: Activated NFκB was present throughout the calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) process in both endothelial and interstitial cell populations in an established mouse model of hypercholesterolemia-induced CAVD and in human CAVD. NFκB activity induces endothelial to mesenchymal transformation in 3-dimensional cultured aortic valve endothelial cells and subsequent osteogenic calcification of transformed cells. Similarly, 3-dimensional cultured valve interstitial cells calcified via NFκB-mediated osteogenic differentiation. NFκB-mediated endothelial to mesenchymal transformation was directly demonstrated in vivo during CAVD via genetic lineage tracking. Genetic deletion of NFκB in either whole valves or valve endothelium only was sufficient to prevent valve-specific molecular and cellular mechanisms of CAVD in vivo despite the persistence of a CAVD inducing environment. CONCLUSIONS: Our results identify NFκB signaling as an essential molecular regulator for both valve endothelial and interstitial participation in CAVD pathogenesis. Direct demonstration of valve endothelial cell endothelial to mesenchymal transformation transmigration in vivo during CAVD highlights a new cellular population for further investigation in CAVD morbidity. The efficacy of valve-specific NFκB modulation in inhibiting hypercholesterolemic CAVD suggests potential benefits of multicell type integrated investigation for biological therapeutic development and evaluation for CAVD.  
Pharmacotherapy for the treatment of obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  ;Introduction: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is one of the most common genetic heart diseases and represents a leading cause of sudden cardiac death as well as a prevalent cause of heart failure and stroke. HCM is characterized by a very complex pathophysiology, consisting of heterogeneous clinical manifestations and natural history. Left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction has been considered the most knowable feature of HCM since the initial clinical descriptions of the disease.Areas covered: In this review, the authors discuss the most recent reports on the pharmacological treatment of obstructive HCM, mainly based on three different levels of intervention: control of symptoms, cardiac metabolism modulation and disease-modifying approaches, including genetic preventive therapies.Expert opinion: There are presently limited data supporting pharmacological interventions for this complex disease. However, an improved understanding of HCM pathophysiology will allow the development of novel treatment options. Two important key messages are to further study drugs with negative but limited previous results and to design new and larger trials for those molecules that have already produced positive results in HCM, especially for pressure gradients and symptoms control.  
The MitraClip Procedure in Patients With Moderate Resting but Severe Exercise-Induced Mitral Regurgitation.  ;"BACKGROUND: Optimal timing for percutaneous mitral regurgitation (MR) treatment using MitraClip (Abbott Vascular) remains unclear. We evaluated the outcome after MitraClip in patients with moderate resting MR, progressing to severe exercise- induced MR (MR2+) compared to patients with severe resting MR (MR3). METHODS: We retrospectively investigated 221 patients undergoing MitraClip. All-cause deaths and heart failure (HF) hospitalizations were assessed as the combined primary endpoint. RESULTS: We identified 55 MR2+ and 166 MR3 patients. At baseline, MR3 patients showed higher STS scores (6.7 ± 7.3 vs 4.4 ± 5.5; P<.01), more HF hospitalizations in the 2 years prior to the procedure (51% vs 29%; P<.01), worse left ventricular ejection fraction (44.9 ± 16.5% vs 52.5 ± 14.3%; P<.01), larger left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDd; 57.0 ± 9.3 mm vs 51.7 ± 8.2 mm; P<.001), and larger left atrial volumes (118.3 ± 55.8 mL vs 98.6 ± 35.2 mL; P=.02). Long-term outcome according to the combined endpoint was significantly worse in MR3 patients (P=.01). HF hospitalizations significantly declined in both groups 2 years after MitraClip (P<.001 in MR3 patients, P=.03 in MR2+ patients). Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed LVEDd (hazard ratio, 1.035; 95% confidence interval, 1.005-1.066; P=.02) and previous HF hospitalizations (hazard ratio, 1.813; 95% confidence interval, 1.016-3.234; P=.04) as strong outcome predictors. CONCLUSIONS: Symptomatic patients with moderate resting and severe exercise-induced MR during handgrip echocardiography may represent an MR cohort at an earlier disease stage with improved treatment response following MitraClip implantation compared to individuals with severe resting MR. Larger left ventricular diameters and preprocedural HF hospitalizations were identified as independent adverse outcome predictors.  "

Concomitant Wrapping of a Moderately Dilated Ascending Aorta during Aortic Valve Replacement: Postoperative Remodeling of a Distinctive Aorta.  ;PURPOSE: The long-term outcomes of aortic wrapping in patients with ascending aortic aneurysms, which are rare, but can be fatal, remain poorly understood. This retrospective study analyzed the outcomes of aortic diameter, including aortic root, ascending aorta, and proximal arch diameters, after aortic wrapping during aortic valve replacement surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety-six patients with ascending aortic dilation of 40-55 mm who underwent aortic wrapping during aortic valve replacement were selected for this study. Aortic diameter was measured at three levels perioperatively and at follow-up (median time of 9.1±4.2 years). A linear mixed-effects model was used to analyze aortic diameter expansion. RESULTS: Freedom from adverse aortic events (aortic dissection or rupture, reoperation, or sudden death) at 10 years was 97.9%. No significant dilation at the level of the sinuses of Valsalva (0.069 mm/year, p=0.524) or ascending aorta (0.152 mm/year, p=0.124) was observed. Significant dilation occurred at the proximal aortic arch (0.343 mm/year, p=0.006). Subgroup analysis with a multivariable linear mixed model identified initial ascending aortic diameter to be a significant predictor of proximal arch dilation (p=0.032). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed that the cut-off for the prediction of proximal arch redilation was an initial mid-ascending aortic diameter of 47.0 mm (area under the curve 0.747, 90% confidence interval 0.613-0.881, p=0.023). CONCLUSION: Aortic wrapping could be considered as a safe and long-term therapeutic option. Redilation of the proximal arch should be carefully observed during long-term follow-up.  
Immediate and Evolutionary Recovery of Left Ventricular Diastolic Function after Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: Comparison with Surgery.  ;"PURPOSE: We aimed to compare the effect of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and surgical aortic valve replacement (sAVR) on recovery of left ventricular (LV) diastolic function and afterload through serial echocardiographic examinations in patients with symptomatic high-risk severe aortic stenosis during early follow-up. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We included 38 patients undergoing TAVR (mean age, 80±6 years; male:female=18:20) and 27 patients undergoing sAVR (mean age, 78±3 years; male:female=12:15). We compared changes in the LV diastolic function and afterload before, immediately after, and 3 months after the procedure using serial transthoracic echocardiography. RESULTS: Immediately after the procedure, 16 (42%) and 3 (11%) patients in the TAVR and sAVR groups, respectively, showed rapid improvement in diastolic filling patterns. E wave to e' ratio (E/e') and right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) decreased significantly in the TAVR group (E/e': TAVR, from 24.6±12.9 to 20±9.5, p=0.048 vs. sAVR, from 21.5±9.4 to 20.64±6.4, p=0.361; RVSP: TAVR, 38.4±17.2 vs. 34±12.4, p=0.032 vs. sAVR, 32.2±11.7 vs. 30±6.8, p=0.27). After 3 months, diastolic grade distribution, E/e', and RVSP were similar. Valvuloarterial impedance significantly decreased immediately after the procedure in both groups (TAVR, from 5.1±1.4 to 3.1±1.0 vs. sAVR, from 4.5±1.5 to 3.1±0.8 mm Hg · mL⁻¹ · m⁻², p=0.001), but after 3 months, decreases were greater in the sAVR group (from 3.1±0.8 to 2.2±1.5 mm Hg · mL⁻¹ · m⁻², p=0.093). CONCLUSION: LV diastolic function improved more rapidly and earlier in patients treatment with TAVR than in patients treated with sAVR. These results might explicate the remarkable clinical improvement in improvements in advanced diastolic dysfunction immediately after the TAVR procedure than sAVR.  "

Baseline left ventricular diastolic dysfunction affects midterm mortality after transcatheter aortic valve implantation.  ;"OBJECTIVES: To determine whether preprocedural left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction impairs midterm mortality after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) for patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS), we performed a meta-analysis of currently available evidence. METHODS: We identified all studies investigating impact of preprocedural severity of LV diastolic dysfunction on midterm (≥1-year) all-cause mortality after TAVI for patients with AS through a search of databases (MEDLINE and EMBASE) until September 2019. From each study, we extracted an adjusted (if unavailable, unadjusted) hazard ratio (HR) of midterm mortality. We pooled study-specific estimates in the random-effects model. RESULTS: Ten eligible studies with a total of 2380 patients with AS undergoing TAVI were identified. In accordance with pooled analyses, higher-grade preprocedural LV diastolic dysfunction was associated with significantly worse midterm all-cause mortality after TAVI compared to lower-grade dysfunction (HR for grade II vs I, 1.15; P = .002; HR for grade III vs I, 1.35; P = .001; HR for grade III vs II; 1.16, P = .002; HR for grade II-III vs I, II-III vs 0-I, or III vs I-II, 1.34; P < .00001 [primary meta-analysis]; HR per grade, 1.16; P = .003). No funnel plot asymmetry for the primary meta-analysis (for grade II-III vs I, II-III vs 0-I, or III vs I-II) was identified, which probably indicated no publication bias (P = .381 by the linear-regression test). CONCLUSION: Higher-grade preprocedural LV diastolic dysfunction was associated with worse midterm all-cause mortality after TAVI for patients with AS compared to lower-grade dysfunction.  "
Mesothelial/monocytic incidental cardiac excrescence in autoimmune disease.  ;Mesothelial/monocytic incidental cardiac excrescence (MICE) is a rare benign finding made of mesothelial cells, histiocytes, and fibrin, usually found during heart valve surgery. The clinical relevance resides in the potential misdiagnosis as metastatic carcinoma or arterial embolism. The pathogenesis remains uncertain, with artifactual and reactive hypotheses. Here we present a case of MICE with paradigmatic clinical, imaging, and histological features in a 28-year-old woman with undifferentiated connective tissue disease without previous cardiac catheterization with possible pathogenesis, highlighting the importance of awareness of the existence of this lesion in patients with autoimmune disease.  
Changes in left and right ventricular longitudinal function after pulmonary valve replacement in patients with Tetralogy of Fallot.  ;"Timing and indication for pulmonary valve replacement (PVR) in patients with repaired Tetralogy of Fallot (rToF) and pulmonary regurgitation (PR) are uncertain. To improve understanding of pumping mechanics, we investigated atrioventricular coupling before and after surgical PVR. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance was performed in patients (n = 12) with rToF and PR > 35% before and after PVR and in healthy controls (n = 15). Atrioventricular plane displacement (AVPD), global longitudinal peak systolic strain (GLS), atrial and ventricular volumes, and caval blood flows were analyzed. Right ventricular (RV) AVPD and RV free wall GLS were lower in patients before PVR compared with controls (P < 0.0001; P < 0.01) and decreased after PVR (P < 0.0001 for both). Left ventricular AVPD was lower in patients before PVR compared with controls (P < 0.05) and decreased after PVR (P < 0.01). Left ventricular GLS did not differ between patients and controls (P > 0.05). Right atrial reservoir volume and RV stroke volume generated by AVPD correlated in controls (r = 0.93; P < 0.0001) and patients before PVR (r = 0.88; P < 0.001) but not after PVR. In conclusion, there is a clear atrioventricular coupling in patients before PVR that is lost after PVR, possibly because of loss of pericardial integrity. Impaired atrioventricular coupling complicates assessment of ventricular function after surgery using measurements of longitudinal function. Changes in atrioventricular coupling seen in patients with rToF may be energetically unfavorable, and long-term effects of surgery on atrioventricular coupling is therefore of interest. Also, AVPD and GLS cannot be used interchangeably to assess longitudinal function in rToF.NEW & NOTEWORTHY There is a clear atrioventricular coupling in patients with Tetralogy of Fallot (ToF) and pulmonary regurgitation before surgical pulmonary valve replacement (PVR) that is lost after operation, possibly because of loss of pericardial integrity. The impaired atrioventricular coupling complicates assessment of ventricular function after surgery when using measurements of longitudinal function. Left ventricular atrioventricular plane displacement (AVPD) found differences between patients and controls and changes after PVR that longitudinal strain could not detect. This indicates that AVPD and strain cannot be used interchangeably to assess longitudinal function in repaired ToF.  "

Efficacy and Safety of Transcarotid Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: A Systematic Review.  ;"BACKGROUND: In patients who are not suitable for traditional access routes for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) due to severe peripheral vascular disease (PVD) or prohibitive surgical risk, carotid artery (CA) access is an emerging route for TAVR. This study represents the most up to date on outcomes of carotid access TAVR. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted as per the Preferred Reporting Instructions for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA). We performed a thorough electronic search through Pubmed, SCOPUS and Embase databases. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 24 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, New York, USA). RESULTS: A total of 15 non-randomized studies were included in this systematic review comprising of patients that received TAVR via 4 vascular access sites, transcarotid (TC) (N = 1035), transfemoral (TF) (N = 1116), transapical (TAP) (N = 307), transaortic (TAO) (N = 176) and transaxillary (TAX) (N = 90). In the Transcarotid cases, device success was achieved in 95.6% of patients (n = 748). The 30-day and 1-yr mortality was 4.2% and 10.5% respectively. 15.3% of patients required new pacemaker implantation. In-hospital stroke or TIA occurred in 4% of cases. 30-day stroke or TIA occurred in 5% of cases. There were no hemorrhagic strokes. 30-day Mortality was significantly higher in the Transaortic group (12.1%) compared to the Transcarotid group (2.6%) [RR = 2.93 95% CI = 1.15-7.58; p = 0.027]. There were no differences in outcomes between the Transcarotid group and the Transapical or Transaxillary groups. CONCLUSION: The most contemporary data on Carotid access TAVR shows impressive device success, low rates of stroke and pacemaker implantation and an acceptable 30-day and 1-year mortality. 30-day mortality was significantly lower in TC compared to TAO patients.

Stenting of Mobile Calcified Emboli After Failed Thrombectomy in Acute Ischemic Stroke: Case Report and Literature Review.  ;BACKGROUND: Mobile calcified emboli are a rare cause of large vessel occlusion and acute ischemic stroke and pose unique challenges to standard mechanical thrombectomy techniques. Intracranial stenting has been reported as a rescue maneuver in cases of failed mechanical thrombectomy owing to dissection or calcified atherosclerotic plaques, but its use for calcified emboli is not well described. CASE DESCRIPTION: We present 2 cases of acute ischemic stroke caused by mobile calcified emboli. Standard mechanical thrombectomy techniques using aspiration catheters and stent-retrievers failed to remove these emboli, so intracranial stenting was successfully performed in each case, albeit after overcoming unique challenges associated with the stenting of calcified emboli. We also review the literature on intracranial stenting as a salvage therapy for failed mechanical thrombectomy. CONCLUSIONS: Mobile calcified emboli are rare causes of acute ischemic stroke. Intracranial stenting can be used to successfully treat calcified emboli when mechanical thrombectomy has failed.  
Aortic Root Pressurizing Device: Aortic Valve Evaluation During Cardioplegic Arrest.  ;PURPOSE: The aortic root pressurizing device was developed for aortic valve repair surgery. It allows echocardiographic evaluation of the aortic valve during cardioplegic arrest by mimicking diastolic afterload. DESCRIPTION: This polyoxymethylene or polyether ether ketone-based device consists of a sealing cap nut, a sealing ring, a plug screw, and both a filling and a ventilation line. It can be easily connected to any size of aortic Dacron grafts. EVALUATION: The device was tested in 15 porcine hearts using a beating heart biosimulator including hemodynamic and echocardiographic monitoring. Valve competence was analyzed on both the beating and resting heart at 60 and 45 mm Hg root pressure. Aortic insufficiency was surgically induced by leaflet manipulation. Native aortic valves showed either none or trivial aortic insufficiency. After leaflet manipulation echocardiographic proof of valve insufficiency was possible in all specimen. Jet direction was identic in all cases at 60 mm Hg and 93% at 45 mm Hg root pressure. CONCLUSIONS: The aortic root pressurizing device shows highly comparable results of echocardiographic aortic valve evaluation between static and dynamic settings under experimental conditions.

Role of Subclinical Iatrogenic Hyperthyroidism in the Setting of Heart Disease and Arrhythmic Burden.  ;BACKGROUND: Subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined by a subnormal serum thyroidstimulating hormone (TSH) level with normal free thyroxine (FT4) and free triiodothyronine (FT3) levels. Its prevalence varies from 0.6% to 16% in the elderly and can increase to 20% in patients receiving thyroid hormone replacement therapy. Thyroid disease and/or replacement therapy are frequently associated with cardiovascular involvement. CASES PRESENTATION: We report three clinical cases of patients with initial subclinical hyperthyroidism and cardiological manifestations, including supraventricular and ventricular extrasystoles, prolapse of the mitral valve with severe regurgitation, higher mean heart rate and deterioration of the arrhythmias on arrhythmogenic dysplasia substrate. CONCLUSION: We discuss the role of appropriate and early correction of thyroid dysfunction in improving cardiological manifestations.  
Influence of Age on Longevity of a Stentless Aortic Valve.  ;"BACKGROUND: The longevity of a stentless valve in a younger population (20-60 years old) is unknown. METHODS: From 1992 to 2015, 1947 patients underwent aortic valve/root replacement for aortic stenosis, insufficiency, root aneurysm, or aortic dissection with stentless bioprostheses (median size, 26 mm). At operation 105 patients were <40 years old, 528 were 40 to 59, 860 were 60 to 74, and 454 were ≥75 years. The data were obtained through chart review, administered surveys, and the National Death Index. RESULTS: The 30-day mortality rate was 2.6%. During follow-up 807 patients (41%) died before reoperation, 993 (51%) were alive without reoperations because of deterioration, and 113 patients (5.8%) underwent reoperation for structural valve deterioration. After adjusting death and reoperation for non-structural valve deterioration causes as competing risks, the cumulative incidence of reoperation was significantly different between the younger groups (<40, 40-59) and the older groups (60-74, ≥75; P < .0001) but not inside the younger (<40 vs 40-59) or older (60-74 vs ≥75) group. The significant hazard ratio of reoperation for <40 versus ≥75 years of age was 12, <40 versus 60 to 74 was 4, 40 to 59 versus 60 to 74 was 3, and 40 to 59 versus ≥75 was 9 (P ≤ .01). The 10- and 15-year survival in the entire cohort was 53% and 29%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The stentless aortic valve provides satisfactory durability as a conduit for aortic valve/root replacement for patients who prefer a bioprosthesis. However it should be judiciously considered for patients younger than 60 years because of an increased incidence of reoperation for structural valve deterioration.  "

Application of Cerebral Protection System in Open Mitral Replacement with Extensive Calcified Left Atrial Thrombus.  ;Neurological complications remain a major burden in cardiac surgery, despite various intraoperative measures attempting to reduce its occurrence. Advancement of percutaneous approach in valve replacement has brought focus to the use of cerebral protection system (CPS). We reported a novel application of percutaneous CPS in open heart surgery for a patient with an extensive calcified left atrial thrombus to reduce risk of embolic stroke. Although, there is no evidence to advocate routine use of CPS in all open cardiac surgical patients, we believe it is a technically feasible and probably safe approach for neurological protection in high-risk patients.  
Antegrade Balloon Aortic Valvuloplasty for the Highly Frail Patient of Severe Aortic Stenosis Complicated with Transthyretin-type Cardiac Amyloidosis.  ;"Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is widely accepted as the treatment for patient with severe aortic stenosis (AS) whose prognosis may be over one year; however, there is no consensus concerning extremely high-risk patients whose prognosis may not exceed one year. We herein report a highly frail patient with severe AS complicated with transthyretin-type cardiac amyloidosis who had a very poor prognosis. Given his condition, we treated him by percutaneous antegrade balloon aortic valvuloplasty (A-BAV) instead of TAVI. A-BAV may be a beneficial option for treating extremely high-risk severe AS patients, including those with cardiac amyloidosis.  "
Age-Related Differences in the Effects of Initial Aortic Valve Replacement vs. Conservative Strategy on Long-Term Outcomes in Asymptomatic Patients With Severe Aortic Stenosis.  ;BACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate the effect of the initial aortic valve replacement (AVR) strategy relative to a conservative strategy on long-term outcomes stratified by age among asymptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS).Methods and Results:Among 1,808 asymptomatic severe AS patients in the CURRENT AS registry, there were 1,166 patients aged ≥75 years (initial AVR: n=124, and conservative: n=1,042), and 642 patients with age <75 years (initial AVR: n=167, and conservative: n=475). Median follow-up interval was 1,280 (interquartile range [IQR]: 1,012-1,611) days, and 1461 (IQR: 1,132-1,886) days in patients aged ≥ and <75 years, respectively. The favorable effect of the initial AVR strategy relative to conservative strategy for heart failure (HF) hospitalization was seen regardless of the age stratum (≥75 years: adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.13, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.05-0.34, and <75 years: HR 0.37, 95% CI 0.14-0.99, interaction P=0.35). However, the lower mortality risk of the initial AVR strategy relative to conservative strategy was significant in patients aged ≥75 years, but not in patients <75 years, with significant interaction (HR 0.35, 95% CI 0.20-0.61, and HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.41-1.16, interaction P=0.016). CONCLUSIONS: The benefit of initial AVR in reducing HF hospitalization in asymptomatic patients with severe AS was consistently seen regardless of age. The magnitude of mortality benefit of initial AVR was greater in super-elder patients than in non-super-elder patients.  
Aortic valve calcification as a risk factor for major complications and reduced survival after transcatheter replacement.  ;"BACKGROUND: Aortic valve calcification is supposed to be a possible cause of embolic stroke or subclinical valve thrombosis after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). We aimed to assess the role of aortic valve calcification in the occurrence of in-hospital clinical complications and survival after TAVR. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed preoperative contrast-enhanced multidetector computed tomography scans of patients who underwent TAVR on the native aortic valve in our center. Calcium volume was calculated for each aortic cusp, above and below the aortic annulus. Outcomes were recorded according to VARC-2 criteria. RESULTS: Overall, 581 patients were included in the study (SapienXT = 192; Sapien3 = 228; CoreValve/EvolutR = 45; Engager = 5; Acurate = 111). Median survival was 4.98 years (interquartile range 4.41-5.54). Logistic regression identified calcium load beneath the right coronary cusp in left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) as significantly associated with stroke (odds ratio [OR] 1.2; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03-1.3; p = 0.0019) and in-hospital mortality (OR 1.1; 95% CI 1.004-1.2; p = 0.04), whereas total calcium volume of the LVOT was associated with both in-hospital and 30 day-mortality (OR 1.2; 95% CI 1.01-1.4; p = 0.03, and OR 1.2; 95% CI 1.02-1.43; p = 0.029, respectively). Cox regression identified total calcium of LVOT (hazard ratio [HR] 1.18; 95% CI 1.02-1.38; p = 0.026), male sex (HR 1.88; 95% CI 1.06-3.32; p = 0.031), baseline creatinine clearance (HR 0.96; 95% CI 0.93-0.98; p < 0.001), and baseline severe aortic regurgitation (HR 7.48; 95% CI 2.76-20.26; p < 0.001) as risk factors associated with lower survival. CONCLUSION: LVOT calcification is associated with increased risk of peri-procedural stroke and mortality as well as shorter long-term survival.  "
Incomplete expansion of transcatheter aortic valves is associated with propensity for valve thrombosis.  ;OBJECTIVES: Clinical and subclinical leaflet thromboses are increasingly recognized complications following transcatheter aortic valve replacement. Identification of the risk factors is important to mitigate the occurrence of leaflet thrombosis in transcatheter aortic valves (TAVs) and ensure their long-term function. The goal of this study was to determine the effect of incomplete expansion of TAVs on the likelihood of leaflet thrombosis following transcatheter aortic valve replacement. METHODS: Using experimental and computational methods, 3-dimensional unsteady flow fields of 26-mm SAPIEN 3 valves expanded to 3 different diameters (i.e. 26.0 mm, 23.4 mm and 20.8 mm) were determined in patient-specific geometries. The diameters corresponded to 100%, 90% and 80% stent expansion, respectively. To address the potential difference in the likelihood of leaflet thrombosis, blood residence time (i.e. stasis) and viscous shear stress on the surface of TAV leaflets were quantified and compared. RESULTS: The results indicated that TAV underexpansion increased blood stasis on the TAV leaflets. Blood residence time on the surface of the leaflets after 80% and 90% TAV expansion on average was 9.4% and 4.1% more than that of the fully expanded TAV, respectively. In addition, areas of blood stasis time of more than 0.5 s, which are highly prone to platelet activation, increased linearly as the degree of TAV underexpansion increased. CONCLUSIONS: Incomplete expansion of TAVs increases blood stasis on the surface of TAV leaflets. Regions of blood stasis promote platelet activation and thrombotic events. TAV underexpansion can therefore increase the risk of leaflet thrombosis in patients with transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

Familial Mitral Arcade, Tricuspid Dysplasia, Left Ventricular Noncompaction and Short-Chain Acyl-CoA Reductase Deficiency.  ;Mitral arcade is a rare entity that is mostly reported in pediatric patients. We present the first 2 adult cases of mitral arcade in combination with tricuspid dysplasia, left ventricular noncompaction, and short-chain acyl-CoA deficiency in 2 brothers. We examined clinical and echocardiographic data on 2 brothers with a combination of short-chain acyl-CoA deficiency, mitral arcade, tricuspid dysplasia, and left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC), highlighting their clinical course and outcomes. Two-dimensional and 3-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography revealed direct attachment of the papillary muscles to the mitral leaflets, namely mitral arcade, as well as mild mitral regurgitation along with LVNC and tricuspid dysplasia. Over the past 7 years, both brothers have remained asymptomatic with excellent exercise capacity (13 and 10 metabolic equivalents (METS), respectively). Mitral and tricuspid regurgitation remain mild with unchanged left ventricular function (ejection fraction: 65% and 59%). In conclusion, we highlight 2 cases with a constellation of pathology including short-chain acyl-CoA deficiency, mitral arcade, tricuspid dysplasia, and LVNC, which has never been described before.  
Is oral anticoagulation effective in preventing transcatheter aortic valve implantation failure? A propensity matched analysis of the Italian Transcatheter balloon-Expandable valve Registry study.  ;BACKGROUND: Early hypo-attenuated leaflet thickening after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has been recently described presumably reflecting thrombus apposition. Although its clinical relevance is still unknown, oral anticoagulant therapy (OAT) led to almost complete resolution. METHODS: The retrospecitve Italian Transcatheter balloon-Expandable valve registry that included all patients undergoing balloon-expandable TAVI in 33 Italian centers. Patients discharged after TAVI with aspirin alone were compared with those assuming aspirin and OAT before and after propensity score with matching. Prosthetic heart valve dysfunction at follow-up was the primary end point. All-cause death, cardiovascular death, bleeding, vascular complications and cerebrovascular accidents at 30 days and at follow-up were the secondary ones. RESULTS: Among the 1904 patients enrolled in the Italian Transcatheter balloon-Expandable valve registry, 716 patients on OAT and aspirin or aspirin alone were identified and analyzed: 555 were on aspirin alone and 161 on OAT and aspirin. The median follow-up was 44.0 ± 12 months. After matching, risk of prosthetic valve dysfunction at follow-up did not differ between the two groups: 3.1% in patients treated with aspirin alone vs. 1.9% in those treated with OAT and aspirin, (P = 0.72). Nevertheless patients treated with aspirin alone at follow-up had a significantly lower risk of death (21 vs. 33%, P = 0.03) and major bleeding (4 vs. 14%, P = 0.04) with a similar rate of stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA) (1.2 vs. 3.1%, P = 0.45). At 30 days rates of Valve Academic Research Consortium death were similar in both groups (0.6 vs. 3.7%, P = 0.12) with higher risk of life threatening bleeding and minor vascular complications in patients on OAT and aspirin. CONCLUSION: After TAVI with Edwards Sapien valve OAT did not reduce the incidence of valve dysfunction and stroke but was responsible for mortality and bleeding increases.  
Transcriptional sex and regional differences in paired human atrial and ventricular cardiac biopsies collected in vivo.  ;Transcriptional studies of the human heart provide insight into physiological and pathophysiological mechanisms, essential for understanding the fundamental mechanisms of normal cardiac function and how they are altered by disease. To improve the understanding of why men and women may respond differently to the same therapeutic treatment it is crucial to learn more about sex-specific transcriptional differences. In this study the transcriptome of right atrium and left ventricle was compared across sex and regional location. Paired biopsies from five male and five female patients undergoing aortic valve replacement or coronary artery bypass grafting were included. Gene expression analysis identified 620 differentially expressed transcripts in atrial and ventricular tissue in men and 471 differentially expressed transcripts in women. In total 339 of these transcripts overlapped across sex but notably, 281 were unique in the male tissue and 162 in the female tissue, displaying marked sex differences in the transcriptional machinery. The transcriptional activity was significantly higher in atrias than in ventricles as 70% of the differentially expressed genes were upregulated in the atrial tissue. Furthermore, pathway- and functional annotation analyses performed on the differentially expressed genes showed enrichment for a more heterogeneous composition of biological processes in atrial compared with the ventricular tissue, and a dominance of differentially expressed genes associated with infection disease was observed. The results reported here provide increased insights about transcriptional differences between the cardiac atrium and ventricle but also reveal transcriptional differences in the human heart that can be attributed to sex.  
Thirty-day readmissions after transcatheter versus surgical mitral valve repair in high-risk patients with mitral regurgitation: Analysis of the 2014-2015 Nationwide readmissions databases.  ;OBJECTIVE: Determine the rates, reasons, predictors, and costs of 30-day readmissions following transcatheter mitral valve repair (TMVR) versus surgical mitral valve repair (SMVR) in the United States. BACKGROUND: Data on 30-day readmissions after TMVR are limited. METHODS: High-risk patients with mitral regurgitation (MR) undergoing TMVR or SMVR were identified from the 2014-2015 Nationwide Readmissions Databases. Multivariable stepwise regression models were used to identify independent predictors of 30-day readmission. Risk of 30-day readmission was compared between the two groups using univariate and propensity score adjusted regression models. RESULTS: Among 8,912 patients undergoing mitral valve repair during 2014-2015 (national estimate 17,809), we identified 7,510 (84.7%) that underwent SMVR and 1,402 (15.3%) that underwent TMVR. Thirty-day readmission rates after SMVR and TMVR were 10.7% and 11.7%, respectively (unadjusted OR 1.11, 95% CI 0.89-1.39, p = .35). After propensity score adjustment, TMVR was associated with a lower risk of 30-day readmissions compared with SMVR (adjusted OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.51-0.95, p = .02). Heart failure and arrhythmias were the leading cardiac reasons for readmission. Anemia and fluid and electrolyte disorder were independent predictors of 30-day readmission after TMVR. Demographics, comorbidities, and length of stay were independent predictors of 30-day readmission after SMVR. CONCLUSIONS: One in 10 patients are readmitted within 30 days following TMVR or SMVR. Approximately half of the readmissions are for cardiac reasons. The predictors of 30-day readmission are different among patients undergoing TMVR and SMVR, but can be easily screened for to identify patients at highest risk for readmission.

Clinical Usefulness of Pressure Recovery Adjustment in Patients with Predominantly Severe Aortic Stenosis: Asian Valve Registry Data.  ;"BACKGROUND: Adjustment for pressure recovery (PR) may reconcile discrepancies in pressure gradients measured by Doppler echocardiography and direct catheterization in patients with mild to moderately severe aortic stenosis (AS). The aim of this study was to evaluate whether PR adjustment is useful in a large cohort of predominantly patients with severe AS. METHODS: Data from 697 patients (mean age 70 ± 11 years) in the Asian Valve Registry with a mean aortic valve area (AVA) of 0.8 ± 0.3 cm2 and a mean gradient of 46 ± 21 mm Hg were analyzed. PR-adjusted AVAs were calculated using validated equations. The primary outcome included aortic valve replacement, all-cause mortality, and hospitalization for heart failure during the median follow-up period of 2.9 years. RESULTS: Before PR adjustment, 521 patients showed AVA values of ≤1.0 cm2, and after PR adjustment, 129 (24.8%) were reclassified to moderate AS with a mean AVA of 1.1 ± 0.1 cm2. PR adjustment decreased the frequency of low-gradient severe AS (AVA ≤ 1.0 cm2 and mean gradient < 40 mm Hg) from 22.4% (156 of 697) to 10.2% (71 of 697). Most reclassification (>95%) occurred in patients with aortic dimensions < 3.5 cm, mean gradients < 60 mm Hg, or AVAs between 0.8 and 1.0 cm2. Patients with reclassification to moderate AS after PR adjustment showed higher 4-year clinical event-free survival rates (46.2 ± 4.9% vs 14.6 ± 2.1% in patients with severe AS after PR adjustment, P < .001). Cox regression analysis showed that reclassification after PR adjustment had additive value to predict the primary outcome (hazard ratio, 0.678; 95% CI, 0.467-0.985; P = .041) and aortic valve replacement (hazard ratio, 0.663; 95% CI, 0.440-0.998; P = .049). CONCLUSIONS: Clinically relevant PR frequently occurs in patients with moderate to severe AS. PR adjustment has prognostic implications, and accurate classification of severe AS can help prevent discordant AS grading.  "
High Blood Pressure and Cardiovascular Disease.  ;Fragmented investigation has masked the overall picture for causes of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Among the risk factors for CVD, high blood pressure (BP) is associated with the strongest evidence for causation and it has a high prevalence of exposure. Biologically, normal levels of BP are considerably lower than what has typically been characterized as normal in research and clinical practice. We propose that CVD is primarily caused by a right-sided shift in the population distribution of BP. Our view that BP is the predominant risk factor for CVD is based on conceptual postulates that have been tested in observational investigations and clinical trials. Large cohort studies have demonstrated that high BP is an important risk factor for heart failure, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease, heart valve diseases, aortic syndromes, and dementia, in addition to coronary heart disease and stroke. In multivariate modeling, the presumed attributable risk of high BP for stroke and coronary heart disease has increased steadily with progressive use of lower values for normal BP. Meta-analysis of BP-lowering randomized controlled trials has demonstrated a benefit which is almost identical to that predicted from BP risk relationships in cohort studies. Prevention of age-related increases in BP would, in large part, reduce the vascular consequences usually attributed to aging, and together with intensive treatment of established hypertension would eliminate a large proportion of the population burden of BP-related CVD.  
Risk estimation model for acute kidney injury defined by KDIGO classification after heart valve replacement surgery.  ;OBJECTIVES: Risk prediction for postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) has a great clinical value to achieve early prevention strategies for AKI after cardiac surgery. We aimed to identify the patients at risk of postoperative AKI and to create patient risk group for AKI using a simple risk estimation model in patients undergoing heart valve replacement surgery. METHODS: Between May 2008 and February 2018, 219 consecutive patients undergoing heart valve replacement surgery with or without concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting (CAGB) were included in the study. To define postoperative AKI and its severity stages, KDIGO classification which is the latest uniform classification for determining and staging of AKI was used. RESULTS: The AKI incidence was 38.8%, and Class I was the dominant stage (43.5%). Postoperative AKI development was associated with a serious of postoperative adverse events, early, and long-term mortality. Furthermore, the incidence of poor outcomes increased with the degree of AKI severity. The presence of older age, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, NYHA class III-IV, diabetes, concomitant CABG, and longer cardiopulmonary bypass duration was found to be an independent predictor for AKI, and each factor was scored according to the integer value of their odds ratio, based on risk estimation model. Patient risk groups from mild to severe for AKI development were created. The patients at severe risk group exhibited a significantly higher rate of adverse events, early, and long-term mortality as well as lower long-term survival rates. CONCLUSIONS: The risk estimation model is a useful tool to identify the patients at risk and to create patient risk groups for postoperative AKI defined by KDIGO after heart valve replacement surgery.  
Measurement errors in serial echocardiographic assessments of aortic valve stenosis severity.  ;Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) evaluation of aortic stenosis (AS) is routinely performed using the continuity equation. Inaccurate measurements of the left ventricular (LV) outflow tract (LVOT) diameter are considered the most common source of error in AS grading. We hypothesized that inconsistency in LVOT velocity time integral (VTI) is an under-recognized cause of AS assessment error. We sought to determine which parameters contribute most towards inconsistencies in AS grading by studying the prevalence of different errors in a historic cohort. We identified patients with mild to severe AS with multiple studies from our database from 1994 to 2018 (n = 988 patients, 2859 studies). Errors were defined when: (1) LVOT diameter changed by > 2 mm, (2) LVOT VTI changed by > 15% without change in LV function from the initial TTE, (3) aortic valve (AV) maximum velocity (Vmax), mean pressure gradient (ΔP) or AV VTI decreased by > 15% without change in LV function from prior study. The most common error was the LVOT VTI measurement with 22% prevalence. LVOT diameter, AV VTI, AV Vmax and AV ΔP measurement caused errors in < 7% studies. Patients with normal LV function and more severe AS were more likely to have LVOT VTI errors (P < 0.05). LVOT VTI is a frequent, under-recognized source of error in assessing AS. Greater attention should be directed toward the proper positioning of the pulsed Doppler sample volume, particularly in patients with higher grades of AS and normal systolic function, to ensure accurate and reproducible assessment of AS.  
Mitral Valve Surgery in the First Year of Life.  ;Data are limited on outcomes associated with mitral valve surgery in infants. Prior studies report high mortality and increased risk for late cardiac failure particularly for those with mitral stenosis. We sought to evaluate outcomes in patients with mitral stenosis (MS) or regurgitation (MR) who had mitral valvuloplasty or replacement in the first year of life. A retrospective analysis of all patients in a single institution who underwent mitral valvuloplasty or replacement in their first year of life from 2004 to 2016 (n = 25), excluding patients with single ventricle pathology or those undergoing surgery for atrioventricular canal defect, was carried out. Median age and weight at surgery were 76.5 days (range 2-329) and 4.5 kg (range 3.0-10.1), respectively. The primary mitral pathology was MR in 16 and MS in 9 patients. Median follow-up among living patients was 4 years (range 106 days-12.3 years). Overall survival was 96% at 30 days and 87.8% at 1, 5, and 10 years. There were three early deaths (12%), all within 6 weeks of surgery. There were no late deaths. Three patients required valve replacement, 1 of which had a primary mitral valve replacement and died within 30 days of surgery. Re-intervention-free survival (surgical and catheter based) was 83.8%, 73.3%, and 48.9% at 1, 5, and 10 years per Kaplan-Meier estimates. There was no difference in re-intervention-free survival between patients with MR versus MS. No risk factors for death or re-intervention were identified. Mitral valvuloplasty and replacement can be performed in infants under 1 year of age with acceptable survival and need for re-intervention.

Prognostic Impact of Ischemic Mitral Regurgitation Severity and Myocardial Infarct Quantification by Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance.  ;OBJECTIVES: This study sought to evaluate the role of cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) for the quantification of ischemic mitral regurgitation (IMR) and myocardial infarct size (MIS) in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM). This study also sought to explore the interaction between IMR severity and MIS and its association with outcomes in patients with ICM. BACKGROUND: IMR occurs secondary to a disease of the left ventricle and is associated with poor outcomes. The role of CMR for the evaluation and risk stratification of patients with ICM and IMR remains uncertain. METHODS: Consecutive patients with ICM who underwent baseline CMR were included. MIS was quantified on late gadolinium enhancement imaging as the proportion of left ventricular mass. IMR was quantified with CMR by calculating the mitral regurgitant fraction (MRFraction). Cox proportional hazards models were built to assess the association of IMR and MIS quantification with the combined endpoint of all-cause death or heart transplant. RESULTS: We evaluated 578 patients (mean age: 62 ± 11 years, 76% males). The mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 25 ± 11%, with an MIS of 24 ± 16% and MRFraction of 18 ± 17%. Over a median follow-up time of 4.9 years, 198 (34%) patients experienced death or cardiac transplant. On multivariable analysis, after comprehensive medical risk score, subsequent revascularization, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator insertion, and surgical mitral valve intervention were controlled for, the interaction of IMR severity and MIS emerged as a powerful predictor of adverse outcomes (p = 0.008). For patients with significant IMR (MRFraction: ≥35%), the hazard ratio comparing moderate MIS (15% to 29%) versus small MIS (<15%) was 1.51 (0.57 to 3.98), and the hazard ratio comparing large MIS (≥30%) versus small MIS was 5.41 (2.34 to 12.7). CONCLUSIONS: Risk associated with IMR is more comprehensively described as an interaction between IMR severity and MIS. Further studies in patients IMR using comprehensive CMR evaluation are needed to verify whether this approach can improve patient selection and procedural outcomes to address IMR.

Left Ventricular Outflow Tract Obstruction From Preserved Leaflet After Mitral Valve Replacement.  ;Left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) can be caused by multiple factors. One of the rare causes of LVOTO is preserved anterior mitral valve leaflet and chordal apparatus after mitral valve replacement. We describe a case of a patient with worsening chronic congestive heart failure secondary to LVOTO from systolic anterior motion of residual native anterior mitral leaflet. In this patient, LVOTO was surgically corrected by excision of anterior leaflet and chordal apparatus through the aortic root.  
Preventive Strategy for Reexpansion Pulmonary Edema After Minimally Invasive Cardiac Surgery.  ;Reexpansion pulmonary edema is a serious complication of minimally invasive cardiac surgery through the right minithoracotomy. As reexpansion mechanical injury and ischemia reperfusion injury to the collapsed lung are possible mechanisms, we introduced a preventive protocol that consists of intermittent ventilation of the right lung, restoration of bilateral ventilation, administration of mannitol before unclamping the aorta, and institution of mild hypothermia. Among 469 patients who underwent minimally invasive cardiac surgery, we used this protocol in 379 patients. Reexpansion pulmonary edema incidence decreased significantly from 7.8% to 2.1% (P = .006). Although further evaluation is required, our protocol may be effective in preventing reexpansion pulmonary edema.

The Association of Lipoprotein(a) Plasma Levels With Prevalence of Cardiovascular Disease and Metabolic Control Status in Patients With Type 1 Diabetes.  ;"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of the cardiovascular risk factor lipoprotein (Lp)(a) and vascular complications in patients with type 1 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients with type 1 diabetes receiving regular care were recruited in this observational cross-sectional study and divided into four groups according to their Lp(a) levels in nmol/L (very low <10, low 10-30, intermediate 30-120, high >120). Prevalence of vascular complications was compared between the groups. In addition, the association between metabolic control, measured as HbA1c, and Lp(a) was studied. RESULTS: The patients (n = 1,860) had a median age of 48 years, diabetes duration of 25 years, and HbA1c of 7.8% (61 mmol/mol). The median Lp(a) was 19 (interquartile range 10-71) nmol/L. No significant differences between men and women were observed, but Lp(a) levels increased with increasing age. Patients in the high Lp(a) group had higher prevalence of complications than patients in the very low Lp(a) group. The age- and smoking-status-adjusted relative risk ratio of having any macrovascular disease was 1.51 (95% CI 1.01-2.28, P = 0.048); coronary heart disease, 1.70 (95% CI 0.97-3.00, P = 0.063); albuminuria, 1.68 (95% CI 1.12-2.50, P = 0.01); and calcified aortic valve disease, 2.03 (95% CI 1.03-4.03; P = 0.042). Patients with good metabolic control, HbA1c <6.9% (<52 mmol/mol), had significantly lower Lp(a) levels than patients with poorer metabolic control, HbA1c >6.9% (>52 mmol/mol). CONCLUSIONS: Lp(a) is a significant risk factor for macrovascular disease, albuminuria, and calcified aortic valve disease in patients with type 1 diabetes. Poor metabolic control in patients with type 1 diabetes is associated with increased Lp(a) levels.  "
"""The post-pulmonary syndrome - results of echocardiographic driven follow up after acute pulmonary embolism"".  ";INTRODUCTION: The concept of post Pulmonary Embolism syndrome includes various combinations of functional, haemodynamic or imaging abnormalities in patients after pulmonary embolism (PE). Although residual obstruction of pulmonary vascular bed is suggested to be a major cause of post Pulmonary Embolism syndrome (post-PE syndrome) other cardiopulmonary abnormalities can be responsible for functional impairment. Therefore, we analyzed the frequency of post-PE syndrome and its potential causes. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We report data of consecutive 845 PE survivors (468 F, aged 62 ± 18 yrs) who were anticoagulated, and followed for at least 6 months. All symptomatic subjects at follow up underwent diagnostic workup. RESULTS: 35% (290/845) of PE survivors recovered functionally, while 65% patients reported a decreased exercise tolerance compatible with post-PE syndrome. One hundred and five symptomatic cases were lost to follow up. After diagnostic workup, chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) was diagnosed in 38 of 450 (8.4%) symptomatic subjects and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary disease (CTED) was diagnosed in 15/450 (3.3%) of them. Chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (EF) was found in 6.9% (31/450) of patients and 154 patients (34.2%) had leftsided diastolic dysfunction. Valve heart disease was detected in 6.2% (28/450), atrial fibrillation in 31/450 (6.9%), Other causes of reduced exercise tolerance include coronary artery disease in 31/450 (6.9%), pulmonary disease 42/450 (9.3%), morbid obesity 15/450 (3.3%), neoplasms 15/450 (3.3%), psychiatric disorders 1%, rheumatoid disease 1%, anemia 1%. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 65% of PE survivors report functional impairment, despite at least 6 months of anticoagulation. Persistent pulmonary artery thromboemboli resulting in CTEPH or CTED were detected in 7.2% of PE survivors and 11.8% of symptomatic patients. Leftsided diastolic dysfunction was the most prevalent echocardiographic abnormality, and remained the most common cause of functional limitation affected 34.2% of symptomatic cases.  
Impact of preprocedural left ventricle hypertrophy and geometrical patterns on mortality following TAVR.  ;"BACKGROUND: In contrast to surgical aortic valve replacement, left ventricle (LV) hypertrophy (LVH) had not been clearly associated with mortality following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of patients enrolled in the Israeli multicenter TAVR registry for whom preprocedural LV mass index (LVMI) data were available. Patients were divided into categories according to LVMI: normal LVMI and mild, moderate, and severe LVH. Mild LVH was regarded as the reference group. Additionally, LV geometry patterns were examined (concentric and eccentric LVH, and concentric remodeling). RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 1,559 patients, 46.5% male, with a mean age of 82.2 (±6.8) years and mean LVMI of 121 (±29) g/m2. Rates of normal LVMI and mild, moderate, and severe LVH were 31% (n = 485), 21% (n = 322), 18% (n = 279), and 30% (n = 475), respectively. Three-year mortality rates for normal LVMI and mild, moderate, and severe LVH were 19.8%, 18.3%, 23.7%, and 24.4%, respectively. Compared to mild LVH, moderate LVH and severe LVH were independently associated with an increased risk for all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 1.58, 95% CI 1.15-2.18, P = .005; HR 1.46, 95% CI 1.1-1.95, P = .009; respectively). Concentric LVH was independently associated with a decreased risk for mortality compared to normal LV geometry (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.63-0.89, P = .001). Compared to concentric LVH, eccentric LVH was independently associated with a 33% increased risk for mortality (HR 1.33, 95% CI 1.11-1.60, P = .002). CONCLUSIONS: Mild concentric LVH confers a protective effect among patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing TAVR. However, hypertrophy becomes maladaptive, and an increased baseline LVMI, eccentric pattern particularly, may be associated with all-cause mortality in this population.  "
Predicting the outcome of transcatheter mitral valve implantation using image-based computational models.  ;BACKGROUND: The appropriate placement and size selection of mitral prostheses in transcatheter mitral valve implantation (TMVI) is critical, as encroachment on the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) may lead to flow obstruction. Recent advances in computed tomography (CT) can be employed for pre-procedural planning of mitral prosthetic valve placement. This study aims to develop patient-specific computational fluid dynamics models of the left ventricle (LV) in the presence of a mitral valve prosthesis to investigate blood flow and LVOT pressure gradient during systole. METHODS: Patient-specific computational fluid dynamics simulations of TMVI with varied cardiac anatomy and insertion angles were performed (n = 30). Wide-volume full cycle cardiovascular CT images prior to TMVI were used as source anatomical data (n = 6 patients). Blood movement was governed by Navier-Stokes equations and the LV endocardial wall deformation was derived from each patient's CT images. RESULTS: The computed pressure gradients in the presence of the mitral prosthesis compared well with clinically measured gradients. Analysis of the effects of prosthetic valve angulation, aorto-mitral annular angle, ejection fraction, LV size and new LVOT area (neo-LVOT) after TMVI in silico revealed that the neo-LVOT area (p < 0.001) was the most significant factor affecting LVOT pressure gradient. Angulation of the mitral valve can substantially mitigate LVOT gradient. CONCLUSIONS: Computational fluid dynamics simulation is a promising method to aid in pre-TMVI planning and understanding the factors underlying LVOT obstruction.  
Successful cardiac surgery in a patient with Evans syndrome.  ;Evans syndrome is a rare haematological disease that may cause several complications during heart surgery. Herein we documented heart valve surgery in a patient with Evans syndrome who was receiving monoclonal antibody therapy, and valve replacement was successfully performed via prophylactic measures against haemolysis.  
Left ventricular and atrial strain imaging with cardiac computed tomography: Validation against echocardiography.  ;BACKGROUND: Data on left ventricular (LV) deformation imaging using CT angiography (CTA) are scarce and the feasibility of atrial deformation analysis by CT has not been addressed. We aimed to compare 2D echocardiographic and CT derived LV and left atrial (LA) global longitudinal strain (GLS) obtained by using a novel feature tracking algorithm in patients following transcatheter aortic valve implantation. METHODS: Twenty-eight patients were included who underwent retrospectively-gated 256-slice CTA and speckle-tracking echocardiography (STE) on the same day. CT datasets in 10% increments were reconstructed throughout the cardiac cycle. LV GLS and LA global peak reservoir strain (LA GS) was measured. RESULTS: Median absolute values for LV GLS were 19.9 [14.8-22.4] vs. 19.9 [16.8-24.7], as measured by CT vs STE, respectively (p = 0.017). We found good inter-modality correlation for LV GLS (ρ = 0.78, p < 0.05) with a mean bias of -1.6. Regarding atrial measurements, the median LA GS was 19.0 [13.5-27.3] for CT vs. 28.0 [17.5-32.6] for STE (p < 0.001) with a mean bias of -5.6 between CT and STE and a correlation coefficient of ρ = 0.87, p < 0.001. CT measurements were highly reproducible: intra-observer intra-class correlation coefficient was 0.96 for LV GLS and 0.95 for LA GS. CONCLUSION: We detected good correlation between CTA and echocardiography-based LV and LA longitudinal strain parameters. CTA provides accurate strain measurements with high reproducibility. Feature tracking-based deformation analysis could provide a clinically important addition to CT examinations by complementing anatomical information with functional data.  
TAVI Care and Cure, the Rotterdam multidisciplinary program for patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation: Design and rationale.  ;BACKGROUND: The capacity of TAVI-programs and numbers of sites performing TAVI has rapidly increased. This necessitated the initiation of the Rotterdam TAVI Care & Cure Program, aiming to improve patient-centered care during the TAVI pathway. METHODS: Consenting patients with severe aortic stenosis and an indication for TAVI will be included. The TAVI Care & Cure program will facilitate prognostic contributions to improve outcomes, patient satisfaction and quality of life in patients with valvular heart disease who are treated with a transcatheter aortic valve implantation in collaboration with the departments of cardiology, cardio-thoracic surgery, anesthesiology and geriatrics. CONCLUSION: With a single center observational registry, we aim to assess the TAVI patient clinical pathway, focusing on pre, peri and post interventional variables including functional status and HRQoL. We will evaluate the patient's complexity by applying an extended multidisciplinary approach, which includes a systematic application of geriatric assessments of frailty and cognitive function.  
Familial hypercholesterolemia and elevated lipoprotein(a): double heritable risk and new therapeutic opportunities.  ;There is compelling evidence that the elevated plasma lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] levels increase the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in the general population. Like low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles, Lp(a) particles contain cholesterol and promote atherosclerosis. In addition, Lp(a) particles contain strongly proinflammatory oxidized phospholipids and a unique apoprotein, apo(a), which promotes the growth of an arterial thrombus. At least one in 250 individuals worldwide suffer from the heterozygous form of familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH), a condition in which LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) is significantly elevated since birth. FH-causing mutations in the LDL receptor gene demonstrate a clear gene-dosage effect on Lp(a) plasma concentrations and elevated Lp(a) levels are present in 30-50% of patients with HeFH. The cumulative burden of two genetically determined pro-atherogenic lipoproteins, LDL and Lp(a), is a potent driver of ASCVD in HeFH patients. Statins are the cornerstone of treatment of HeFH, but they do not lower the plasma concentrations of Lp(a). Emerging therapies effectively lower Lp(a) by as much as 90% using RNA-based approaches that target the transcriptional product of the LPA gene. We are now approaching the dawn of an era, in which permanent and significant lowering of the high cholesterol burden of HeFH patients can be achieved. If outcome trials of novel Lp(a)-lowering therapies prove to be safe and cost-effective, they will provide additional risk reduction needed to effectively treat HeFH and potentially lower the CVD risk in these high-risk patients even more than currently achieved with LDL-C lowering alone.  
Different CMR Imaging Modalities for Native and Patch-Repaired Right Ventricular Outflow Tract Sizing: Impact on Percutaneous Pulmonary Valve Replacement Planning.  ;Percutaneous pulmonary valve replacement (PPVI) in native or patched right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) has proven to be feasible. The procedure is highly dependent on the size of the RVOT. Several methods exist to evaluate the size of the RVOT by cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR). We evaluated different CMR modalities for measuring RVOT diameters. Thirty-one consecutive patients with native or patched RVOT were retrospectively evaluated. CMR was part of follow-up of patients with corrected Tetralogy of Fallot or pulmonary stenosis with significant pulmonary regurgitation (PR). CMR included 3D-SSFP whole-heart in systole, diastole, and contrast-enhanced MR angiography (ceMRA). Diameters of the RVOT were assessed by the three sequences. Additionally, in patients who underwent cardiac catheterization (n = 11) for PPVI, vessel diameters assessed by cine-angiography were compared to CMR. Systolic diameters of RVOT were significantly larger compared to the diameters taken in diastole and ceMRA (median difference 5.0 mm and 3.8 mm). Diastolic and ceMRA diameters did not differ significantly. CMR diameters taken in systole showed no statistical difference to systolic diameters taken by cine-angiography, while diastolic and ceMRA diameters were significantly smaller. PPVI was feasible to a maximal CMR diameter of 31 mm measured by SSFP whole-heart sequence in systole. Absolute diameters of native RVOT differ depending on the CMR sequence and timing of acquisition (systolic vs diastolic gating). Diameters taken during heart catheterization by cine-angiography best correlate to systolic CMR values. Data may help to select RVOTs suitable for PPVI.  
Eccentric Enlargement of the Aortic Sinuses in Pediatric and Adult Patients with Bicuspid Aortic Valves: A Cardiac MRI Study.  ;Aortic root size and cusp fusion pattern have been related to disease outcomes in bicuspid aortic valve (BAV). This study seeks to characterize symmetry of the aortic sinuses in adult and pediatric BAV patients and its relationship to valvulopathy and root aortopathy. Aortic sinus-to-commissure (S-C) lengths were measured on cardiac MRI of adult and pediatric BAV patients with right-and-left coronary (RL) or right-and-non-coronary (RN) leaflet fusion and tricuspid aortic valve (TAV) controls. Coefficient of variance (CoV) of S-C lengths was calculated to quantify sinus asymmetry, or eccentricity. BAV cohort included 149 adults (48 ± 15 years) and 51 children (15 ± 5 years). TAV cohort included 40 adults (60 ± 13 years) and 20 children (15 ± 5 years). In adult and pediatric BAV patients, the non-fused aortic sinus was larger than either fused sinus. In RL fusion, the non-coronary S-C distance was larger than right or left S-C distances in adults (n = 121, p < 0.001) and larger than the right S-C distance in children (n = 41, p = 0.013). Sinus eccentricity (CoV) in BAV patients was higher than in TAV patients (p < 0.001) and did not correlate with age (p = 0.12). CoV trended higher in RL adults with aortic regurgitation (AR) compared to those without AR (p = 0.081), but was lower in RN adults with AR than without AR (p = 0.006). CoV did not correlate to root Z scores (p = 0.06-0.55) or ascending aortic (AAo) Z scores in adults (p = 0.45-0.55) but correlated negatively to AAo Z score in children (p = 0.005-0.03). Most adult and pediatric BAV patients with RL and RN leaflet fusion demonstrate eccentric dominance of the non-fused aortic sinus irrespective of age. The degree of eccentricity varies with valve dysfunction and BAV phenotype but does not relate to the degree of aortic root dilatation, nor does eccentricity correlate with ascending aorta dilatation in adults.  
Three-dimensional and four-dimensional flow assessment in congenital heart disease.  ;Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common form of congenital defects, with an incidence of 8 per 1000 births. Due to major advances in diagnostics, perioperative care and surgical techniques, the survival rate of patients with CHD has improved dramatically. Conversely, although 70%-95% of infants with CHD survive into adulthood, the rate of long-term morbidity, which often requires (repeat) intervention, has increased. Recently, the role of altered haemodynamics in cardiac development and CHD has become a subject of interest. Patients with CHD often have abnormal blood flow patterns, either due to the primary cardiac defect or as a consequence of the surgical intervention(s). Research suggests that these abnormal blood flow patterns may contribute to diminished cardiac and vascular function. Serial assessment of haemodynamic parameters in patients with CHD may allow for improved understanding of the often complex haemodynamics in these patients and thereby potentially guide the timing and nature of interventions with the aim of preventing progression of cardiovascular deterioration. In this article we will discuss two novel non-invasive four-dimensional (4D) techniques to evaluate cardiovascular haemodynamics: 4D-flow cardiac magnetic resonance and computational fluid dynamics. This review focuses on the additional value of these two modalities in the evaluation of patients with CHD with abnormal flow patterns, who could benefit from advanced haemodynamic evaluation: patients with coarctation of the aorta, bicuspid aortic valve, tetralogy of Fallot and patients after Fontan palliation.

A bench test study of bioprosthetic valve fracture performed before versus after transcatheter valve-in-valve intervention.  ;AIMS: Bioprosthetic valve fracture (BVF) may improve transvalvular gradients and transcatheter heart valve (THV) expansion during VIV interventions. However, the optimal timing of BVF is unknown. We assessed the impact of timing of BVF (before versus after) for valve-in-valve (VIV) intervention, on hydrodynamic function and THV expansion. METHODS AND RESULTS: Three THV designs were assessed, a 23 mm SAPIEN 3 (S3), small ACURATE neo (ACn) and 23 mm Evolut R, deployed into 21 mm Mitroflow bioprosthetic surgical valves. We evaluated each THV in three groups: 1) no BVF, 2) BVF before VIV, and 3) BVF after VIV. Hydrodynamic testing was performed using a pulse duplicator to ISO 5840:2013 standard. Transvalvular gradients were lower when BVF was performed after VIV for the S3 (no BVF 15.5 mmHg, BVF before VIV 8.0 mmHg, BVF after VIV 5.6 mmHg), and the ACn (no BVF 9.8 mmHg, BVF before VIV 8.4 mmHg, BVF after VIV 5.1 mmHg). Transvalvular gradients were similar for the Evolut R, irrespective of performance of BVF or timing of BVF. BVF performed after VIV resulted in better expansion in all three THV designs. The ACn and Evolut R samples all had a mild degree of pinwheeling, and BVF timing did not impact on pinwheeling severity. The S3 samples had severe pinwheeling with no BVF, and significant improvement in pinwheeling when BVF was performed after VIV. CONCLUSIONS: BVF performed after VIV was associated with superior THV expansion in all three THV designs tested, with lower residual transvalvular gradients in the S3 and ACn THVs. The Evolut R had similar hydrodynamic performance irrespective of BVF timing. Timing of BVF has potential implications on THV function.

Changes in the nutritional and activity status of elderly patients within 6 months of transcatheter aortic valve replacement: A mixed methods approach.  ;"AIM: Our aim was to explore changes in nutritional and activity status of patients within 6 months after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and factors affecting malnutrition post-TAVR in this cohort, and to gain understanding of their lifestyle considerations. METHODS: Using a mixed methods approach, we conducted a prospective, longitudinal survey, consisting of interviews and a questionnaire, of 50 participants aged ≥70 years (mean age, 83 years; 58.0% female) undergoing TAVR. Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA) and albumin level (to measure nutritional status) and Physical Component Summary (PCS) scores from the 36-item Short Form Health Survey (to measure activity status) were collected at pre-TAVR and 1 month and 6 months post-TAVR. Laboratory data and some index scores (e.g., the Clinical Frailty Scale [CFS] and the Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE]) assessed before TAVR were collected from medical records as related factors. RESULTS: Significant change was observed only in the MNA scores of participants who were assessed as malnourished at pre-TAVR, which improved, but did not reach normal nutritional status. Low-flow low-gradient aortic stenosis (odds ratio [OR]: 166.39, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.43-5094.43), higher CFS scores (OR: 2.58, 95% CI: 1.01-6.54), and lower MMSE scores (OR: 0.65, 95% CI: 0.43-0.99) were related to malnutrition post-TAVR. From interviews, three themes emerged: ""balancing heart-healthy lifestyle and longstanding habits,"" ""living with aging and disease"" and ""prospects for the rest of life."" CONCLUSIONS: Our results could be utilized to identify patients at risk of malnutrition post-TAVR, and to provide support with consideration of their lifestyle concerns.  "
Influence of Configuration on Stress Distribution of Pulmonary Monocusp Leaflet.  ;"PURPOSE: For the relief of right ventricular outflow tract obstruction in operative treatment of tetralogy of Fallot and other complex congenital heart diseases, transannular monocusp patch operations are often necessary to prevent right ventricular pressure overload and reduce pulmonary regurgitation. However, long-term durability of a monocusp leaflet is unsatisfactory, its failure is believed to be related to mechanical stress, whose distribution is primarily affected by geometric configurations. Therefore, the influence of several geometrical parameters on stress distribution of leaflet is investigated. METHODS: Five parameters affecting leaflet configuration were established: angle between free edge of the leaflet and vessel wall, angle formed by the two end points of free edge, length of the free edge of the leaflet, height of the leaflet, and shape of elliptic conical surface constituting the leaflet surface. The first four parameters were fixed, and two factors were defined to describe the last parameter. Seven models with different values of these factors were analyzed using finite element method at the pressure of the pulmonary artery loaded on the leaflet. RESULTS: The peak stresses of all models occurred at end points of the free edge of the leaflet (tear high-risk regions). The middle of leaflet had the greatest stress gradient and produced tissue wrinkling; this area could be the risk region of calcification. Both factors were noted to influence the stress distribution, and one of the factors could also relieve the wrinkling. CONCLUSIONS: The leaflet of model (1.2_min) had the most even stress distribution and lowest peak principal stress, which was the optimal choice among all the models.  "
"Apical variant hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ""multimodality imaging evaluation"".  ";"Apical variant hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (AHCM) is characterized by asymmetric hypertrophy of the left ventricular (LV) apex. T wave inversions of variable degree, particularly in the left precordial leads, and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) are common EKG findings in AHCM. Echocardiography is typically the initial imaging modality used in the diagnosis and evaluation of AHCM. The diagnosis is made when the LV apex has apical wall thickness of ≥ 15 mm or a ratio of apical to basal LV wall thickness of ≥ 1.3 at end-diastole. The use of microbubble contrast agents with echocardiography is helpful for visualization of the apex. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) has the advantage of a large field of view and the ability to perform tissue characterization. Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) sequences are essential in the assessment of potential areas of myocardial scarring. Cardiac computed tomography (CCT) has the advantage of being able to evaluate coronary arteries in addition to assessing cardiac anatomy and function. A ""Solar Polar"" map pattern is the characteristic feature of AHCM on myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) in cases not associated with apical aneurysm (APA). Recognition of typical perfusion patterns in AHCM patients is not only important in the diagnostic evaluation of this disease process, but also for avoiding unnecessary and costly tests. The purpose of this article is to review the imaging features of AHCM from different imaging modalities and assess the value added of each modality in the diagnosis of AHCM.  "
Predictors of pre-rehabilitation exercise capacity in elderly European cardiac patients - The EU-CaRE study.  ;"AIMS: Functional capacity is an important endpoint for therapies oriented to older adults with cardiovascular diseases. The literature on predictors of exercise capacity is sparse in the elderly population. In a longitudinal European study on effectiveness of cardiac rehabilitation of seven European countries in elderly (>65 years) coronary artery disease or valvular heart disease patients, predictors for baseline exercise capacity were determined, and reference ranges for elderly cardiac patients provided. METHODS: Mixed models were performed in 1282 patients (mean age 72.9 ± 5.4 years, 79% male) for peak oxygen consumption relative to weight (peak VO2; ml/kg per min) with centre as random factor and patient anthropometric, demographic, social, psychological and nutritional parameters, as well as disease aetiology, procedure, comorbidities and cardiovascular risk factors as fixed factors. RESULTS: The most important predictors for low peak VO2 were coronary artery bypass grafting or valve surgery, low resting forced expiratory volume, reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, nephropathy and peripheral arterial disease. Each cumulative comorbidity or cardiovascular risk factors reduced exercise capacity by 1.7 ml/kg per min and 1.1 ml/kg per min, respectively. Males had a higher peak VO2 per body mass but not per lean mass. Haemoglobin was significantly linked to peak VO2 in both surgery and non-surgery patients. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical procedures, cumulative comorbidities and cardiovascular risk factors were the factors with the strongest relation to reduced exercise capacity in the elderly. Expression of peak VO2 per lean mass rather than body mass allows a more appropriate comparison between sexes. Haemoglobin is strongly related to peak VO2 and should be considered in studies assessing exercise capacity, especially in studies on patients after cardiac surgery.  "

Perforation of a Stenotic Congenitally Bicuspid Aortic Valve Cusp by Heavy Calcium in the Other Cusp.  ;"On occasion in patients with stenotic congenitally bicuspid aortic valves (BAVs), the quantity of calcium in one of the cusps is considerably greater than in the other cusp. We examined operatively excised stenotic congenitally BAVs in 630 patients having isolated aortic valve replacement (No other cardiac valve was replaced, and none had had infective endocarditis.) Of the 630 valves, 3 contained a perforation in the mildly calcified cusp due to a large calcific ""spur"" extending across the orifice from a heavily calcified cusp. In conclusion, heavy calcific deposits in 1 of 2 BAVs may extend across the orifice causing a perforation in the noncalcified portion of the opposing cusp.  "
Reintervention After Aortic Valve Replacement: Comparison of 3 Aortic Bioprostheses.  ;"BACKGROUND: The decision to implant a biological valve prosthesis is influenced by the issue of durability. We investigated the rate and the cause of reintervention in 3 different aortic valve bioprostheses. METHODS: The study included all patients who underwent aortic valve replacement with a biological valve prosthesis between October 2009 and December 2018. Three different bioprostheses were compared: Carpentier-Edwards (CE) Magna Ease (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA), Trifecta (St. Jude Medical, St Paul, MN), and Mitroflow (LivaNova, London, United Kingdom). The primary end point was the rate of explantation. The degree of event-free survival and possible predictors for reintervention were also analyzed using Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: In total, 2004 biological aortic valves were implanted, including 923 CE, 719 Trifecta, and 362 Mitroflow bioprostheses. The CE group had a significantly higher degree of event-free survival (917 [99.3%]) compared with the Trifecta (685 [95.3%]) and Mitroflow (340 [93.9%]) groups (P < .0001). The only cause of reintervention in the CE group was prosthetic valve endocarditis (6 [100%]), whereas structural valve deterioration was the most common cause of reintervention in the Trifecta (14 [41.2%]) and Mitroflow (14 [63.6%]) groups. Cox regression analysis revealed that age (hazard ratio [HR] 0.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.9-0.9; P < .0001) and type of prosthesis (Trifecta: HR, 6.3; 95% CI, 2.6-15.2; P < .0001; Mitroflow: HR, 6.0, 95% CI, 2.4-15.1; P < .0001) were associated with lower event-free survival. CONCLUSIONS: The freedom from reintervention after implantation of the CE bioprosthesis is significantly greater than that of the Trifecta and Mitroflow bioprostheses. Further investigations with larger patient populations and long-term follow-up are required to establish their durability and long-term efficacy.  "

Effectiveness and Safety of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation in Patients With Aortic Stenosis and Variable Ejection Fractions (<40%, 40%-49%, and >50%).  ;We evaluated the safety and efficacy of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in aortic stenosis patients with mid-range ejection fraction (ASmrEF) and compared it to aortic stenosis patients with reduced ejection fraction (ASrEF) and preserved ejection fraction (ASpEF). TAVI cases were stratified by baseline ejection fraction (ASrEF, ASmrEF, ASpEF) and compared for characteristics, procedural outcomes, and change in echocardiographic parameters at 1 year and mortality over a 5-year follow-up. The final study population included 708 patients who underwent TAVI. ASmrEF patients presented with improved EF at 1-year after procedure (49.0 ± 9.8 at 1 year vs 43.0 ± 2.5 at baseline, p <0.001) and showed improvements in left ventricular (LV) diameters (LV end-diastolic diameter: 50.4 ± 6.0 at 1 year vs 53.0 ± 5.5 at baseline and LV end-systolic diameter 34.7 ± 7.8 at 1 year vs 39.5 ± 5.9 at baseline, p <0.001 for both). LVEF improved for patients with ASrEF but not in ASpEF patients. LV diameters did not improve for patients in either group. Procedural safety and success rates were similar between all heart failure groups. Survival rates over a 5-year follow-up post-TAVI were not different between patients with ASmrEF, ASrEF, and ASpEF (ASrEF 78.4%, ASmrEF 81.9%, ASpEF 78.3%, p = 0.327). TAVI for patients with ASmrEF is safe and effective and results in marked improvement of LV function and structure.

Impact of Severity of Chronic Kidney Disease on Management and Outcomes Following Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement With Newer-Generation Transcatheter Valves.  ;"BACKGROUND: The association between chronic kidney disease (CKD) and outcomes following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in the setting of newer-generation transcatheter heart valves (THVs) is not well known. Accordingly, we sought to assess the impact of CKD severity on outcomes in adults undergoing TAVR with newer-generation THVs. METHODS: The study population included 298 consecutive patients who underwent TAVR with a newer-generation THV (Sapien 3 [Edwards Lifesciences] or CoreValve Evolut R or Evolut Pro [Medtronic]) from December 2015 to June 2018 at an academic tertiary medical center. Patients were classified into three groups: group I, defined as creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≥60 mL/ min (n = 133); group II, defined as CrCl ≥30 mL/min and <60 mL/min (n = 128); and group III, defined as CrCl <30 mL/min (n = 37). RESULTS: Median length of stay was longer in groups II and III (2.0 days in group I vs 3.0 days in group II vs 4.0 days in group III; P<.01). While rates of 30-day readmission were significantly higher in groups II and III compared with group I (14.5% in group I vs 26.6% in group II vs 37.1% in group III; P<.01), rates of in-hospital and 30-day mortality and disabling stroke were similar. In multivariable analysis, CKD was independently associated with higher 30-day readmission rates (group II: odds ratio, 2.10; 95% confidence interval 1.02-4.32; group III: odds ratio, 3.52; 95% confidence interval, 1.40-8.87; group I: referent). CONCLUSIONS: In this prospective study of adults undergoing TAVR with newer-generation THVs, moderate and severe CKD was associated with a nearly 2-fold and 3-fold higher risk of 30-day readmission, respectively.

Successful treatment of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus tricuspid-valve endocarditis with dalbavancin as an outpatient in a person who injects drugs: A case report.  ;There is a paucity of literature on the use of dalbavancin, a long-acting lipoglycopeptide, in infective endocarditis. Existing case reports have investigated dalbavancin in endocarditis as a sequential treatment after clearance of bacteria from the bloodstream with conventional therapy. A 27-year-old female who injects drugs presented with fever and pleuritic chest pain and was found to have methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus tricuspid-valve endocarditis with septic pulmonary emboli. Given non-adherence with conventional therapy, she was successfully treated off-label with once-weekly dalbavancin infusions in an outpatient setting. We summarize the patient's clinical course and review published reports of endocarditis treated with dalbavancin in the peer-reviewed literature. Our case supports further investigation of outpatient dalbavancin infusions as a reasonable therapeutic alternative to standard treatment with daily intravenous therapy for serious staphylococcal infections among patients who have difficulty engaging with conventional therapy.

Burden of infective endocarditis in an Australian cohort of people who inject drugs.  ;"BACKGROUND: Infective endocarditis (IE) results in substantial morbidity and mortality in people who inject drugs (PWID). AIMS: To describe the burden of IE and its outcomes in PWID. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of adults admitted to a tertiary referral centre in Melbourne, Australia, with IE due to injection drug use from 1997 to 2015. RESULTS: Ninety-seven PWID with 127 episodes of IE were identified with a median acute inpatient stay of 37 days (1-84). Admission to an intensive care unit was required in 67/127 (53%) episodes. Twenty-seven percent (34/127) of episodes occurred in patients with a previous episode of endocarditis. One third (43/127, 34%) of episodes involved left-sided cardiac valves. Antimicrobial treatment was completed in 88 (70%) episodes. Valve surgery was performed in 25/127 (20%) episodes. Predictors of surgery in univariable analysis were left-sided cardiac involvement (risk ratio (RR) 6.0), severe valvular regurgitation (RR 2.6) and cardiac failure (RR 2.2) (all P < 0.005). Twenty (16%) episodes resulted in death. Predictors of mortality on univariable analysis were left-sided cardiac involvement (RR 6.4), and not completing treatment (RR 0.12; both P < 0.001). The average estimated cost per episode was AU$74 168. CONCLUSIONS: IE causes a considerable burden of disease in PWID, with significant healthcare utilisation and cost. Surgery and death are not infrequent complications. In addition to ensuring completion of antimicrobial therapy, strategies such as opioid maintenance programmes may be useful in improving health outcomes for PWID.  "
Transcatheter aortic valve replacement over age 90: Risks vs benefits.  ;As the population ages, clinicians will encounter a growing number of nonagenarians suffering from severe aortic stenosis who may be candidates for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). By virtue of a healthy survivor effect or a referral bias, these patients may paradoxically have greater resilience and fewer comorbidities than their octogenarian counterparts. They tend to, on average, tolerate the TAVR procedure quite well with low in-hospital and 1-year mortality rates of 5.5% and 23%, respectively. Appropriate patient selection should consider individualized estimates of procedural risk, potential for functional recovery and for improved quantity and quality of life. Frailty is much more revealing than chronological age, and it can be measured by brief tools such as the Essential Frailty Toolset. Ultimately, the process of shared decision-making is paramount to ensure that the course of action is patient-centered and balances the procedure's expected risks and benefits with the nonagenarian's preferences and values.  
3-Dimensional personalized planning for transcatheter pulmonary valve implantation in a dysfunctional right ventricular outflow tract.  ;"BACKGROUND: Identification of adequate landing zone for transcatheter pulmonary valve implantation (TPVI) is crucial to successfully treat an aneurysmatic native right ventricle outflow tract (RVOT); three-dimensional (3D) patient-tailored digital and physical printed models are available but their actual strengths and weaknesses still not well documented. The aim of the study was to tackle TPVI planning in the dysfunctional and borderline RVOT exploiting both digital and physical printed 3D patient-specific models. METHODS: Electrocardiographically gated computed tomography (CT) angiography was segmented and anatomical RVOT geometrical changes dynamically tracked throughout the cardiac cycle using in-house processing. A compliant 3D-printed model was manufactured from the diastolic rest phase to test in vitro the catheter-based procedure feasibility; results were compared against CT-derived in vivo measurements and the actual catheterization outcome. RESULTS: CT-gated analysis successfully quantified in vivo RVOT dynamic changes corroborating the feasibility of non-conventional pulmonary jailing percutaneous intervention. Clinicians used the 3D-printed model to test the steps of the jailing procedure; yet, the deformable 3D model printed at diastole underestimated the final implant dimensions obtained during cardiac catheterization by the same operators. CONCLUSIONS: Multidisciplinary synergy between CT-gated analysis and pre-procedural tests on 3D-printed phantoms can help the interventional team to tackle complex TPVI procedures. To fully exploit 3D-printed models, adequate selection of the still frame to print and tuning of printing material properties is crucial and can be aided by 3D dynamic virtual models.  "

Clinical Impact of Size, Shape, and Orientation of the Tricuspid Annulus in Tricuspid Regurgitation as Assessed by Three-Dimensional Echocardiography.  ;"BACKGROUND: Tricuspid annuloplasty for tricuspid regurgitation (TR) depends on the measurements of tricuspid annular diameter (TAD) obtained in an apical four-chamber view on two-dimensional (2D) transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). We performed a combined 2D and three-dimensional (3D) echocardiographic study to understand the impact of the size, shape, and orientation of a dilated annulus on the inconsistencies between measured 2D TTE-TAD and the actual annular diameter. METHODS: A total of 185 patients with grade ≥3+ TR and 50 controls underwent 2D TTE and 3D transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) assessment of the tricuspid valve. The 3D TEE-TAD, defined as the longest dimension, and tricuspid annulus (TA) eccentricity index, defined as the shortest/longest dimension ratio, were obtained. The angle between the major tricuspid annulus axis and interatrial septum parallel to the vertical axis (α°) was measured as an index of TA orientation. RESULTS: Compared with controls, TR subgroups had a larger α° irrespective of TR etiology and cardiac rhythm (P < .05), with the posteriorly displaced TA most frequently noted in patients with atrial fibrillation. An excellent correlation was found between 3D TEE-TAD and 2D TTE-TAD, but 2D TTE-TAD was significantly smaller than 3D TEE-TAD (35.9 ± 5.4 vs 39.8 ± 5.7 mm; P < .001; bias, 3.9 ± 2.6 mm; limits of agreement, -1.1-8.9 mm). After multivariate adjustment, a larger 3D TEE-TAD and larger absolute value of 90° - α° were independent determinants of the bias between 3D TEE-TAD and 2D TTE-TAD (both P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: The inconsistencies between measured 2D TTE-TAD and the actual annular diameter can be explained through morphologic factors such as TA size and orientation.  "
Fibrotic aortic valve disease after radiotherapy: an immunohistochemical study in breast cancer and lymphoma patients.  ;BACKGROUND: Radiation-associated aortic valve (AV) stenosis is frequently seen as a late sequela after thoracic radiotherapy (RT). Although the clinical relationship between thoracic radiotherapy and valvular dysfunction has been established, the process leading to accelerated aortic valve stenosis remains unclear. The aim of this study was to determine whether increased inflammatory cell infiltration, fibrosis, and calcification is present in aortic valves after radiotherapy at the time of aortic valve replacement. METHODS: Stenotic aortic valve specimens from 43 patients were obtained after surgical aortic valve replacement. A total 28 patients had previously undergone radiotherapy for breast cancer or malignant lymphoma. A total 15 patients were included as control. The valve leaflets were assessed by (immuno)histochemistry for inflammatory cell composition (CD3, CD20, CD68, and CD163) and extracellular matrix changes (collagen and calcification). RESULTS: Aortic valve cell density after radiotherapy for lymphoma was markedly decreased when compared with other groups. Irradiated aortic valve show similar (low) degrees of late T and B lymphocyte infiltration as control valves, whereas macrophage marker CD68 was decreased after radiotherapy for breast cancer. Collagen content was increased following radiotherapy. Aortic valves of patients with lymphoma contained significantly less calcified tissue when compared with the other groups. CONCLUSION: High-dose radiation at a young age (patients with lymphoma) results in cell loss and premature fibrotic aortic valve stenosis as opposed to the degenerative calcific stenosis observed in patients with breast cancer. Our findings suggest a possible dose-dependent effect of radiotherapy on aortic valve fibrosis. The active presence of inflammatory cells may be limited to the acute phase after radiotherapy.  
Patterns of Home Environmental Modification Use and Functional Health: The Women's Health Initiative.  ;"BACKGROUND: We examined common patterns of home environmental modification (HEM) use and associated major (including disability-, cardiovascular-, and cancer-related) health conditions and events among older women. METHODS: Women, aged 78.6 ± 6.3 years (n = 71,257), self-reported utilization of nine types of HEMs (hand rails, grab bars, ramps, nonslip surfaces, tacking carpets/rugs, decreasing clutter, increasing lighting, raised sink/counter heights, other). Concurrent history of major health conditions and events was collected. Odds ratios (ORs) were estimated based on overall HEM use and four latent classes (low HEM use [56%], rails/grab bars [20%], lighting/decluttering [18%], high HEM use [5%]), adjusted for age, marital status, race/ethnicity, education, depression, and obesity. RESULTS: Fifty-five percent of women reported using any HEM (overall), with strongest associations among disability-related conditions. Activities of daily living limitations were strongly associated with high HEM use (OR = 8.16, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 6.62-10.05), railing/grab bar use (OR = 4.02, 95% CI = 3.26-4.95), and lighting/declutter use (OR = 1.87, 95% CI = 1.40-2.50) versus low HEM use. Recent falls were positively associated with overall HEM use (OR = 1.79, 95% CI = 1.72-1.87); high HEM use (OR = 2.89, 95% CI = 2.64-3.16), railings/grab bars use (OR = 2.32, 95% CI = 2.18-2.48), and lighting/declutter use (OR = 1.93, 95% CI = 1.79-2.08) were positively associated with recent falls. Modest associations were observed between HEM use and select (ie, atrial fibrillation, heart valve disease, stroke) cardiovascular outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Among older women, disability-related conditions, including functional limitations and recent falls, were strongly associated with overall HEM use, high HEM use, and railings/grab bar use.

Baseline global longitudinal strain by computed tomography is associated with post transcatheter aortic valve replacement outcomes.  ;BACKGROUNDS: Subclinical myocardial dysfunction detected by global longitudinal strain (GLS) using echocardiography is associated with poor outcomes in patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) despite normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Computed tomography angiography derived GLS (CTA-GLS) has recently shown to be feasible, however the prognostic value remains unclear in severe AS patients treated with transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). METHODS: We analyzed consecutive patients who underwent TAVR with pre-TAVR retrospective gated acquisition CTA study with adequate image quality covering the entire left ventricle. CTA-GLS analysis was performed using 2D CT-Cardiac Performance Analysis prototype software (TomTec GmbH). Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were performed to evaluate the association of baseline CTA-GLS with all-cause mortality and a composite outcome of all-cause death and hospitalization for heart failure after TAVR. RESULTS: A total of 223 patients were included (mean age 83.5 ± 6.8 years, 45.7% female, mean CTA-LVEF 50.7 ± 14.5%). During a median follow-up of 32 months, 81 all-cause deaths and 134 composite outcomes occurred. When compared to patients with normal LVEF (≥50%) and preserved CTA-GLS (≤-20.5%), patients with normal LVEF but reduced CTA-GLS (>-20.5%) had higher all-cause mortality (Chi-square 6.89, p = 0.032) and the risk of composite outcome (Chi-square 7.80, p = 0.020) which was no different than those with impaired LVEF. Reduced CTA-GLS was independently associated with all-cause mortality (HR 1.71, 95% CI 1.01-2.90, p = 0.049) and the risk of composite outcome (HR 1.51, 95% CI 1.01-2.25, p = 0.044) on multivariable Cox regression analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Reduced CTA-GLS provides independent prognostic value above multiple clinical and echocardiographic characteristics.  
Selective Antegrade Cerebral Perfusion With or Without Additional Lower Body Perfusion During Aortic Arch Reconstruction in Infants.  ;"BACKGROUND: Aortic arch reconstruction is often challenging, especially in infants, owing to its high postoperative complication risks. This study aimed to compare the effectiveness between selective antegrade cerebral perfusion (SACP) alone and SACP in combination with continuous lower body perfusion with descending aortic cannulation (DAC) in preserving renal function, and to determine the influence of perfusion strategy on the postoperative course of infants who underwent aortic arch reconstruction. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 121 infants who underwent aortic arch reconstruction between January 2008 and December 2018 were included in the analysis. Patients (median age: 29 days, range: 3-270 days) were divided into the following groups: those who underwent repair with SACP (SACP group, 79 patients) and those who underwent additional lower body perfusion (DAC group, 42 patients). RESULTS: Three (7.1%) and nine (11.4%) patients died in the DAC and SACP groups, respectively (P = .54). The SACP group had more patients requiring renal replacement therapy (P = .002) and higher incidence of second stage acute kidney injury (AKI) development (Kidney disease improving global outcomes (KDIGO) criteria; P = .032). The SACP group had higher frequency of open chest postoperatively than the DAC group (P = .011). The DAC group had lower vasoactive inotropic score (VIS) at the first postoperative day (P < .001) and shorter intensive care unit length of stay (P = .050). There was no difference in neurological complications between the groups (P = .061). High VIS was associated with early mortality (odds ratio [OR]: 1.79 [1.33-2.41], P < .001) and AKI (OR: 1.60 [1.35-1.91], P < .001). The DAC perfusion strategy with minimal hypothermia was associated with lower risk of AKI (OR: 0.91 [0.84-0.98], P = .016). CONCLUSION: Antegrade cerebral perfusion with continuous lower body perfusion via DAC could effectively be used for improving early postoperative results among infants undergoing procedures that include aortic arch reconstruction.

Diepoxy- Versus Glutaraldehyde-Treated Xenografts: Outcomes of Right Ventricular Outflow Tract Reconstruction in Children.  ;"BACKGROUND: Xenografts used for right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) reconstruction are typically treated with glutaraldehyde. However, potential benefit of epoxy treatment was demonstrated in experimental studies. We aimed to compare diepoxy-treated bovine pericardial valved conduits (DE-PVCs) and glutaraldehyde-treated bovine pericardial valved conduits (GA-PVCs) for RVOT reconstruction in pediatric patients. METHODS: Between 2002 and 2017, 117 patients underwent RVOT reconstruction with PVC in single center: DE-PVC group, n = 39; and GA-PVC group, n = 78. After performing propensity score analysis (1:1) for the entire sample, 29 patients from the DE-PVC group were matched with 29 patients from the GA-PVC group. RESULTS: There were no conduit-related deaths. In the DE-PVC group, the freedom from conduit failure was 90.9% at four years and 54.3% at eight years postoperatively. In the GA-PVC group, it was 46.3% and 33.1%, respectively. The difference was significant (P = .037). Conduit failure was typically caused by stenosis in both groups. In the DE-PVC group, the main cause of stenosis was xenograft calcification (27.6%); while in the GA-PVC group, it was mostly due to neointimal proliferation (25.0%) and, less often, calcification (14.3%). Conduit thrombosis was the cause of replacement in 6.9% of patients from the GA-PVC group. CONCLUSIONS: Diepoxy-treated bovine pericardial valved conduit is a suitable alternative to GA-PVC for RVOT reconstruction in pediatric patients. Diepoxy-treated bovine pericardial valved conduits may be less prone to conduit failure and more resistant to neointimal proliferation and conduit thrombosis than GA-PVCs.  "
Aorto-Mitral Patch Enlargement for Elective Substantial Double Valve Upsizing.  ;Reconstruction of the intervalvular fibrosa is normally associated with endocarditis and the surgical principles are well established. Here, we describe how these principles are further extended and applied for the elective enlargement of the aorto-mitral continuity. Our aim was to achieve double valve upsizing in noninfective conditions. The first patient had rheumatic fever and a first double valve replacement as an adult. Her two tissue valves were later upsized at the time of replacement with mechanical prostheses. The concept was then used to perform a substantial annular enlargement in another adult patient whose original double valve replacement was done in childhood, when she received aortic and mitral prostheses measuring 17 and 23 mm, respectively. After upsizing with the technique described, her new valves were 25 and 29 mm in diameter.

Valve sparing root replacement: an update.  ;"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Until the year 2000, the publications concerning aortic valve sparing (AVS) did not exceed 20 articles; in the following years almost 300 publications have appeared. Over 35 years from the introduction of valve sparing techniques and 500 years after the death of Leonardo da Vinci, this review highlights the significant steps in modern imaging techniques and the excellent clinical results in the field of reconstructive aortic root surgery. RECENT FINDINGS: AVS operations underwent significant modifications over the last few years making it reproducible with satisfactory outcomes. The extraordinary potential of imaging opens new boundless horizons in the perspective of an increasingly patient-tailored surgical planning. The basic surgical concepts include the preservation and resuspension of the aortic valve in a near-normal environment (with the creation of functionally suited neo-aortic sinuses) and the re-establishment of a normal relationship of the aortic root components. SUMMARY: Today is possible to perform a reimplantation procedure with the creation of neo-sinuses or a remodeling procedure with the addition of annular support. Both procedures can now guarantee an anatomical root reconstruction and an increased long-term durability. AVS operations have become established alternatives to Bentall procedures for patients with aortic root pathology, especially in young patients.  "
Is there a problem with respect? Risk of neochordal rupture.  ;"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In this review, we summarize the history of mitral valve repair, discuss the broad principles of neochord preparation and implantation, and highlight comparative outcomes between mitral valve repair strategies while focusing on the risk of neochordal rupture. RECENT FINDINGS: There have been several recent studies comparing outcomes been leaflet-resection and nonresection, neochord-based mitral valve repair. Operative mortality was very low regardless of repair strategy; however, the rate of mitral valve reoperation is lower in those that undergo a neochord-based repair with overall lower mean mitral gradients postrepair. The introduction of minimally invasive approaches to mitral valve repair has preferentially favored an increase in neochord-based repair, given the technical simplicity compared with resection-based approaches. In very rare cases, neochord rupture can occur, likely secondary to a combination of chordal calcification and mechanical stress. SUMMARY: The method of performing mitral valve repair with neochord implantation has demonstrated superior durability over leaflet resection approaches with equivalent operative outcomes. Although the risk of neochord rupture exists, it is exceedingly rare, and should not be considered a limitation to a neochord-based mitral valve repair. Recurrent mitral regurgitation secondary to neochord rupture is incredibly rare; however, regular echocardiographic evaluation of these patients appears warranted, especially when follow-up extends over 10 years.

Diagnosis and management of low-flow, low-gradient aortic stenosis.  ;PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The severity of low-flow, low-gradient aortic stenosis cases continue to be misunderstood because of challenging diagnosis, and treatment remains complex. We discuss current diagnostic and treatment modalities for low-flow, low-gradient aortic stenosis. RECENT FINDINGS: This article summarizes current guidelines and best practices for the management of low-flow, low-gradient aortic stenosis. SUMMARY: Low-flow, low-gradient aortic stenosis is a difficult entity to diagnose and treat. Various diagnostic modalities are needed to accurately determine the severity of aortic stenosis and potential treatment benefit. True-severe classical and paradoxical low-flow, low-gradient aortic stenosis can be distinguished from pseudo-severe aortic stenosis by dobutamine stress echocardiography and/or multidetector computed tomography. Once the distinction is made, aortic valve replacement results in better outcomes compared with conservative management. Although both surgical and transcatheter aortic valve replacement result in adequate outcomes, the decision between the two treatment strategies is based on patient characteristics, valve morphology, and other risk factors.  
Changes in left ventricular function and contractile homogeneity in young adults with newly diagnosed hyperthyroidism due to Graves' disease.  ;PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate myocardial dysfunction and mechanical abnormalities in young patients with Graves' disease before therapy, using two-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography. METHODS: We performed a comprehensive transthoracic echocardiographic examination, including segmental and global radial strain, and time-to-peak radial strain, in 47 young patients with hyperthyroidism and 34 healthy adults. The time-to-peak radial strain was corrected by RR interval. The variables derived from radial myocardial deformation by the six-basal, six-mid, and six-apical segmental model were compared to investigate the difference of the myocardial function between the two groups. RESULTS: Early diastolic mitral inflow velocity, E/A ratio, early diastolic mitral annular velocity, and e'/a' ratio were lower in patients with Graves' disease than in controls. The left ventricular end-diastolic volume, left ventricular end-systolic volume, stroke volume, cardiac output, heart rate, late diastolic mitral inflow velocity, and late diastolic mitral annular velocity were slightly higher in patients than in controls. Radial strain, global radial strain, and corrected time-to-peak radial strain were lower in the patient group. CONCLUSIONS: The decreased radial strain, global radial strain, and corrected time-to-peak radial strain in young patients with newly diagnosed hyperthyroidism due to Graves' disease could serve as an early sign of subclinical cardiac involvement.  
Comparison of Survival of Transfemoral Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation Versus Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement for Aortic Stenosis in Low-Risk Patients Without Coronary Artery Disease.  ;Increasing data support transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) as a valid option over surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in the treatment for severe aortic stenosis (AS) also in patients with low operative risk. However, limited data exist on the outcome of TAVI and SAVR in low-risk patients without coronary artery disease (CAD). The FinnValve registry included data on 6463 patients who underwent TAVI or SAVR with bioprosthesis between 2008 and 2017. Herein, we evaluated the outcome of low operative risk as defined by STS-PROM score <3% and absence of CAD, previous stroke and other relevant co-morbidities. Only patients who underwent TAVI with third-generation prostheses and SAVR with Perimount Magna Ease or Trifecta prostheses were included in this analysis. The primary endpoints were 30-day and 3-year all-cause mortality. Overall, 1,006 patients (175 TAVI patients and 831 SAVR patients) met the inclusion criteria of this analysis. Propensity score matching resulted in 140 pairs with similar baseline characteristics. Among these matched pairs, 30-day mortality was 2.1% in both TAVI and SAVR cohorts (p = 1.00) and 3-year mortality was 17.0% after TAVI and 14.6% after SAVR (p = 0.805). Lower rates of bleeding and atrial fibrillation, and shorter hospital stay were observed after TAVI. The need of new permanent pacemaker implantation and the incidence of early stroke did not differ between groups. In conclusion, TAVI using third-generation prostheses achieved similar early and mid-term survival compared with SAVR in low-risk patients without CAD.  
Low doses of BPA induced abnormal mitochondrial fission and hypertrophy in human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes via the calcineurin-DRP1 signaling pathway: A comparison between XX and XY cardiomyocytes.  ;Humans are inevitably exposed to bisphenol A (BPA) via multiple exposure ways. Thus, attention should be raised to the possible adverse effects related to low doses of BPA. Epidemiological studies have outlined BPA exposure and the increased risk of cardiovascular diseases (such as cardiac hypertrophy), which has been confirmed to be sex-specific in rodent animals and present in few in vitro studies, although the molecular mechanism is still unclear. However, whether BPA at low doses equivalent to human internal exposure level could induce cardiac hypertrophy via the calcineurin-DRP1 signaling pathway by disrupting calcium homeostasis is unknown. To address this, human embryonic stem cell (H1, XY karyotype and H9, XX karyotype)-derived cardiomyocytes (CM) were purified and applied to study the low-dose effects of BPA on cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. In our study, when H1- and H9-CM were exposed to noncytotoxic BPA (8 ng/ml), markedly elevated hypertrophic-related mRNA expression levels (such as NPPA and NPPB), enhanced cellular area and reduced ATP supplementation, demonstrated the hypertrophic cardiomyocyte phenotype in vitro. The excessive fission produced by BPA was promoted by CnAβ-mediated dephosphorylation of DRP1. At the molecular level, the increase in cytosolic Ca2+ levels by low doses of BPA could discriminate between H1- and H9-CM, which may suggest a potential sex-specific hypertrophic risk in cardiomyocytes in terms of abnormal mitochondrial fission and ATP production by impairing CnAβ-DRP1 signaling. In CnAβ-knockdown cardiomyocytes, these changes were highly presented in XX-karyotyped cells, rather than in XY-karyotyped cells.

Stroke after transcatheter edge-to-edge mitral valve repair: a systematic review and meta-analysis.  ;AIMS: The aim of this study was to assess the stroke rate after transcatheter mitral valve repair (TMVR) with the MitraClip, comparing it with surgical mitral valve repair (SMVR) and optimal medical treatment (OMT). METHODS AND RESULTS: In December 2018, we systematically searched PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Controlled Register of Trials for studies comparing TMVR with SMVR and/or OMT for the treatment of severe mitral regurgitation. Random-effects and cumulative meta-analysis was performed. Ten studies were included (seven of TMVR versus SMVR and three of TMVR versus OMT), providing a total of 1,881 patients and 61 pooled strokes (16 in TMVR versus SMVR and 45 in TMVR versus OMT). There was no difference in stroke incidence between TMVR and SMVR (pooled OR 0.49 [0.17, 1.42], p=0.19). However, there was a trend towards a lower stroke risk in TMVR. For TMVR versus OMT, no difference in stroke rate was identified (pooled OR 1.09 [0.60, 1.97], p=0.79). Post-procedure de novo atrial fibrillation was more frequent in SMVR when compared with TMVR. CONCLUSIONS: Despite both a low number of pooled stroke events and the failure to reach the pre-specified statistical significance, there was a trend for a lower post-procedure stroke rate in TMVR when compared with SMVR and a similar one between TMVR and OMT alone.  
Scientists on the Spot: Putting a halt to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  ;DOI: 10.1093/cvr/cvz296 PMID: 31828295 [Indexed for MEDLINE]  
Cardiovascular magnetic resonance: applications and practical considerations for the general cardiologist.  ;Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is a rapidly evolving non-invasive imaging modality offering comprehensive, multiparametric assessment of cardiac structure and function in a variety of clinical situations. Cine imaging with CMR is the gold standard non-invasive imaging technique for the quantification of ventricular volumes and systolic function. It also affords superior visualisation of apical and right ventricular morphological abnormalities. In coronary artery disease, CMR stress perfusion imaging identifies functionally significant coronary artery disease with high sensitivity and specificity, and international guidelines recommend CMR perfusion imaging in patients with chest pain at intermediate-high risk of coronary disease. Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) imaging is the most sensitive imaging technique for identifying infarction/viability. In non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy, LGE imaging plays vital diagnostic and prognostic roles in a number of cardiomyopathies (eg, hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathies, and amyloidosis). In vivo tissue characterisation with CMR enables the identification of oedema/inflammation in acute coronary syndromes/myocarditis and the diagnosis of chronic fibrotic conditions (eg, in hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathy, aortic stenosis and amyloidosis). CMR T2* imaging uniquely offers non-invasive assessment of iron overload states, facilitating diagnosis and management. A multiparametric CMR approach also enables differentiation of cardiac masses/tumours and is a useful adjunct to echocardiography in the assessment of valve disease. The emergence of automated, inline, quantitative methodologies will expand the scope of CMR and reduce its cost in forthcoming years.  
External Performance of the HAVOC Score for the Prediction of New Incident Atrial Fibrillation.  ;"Background and Purpose- The HAVOC score (hypertension, age, valvular heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, obesity, congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease) was proposed for the prediction of atrial fibrillation (AF) after cryptogenic stroke. It showed good model discrimination (area under the curve, 0.77). Only 2.5% of patients with a low-risk HAVOC score (ie, 0-4) were diagnosed with new incident AF. We aimed to assess its performance in an external cohort of patients with embolic stroke of undetermined source. Methods- In the AF-embolic stroke of undetermined source dataset, we assessed the discriminatory power, calibration, specificity, negative predictive value, and accuracy of the HAVOC score to predict new incident AF. Patients with a HAVOC score of 0 to 4 were considered as low-risk, as proposed in its original publication. Results- In 658 embolic stroke of undetermined source patients (median age, 67 years; 44% women), the median HAVOC score was 2 (interquartile range, 3). There were 540 (82%) patients with a HAVOC score of 0 to 4 and 118 (18%) with a score of ≥5. New incident AF was diagnosed in 95 (14.4%) patients (28.8% among patients with HAVOC score ≥5 and 11.3% among patients with HAVOC score 0-4 [age- and sex-adjusted odds ratio, 2.29 (95% CI, 1.37-3.82)]). The specificity of low-risk HAVOC score to identify patients without new incident AF was 88.7%. The negative predictive value of low-risk HAVOC score was 85.1%. The accuracy was 78.0%, and the area under the curve was 68.7% (95% CI, 62.1%-73.3%). Conclusions- The previously reported low rate of AF among embolic stroke of undetermined source patients with low-risk HAVOC score was not confirmed in our cohort. Further assessment of the HAVOC score is warranted before it is routinely implemented in clinical practice.  "

A systematic review of the cost-effectiveness of heart valve replacement with a mechanical versus biological prosthesis in patients with heart valvular disease.  ;Heart valve disease (HVD) affects 2.5% of the US population and one million individuals aged 65 years and older in the UK. Given its burden, the aim of the present review was to assess the cost-effectiveness of heart valve replacement with mechanical versus biological prosthesis in HVD patients. We performed a systematic search in various electronic databases from January 1990 to June 2019. Five out of 542 articles were entered into the study, from which 2 papers were subsequently excluded not meeting the minimum number of items of the CHEERS checklist. Quality-Adjusted Life Year, Life Years Gained, and the Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) regarding the type of replaced heart valve were extracted and reported. Studies were conducted in three different countries (Iran, France, and USA). ICER ranged from $1253 in Iran to €54,634 in France. Survival rate of mitral mechanical versus biological valves at 10 and 20 years was 72.9% versus 76.0% and 51% versus 30%, respectively. Survival rate at 20 years in patients undergoing atrial valve replacement was 20%. Ten- and 20-year death rates for biological valves were higher with respect to mechanical prosthesis (15.5% versus 8.4% at 10 years), with this difference becoming more relevant at 20 years (36.9% versus 13.9%). Due to higher ICER, mortality rate, and lower success rates in the long term for biological prostheses compared to mechanical ones, these appear to be more suitable for older patients (aged ≥ 70 years).  
Best Practices of Aortic Valve Replacement With the Edwards Intuity Elite Valve.  ;"PURPOSE: The Edwards Intuity Elite (EIE; Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA) valve system is a recent surgical aortic valve designed to expedite implantation, facilitate minimally invasive approaches, and provide low gradients, particularly in smaller valve sizes. The report reviews various best practices learned through experience with the EIE valve system. DESCRIPTION: With its sealing frame designed to anchor and seal the valve after resection of the diseased native aortic valve, EIE use differs from that of conventional sutured valves. EVALUATION: Critical technical aspects include patient selection, aortotomy and debridement, valve sizing, guiding suture technique and valve seating and deployment. In addition, special anatomic and pathologic conditions are considered, as well as intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography and postimplantation cardiac rhythm monitoring. CONCLUSIONS: These best practices simplify and standardize the use of the EIE valve system and may benefit surgeons adopting this valve.  "
Outcomes of mitral valve surgery for severe ischemic mitral regurgitation.  ;"BACKGROUND: This study evaluated outcomes of mitral valve surgery for severe ischemic mitral regurgitation (IMR). METHODS: Patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with concomitant mitral valve repair (MVr) or replacement (MVR) for severe IMR at a single center between 2010 and 2017 were included. The primary outcome was 5-year survival. Secondary outcomes included operative mortality and morbidity, hospital readmission, recurrence of at least moderate mitral regurgitation (MR), and mitral valve reoperation. RESULTS: A total of 358 patients underwent concomitant mitral valve surgery with CABG for severe IMR (275 MVr and 83 MVR). Unadjusted and risk-adjusted operative mortality was higher in MVR (16% vs 8%; P = .04). MVR patients had higher rates of postoperative renal failure, prolonged ventilation, and deep sternal wound infection. The unadjusted 5-year survival was similar (MVR 64% vs MVr 64%; P = .41), a finding that persisted after risk-adjustment. The 5-year freedom from mitral valve reoperation was 96% and 97% (P = .47). Freedom from at least moderate MR at 1-year and 3-years was 100% vs 86% (P = .09) and 100% vs 68% (P = .06) for MVR and MVr, respectively. However, only three MVr patients developed severe MR by 3 years. Cumulative hazards for all-cause readmission and heart failure-specific readmission were higher with MVR. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a trend towards higher risk of MR recurrence, patients undergoing MVr have similar rates of survival and mitral valve reoperation, with lower rates of readmission at 5-years. This, combined with lower operative mortality rates, makes MVr a reasonable choice particularly in sicker patients with higher operative risk and more limited life expectancy.  "
Re: Relation between Mitral Valve Prolapse and Erectile Dysfunction (from a Nationwide Case-Control Study).  ;DOI: 10.1097/JU.0000000000000668 PMID: 31821082 [Indexed for MEDLINE]  
Assessment of mitral valve regurgitation by cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging.  ;Mitral regurgitation (MR) is a common valvular heart disease and is the second most frequent indication for heart valve surgery in Western countries. Echocardiography is the recommended first-line test for the assessment of valvular heart disease, but cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) provides complementary information, especially for assessing MR severity and to plan the timing of intervention. As new CMR techniques for the assessment of MR have arisen, standardizing CMR protocols for research and clinical studies has become important in order to optimize diagnostic utility and support the wider use of CMR for the clinical assessment of MR. In this Consensus Statement, we provide a detailed description of the current evidence on the use of CMR for MR assessment, highlight its current clinical utility, and recommend a standardized CMR protocol and report for MR assessment.  
"""Crab-like"" mitral valve endocarditis.  ";DOI: 10.1111/jocs.14368 PMID: 31816121 [Indexed for MEDLINE]  
An unexpected association in a patient with heart failure presenting a surgical challenge.  ;Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is the most common form of congenital heart disease and frequently leads to premature valvular dysfunction. BAV is associated with aortic wall abnormalities and a high prevalence of ascending aorta dilatation and coarctation of the aorta (CoA). Consequently, in patients with BAV a careful assessment of the valve, and also of the aortic root and the ascending aorta, should be performed. The most feared complication is aortic dissection, however, the actual incidence of this complication is low. We report the case of a 58-year-old man who presented with New York Heart Association class III heart failure. The work-up revealed BAV with severe stenosis and severe compromise of left ventricle systolic function. In addition, CoA in the isthmus region, and type B dissection of the aorta were diagnosed.  
Worldwide and European interest in the MitraClip: a Google Trends-based analysis.  ;AIMS: The use of MitraClip (Abbott Vascular, Santa Clara, California, USA) for the treatment of severe functional mitral valve regurgitation (FMR) has drastically increased over recent years. We analysed the Worldwide and European interest on the MitraClip among Internet users performing a Google Trends-based analysis. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis extracting the data from the cited Google Trends (https://trends.google.com) to explore both the worldwide and European interest in the MitraClip over recent years. Specifically, Google Trends was queried from 1 January 2008 to 31 September 2019 using the item 'MitraClip'. RESULTS: Over the study period, the worldwide interest in the MitraClip steadily increased by 47.7% per month (Ptrend < 0.001). The analysis performed among the 11 European countries in which the search volume allowed a trend to be created over the study period confirming an increasing significant interest. Specifically, the higher rate of interest increase per month was registered in France followed by Poland, Spain and Italy (40.5, 35.9, 37.3 and 31.8%, respectively). CONCLUSION: A growing interest in the MitraClip exists both in Europe and worldwide.  
Global and regional myocardial function and outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve implantation for aortic stenosis and preserved ejection fraction.  ;"AIM: To investigate the effects of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) on early recovery of global and segmental myocardial function in patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis and preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and to determine if parameters of deformation correlate with outcomes. METHODS: The echocardiographic (strain analysis) and outcome (hospitalizations because of heart failure and mortality) data of 62 consecutive patients with preserved LVEF (64.54 ± 7.97%) who underwent CoreValve prosthesis implantation were examined. RESULTS: Early after TAVI (5 ± 3.9 days), no significant changes in LVEF or diastolic function were found, while a significant drop of systolic pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) occurred (42.3 ± 14.9 vs. 38.1 ± 13.9 mmHg, P = 0.028). After TAVI global longitudinal strain (GLS) did not change significantly, whereas significant improvement in global mid-level left ventricular (LV) radial strain (GRS) was found (-16.71 ± 2.42 vs. -17.32 ± 3.25%; P = 0.33; 16.57 ± 6.6 vs. 19.48 ± 5.97%, P = 0.018, respectively). Early significant recovery of longitudinal strain was found in basal lateral and anteroseptal segments (P = 0.038 and 0.048). Regional radial strain at the level of papillary muscles [P = 0.038 mid-lateral, P < 0.001 mid-anteroseptum (RSAS)] also improved. There was a significant LV mass index reduction in the late follow-up (152.42 ± 53.21 vs. 136.24 ± 56.67 g/m, P = 0.04). Mean follow-up period was 3.5 ± 1.9 years. Parameters associated with worse outcomes in univariable analysis were RSAS pre-TAVI, LV end-diastolic diameter after TAVI, relative wall thickness, and mitral E and E/A after TAVI. CONCLUSION: Global and regional indices of myocardial function improved early after TAVI, suggesting the potential of myocardium to recover with a reduced risk for clinical deterioration.  "
Mid-term single-center outcomes of BioIntegral compared to Freestyle aortic conduit implantation.  ;BACKGROUND: Full aortic root replacement with biological conduit has limited options. This non-randomized cohort study aims to compare mid-term clinical and hemodynamic results of the BioIntegral (BI) composite biological versus the stentless Freestyle (FS) conduits in patients undergoing full aortic root replacement. METHODS: From February 2013 to July 2017, 265 patients underwent aortic root replacement at a single institution (202 BI, 65 FS). Preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative parameters, complications including stroke, myocardial infarction (MI), endocarditis and reoperation were studied. Hemodynamic performance of both conduits was analyzed by echocardiography. Target endpoints were 30-day mortality, two-year survival, two-year freedom from major adverse valve-related and cardiovascular events. RESULTS: Wider BI conduits were used (BI 27±2 vs. FS 25±2 mm, P<0.0001). The BI group had shorter cardiopulmonary bypass (BI 165±67 vs. FS 200±78 min, P<0.0001) and cross-clamp (BI 102±36 vs. FS 122±40 min, P=0.001) times. Thirty-day mortality was similar in both groups. There were fewer conduit-related reoperations in the BI group (BI 0% vs. FS 3%, P=0.012) but higher postoperative atrial fibrillation (BI 31% vs. FS 17%, P=0.025). No significant differences were observed for stroke (BI 5% vs. FS 10%, P=0.947), MI (BI 3% vs. FS 4%, P=0.583), or infective endocarditis (BI 0% vs. FS 2%, P=0.077). No significant hemodynamic differences were evident on follow-up echocardiography while an improved overall survival trend was seen in the BI group (P=0.062). CONCLUSIONS: FS and BI provide comparable clinical mid-term results and hemodynamic parameters. Simplified implantation technique providing shorter cardiopulmonary bypass and operation times are advantageous for BI.  
Vascular access site complications after transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation in the POL-TAVI Registry: surgical versus percutaneous approach.  ;BACKGROUND: Transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TF TAVI) has recently become an established treatment option for intermediate and high-risk surgical patients with severe aortic stenosis. Despite significant reduction in diameter of valvular delivery systems, access related vascular complications remain a major safety concern. The aim of this study was to evaluate impact of femoral access techniques: surgical versus percutaneous on in-hospital outcomes. METHODS: Polish National TAVI Registry (POL-TAVI) was used as a data source. The analysis included 1680 patients treated with TF TAVI in years 2013-2016. 677 patients were treated using percutaneous technique (Group PC) and 1003 using open surgical access (Group S). The two groups were matched and compared. All-cause mortality, length of hospital stay, procedure time and potential risk factors for vascular access site complications after TF TAVI were analyzed. RESULTS: Vascular access site complications were reported in 162 (9.64%) of 1680 patients and were found significantly more often in PC group (13.15% vs. 7.28% P>0.001). There was a significant difference between groups regarding Body Mass Index, arterial hypertension, transient ischemic attack history and NYHA classification. The data analysis showed that increased probability of all vascular complications was associated with percutaneous access. In addition, left-side access and female sex were independent risk factors for all vascular complications. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical cut-down in the groin with exposure of the artery and manual suture after the procedure seems to be a safer option for TF TAVI patients.  
"""Incompatible Housemates"": Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy and Takotsubo Syndrome.  ";This case report concerns an 81-year-old woman with previously well-controlled hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). She was referred to our hospital because of the acute onset of takotsubo syndrome. Echocardiography revealed basal hyperkinesis due to takotsubo syndrome superimposed on septal hypertrophy, which resulted in the reappearance of prominent left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO). Although she developed cardiogenic shock triggered by atrial fibrillation, LVOTO was successfully mitigated by aggressive fluid resuscitation, rhythm control, and the administration of β-blocker. We herein report a rare case with catastrophic hemodynamics due to the incidental combination of HOCM and takotsubo syndrome.  
A Challenging Case of MitraClip on a Tricuspid Valve With a Redundant Eustachian Valve: Surfing Into the Right Atrium.  ;Transcatheter tricuspid valve intervention is gaining importance due to the development of percutaneous techniques addressing tricuspid regurgitation. The presence of a redundant eustachian valve can increase procedural complexity by restricting the manipulation of transcatheter devices. We present a case of torrential tricuspid regurgitation and a redundant eustachian valve hampering the manipulation of the delivery system. We were able to reach the tricuspid valve by looping 2 standard guidewires into the atrium. We performed a tricuspid-plasty by implanting 2 MitraClips with a satisfactory final result. This technique can be applied when the eustachian valve impairs navigation in the right atrium.  
Edwards SAPIEN Versus Medtronic Aortic Bioprosthesis in Women Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (from the Win-TAVI Registry).  ;"We sought to analyze outcomes of women receiving balloon-expandable valves (BEV) or self-expanding valves (SEV) in contemporary transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). WIN TAVI (Women's INternational Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation) is the first all-female TAVI registry to study the safety and performance of TAVI in women. We compared women treated with BEV (n = 408, 46.9%) versus those treated with SEV (n = 461, 53.1%). The primary efficacy end point was the Valve Academic Research Consortium-2 (VARC-2) composite of 1-year all-cause death, stroke, myocardial infarction, hospitalization for valve-related symptoms or heart failure or valve-related dysfunction. Women receiving SEV had higher surgical risk scores, higher rate of previous stroke and pulmonary hypertension whereas women receiving BEV were more frequently denied surgical valve replacement due to frailty. BEV patients were less likely to require post-dilation and had significantly lower rates of residual aortic regurgitation grade ≥2 (9.8% vs 4.7%, p = 0.007). At 1 year, the crude incidence and adjusted risk of the primary VARC-2 efficacy end point was similar between groups (17.1% with SEV and 14.3% with BEV, p = 0.25; hazards ratio 1.09, 95% confidence interval 0.68 to 1.75). Conversely the crude rate and adjusted risk of new pacemaker implantation was higher with SEV than BEV (15% vs 8.6%, p = 0.001; hazards ratio 1.97, 95% confidence interval 1.13 to 3.43). A subanalysis on new generation valves showed no difference in the need for pacemaker implantation between the 2 devices (10.1% vs 8.0%, p = 0.56). In conclusion, in contemporary TAVI, SEV are used more frequently in women with greater co-morbidities. While there were no differences in unadjusted and adjusted risk of 1-year primary efficacy end point between the valve types, there was a greater need for permanent pacemakers after SEV implantation.

Feature tracking computed tomography-derived left ventricular global longitudinal strain in patients with aortic stenosis: a comparative analysis with echocardiographic measurements.  ;BACKGROUND: Left ventricular (LV) systolic function is a prognostic factor in patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS). Multi-detector row computed tomography (MDCT) data are key in the evaluation of patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) and when acquired retrospectively, LV systolic function can be assessed. Novel software permits assessment of LV global longitudinal strain (GLS) from MDCT data. OBJECTIVES: The present study investigated the feasibility of feature tracking MDCT-derived LV GLS and its agreement with echocardiographic LV GLS in patients treated with TAVI. METHODS: LV GLS was measured on transthoracic echocardiography using speckle tracking analysis and on dynamic MDCT using feature tracking technology. Agreement between the measurements of two different modalities was assessed using Bland-Altman analysis. RESULTS: A total of 214 patients (51% male, mean age: 80 ± 7 years) were analysed. Mean LV GLS on echocardiography was -13.91 ± 4.32%, whereas mean feature tracking MDCT-derived GLS was -12.46 ± 3.97%. Correlation of measurements between feature tracking MDCT-derived LV GLS and echocardiographic LV GLS demonstrated a large effect size (r = 0.791, p < 0.001). On Bland-Altman analysis, feature tracking MDCT-derived strain analysis underestimated LV GLS compared to echocardiography with a mean difference of 1.44% (95% limits of agreement -3.85% - 6.73%). CONCLUSIONS: Assessment of LV GLS on dynamic feature tracking MDCT data is feasible in TAVI patients. Compared to speckle tracking echocardiography, feature tracking MDCT underestimates the value of LV GLS.  
Predictive role of ventricular repolarization parameters for the occurrence of complete heart block in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation.  ;"BACKGROUND: We investigated the role of ventricular repolarization parameters to predict complete atrioventricular block in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). METHODS: A total of 150 patients undergoing TAVI due to severe aortic stenosis were included in this retrospective cohort study. Patients were assigned in two groups based on the presence (n: 49) or absence (n: 101) of complete atrioventricular block after TAVI. Ventricular repolarization intervals (QT, QTc, JT, JTc, TP-E), indices (QT dispersion), and ratios (TP-E/QT, TP-E/QTc, TP-E/JTc) were measured. RESULTS: Electrocardiographic repolarization parameters such as Tp-e interval: 74.2 ± 5.1 versus 59.2 ± 6.1 ms, p < .001; QTc interval: 397.6 ± 3.4 versus 368.1 ± 7.8 ms, p < .001; JTc interval: 317.4 ± 11.3 versus 291.1 ± 6.7 ms, p < .001; Tp-e/QT ratio: 0.28 ± 0.04 versus 0.20 ± 0.04, p < .001; Tp-e/QTc ratio: 0.29 ± 0.04 versus 0.19 ± 0.03, p < .001; Tp-e/JT ratio: 0.32 ± 0.03 versus 0.23 ± 0.03, p < .001; Tp-e/JTc ratio: 0.30 ± 0.02 versus 0.2 ± 0.03, p < .001; and QT dispersion: 34.4 ± 3.0 versus 17.8 ± 3.6 ms, p < .01 were significantly higher in post-TAVI permanent pacemaker group. In a univariate regression analysis, pulmonary artery pressure, heart rate, coronary artery disease, Tp-e/QTc, Tp-e/JTc, and PR interval were significantly associated with complete heart block. Tp-e/JTc (OR 0.373, p = .067) and PR interval (OR 0.898, p = .079) were found to be independent predictors of these type of arrhythmias in a multivariate analysis. But it is not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that repolarization parameters may play a role in predicting complete atrioventricular block. Tp-e/JTc was found to be potential independent risk marker for this setting.  "
Importance of Flow in Risk Stratification of Aortic Stenosis.  ;"Comment on Can J Cardiol. 2020 Jan;36(1):112-118.  "
Immediate and long-term need for permanent cardiac pacing following aortic valve replacement.  ;"Introduction: Atrioventricular (AV) node conduction disturbances are common following surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR), and in some cases the patient needs a permanent pacemaker (PPM) implantation before discharge from hospital. Little is known about the long-term need for PPM and the PPM dependency of these individuals. We determined the incidence of PPM implantation before and after discharge in SAVR patients. Methods: We studied 557 consecutive patients who underwent SAVR for aortic stenosis in Iceland between 2002 and 2016. Timing and indication for PPM were registered, with a new concept, ventricular pacing proportion (VPP), defined as ventricular pacing ≥90% of the time, being used to approximate pacemaker dependency. The median follow-up time was 73 months. We plotted the cumulative incidence of pacemaker implantation, treating death as a competing risk. Results: Of the 557 patients, 22 (3.9%) received PPM in the first 30 days after surgery, most commonly for complete AV block (n = 14) or symptomatic bradycardia (n = 8); Thirty-eight other patients (6.8%) had a PPM implanted >30 days postoperatively, at a median of 43 months after surgery (range 0‒181), most often for AV block (n = 13) or sick-sinus syndrome (n = 10). The cumulative incidence of PPM implantation at 1, 5, and 10 years postoperatively was 5.0%, 9.2%, and 12.3%, respectively. During follow-up, 45.0% of the 60 patients had VPP ≥90%. Conclusion: The cumulative incidence of permanent pacemaker implantation following SAVR was about 12% at 10 years, with every other patient having VPP ≥90% during follow-up. This suggests that AV node conduction disturbances extend significantly beyond the perioperative period.  "
Identification of cardiac organ damage in arterial hypertension: insights by echocardiography for a comprehensive assessment.  ;: Arterial hypertension, a widespread disease, whose prevalence increases with age, represents a major risk factor for cardiovascular events, causing damage in several organs, including the heart. In this context, echocardiography has a clear and pivotal role, being able to assess cardiac morphology and detect haemodynamic changes induced by this disease. 2018 European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension guidelines on AH identified main echo parameters such as left ventricular mass, relative wall thickness and left atrial volume, for detecting cardiac organ damage. The present review highlights the advantage of additional echocardiographic parameters such as diastolic measurement and both thoracic and abdominal aortic dimensions. An overlook on aortic valve should also be suggested to detect aortic regurgitation and stenosis, both frequent complications in hypertensive patients. In this kind of comprehensive assessment, the combination of standard and advanced echocardiography (speckle tracking echocardiography and, with a lesser extent, three-dimensional echocardiography) could be considered to improve the diagnostic accuracy, stratify prognosis and address management in arterial hypertension.  
Prognostic value of mitral valve tenting area in patients with functional mitral regurgitation.  ;"OBJECTIVES: Mitral valve (MV) repair in functional mitral regurgitation is still associated with suboptimal outcomes. Our goal was to determine whether the clinical outcome following MV repair correlates with preoperative tenting parameters. METHODS: We retrospectively identified consecutive patients with functional mitral regurgitation who underwent an isolated MV annuloplasty during a 7-year period (2010-2016) from our institutional database. Preoperative tenting parameters (i.e. tenting height, coaptation length, tenting area, posterior mitral leaflet and anterior mitral leaflet angles and interpapillary muscle distance) were systematically measured. The primary end point was the composite of survival and freedom from adverse cardiac events. The follow-up protocol consisted of a structured clinical questionnaire and an analysis of the echocardiographic data. RESULTS: A total of 240 patients (mean age 67.8 ± 9.8 years, 57% of men) were analysed. The overall 5-year survival rate for the whole study cohort was 74.7 ± 4.2%, and freedom from adverse cardiac events was 84.8 ± 3.4%. A tenting area ≥2.4 cm2 was identified as a cut-off value, independently predicting the composite primary study end point (hazard ratio 2.0; P = 0.03). Furthermore, a Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a strong tendency towards worse 5-year outcomes in patients with a tenting area ≥2.4 cm2 (n = 153) versus patients with a tenting area <2.4 cm2 (n = 87) (65.3 ± 5.5% vs 77.1 ± 6.3%; P = 0.06). CONCLUSIONS: MV annuloplasty is associated with acceptable clinical and echocardiographic outcomes in patients with functional mitral regurgitation 5 years postoperatively. A preoperative tenting area ≥2.4 cm2 showed a strong trend towards a worse 5-year survival rate and an increased risk of adverse cardiac events after an isolated MV annuloplasty.  "
Clinical outcomes after TAVR with heparin or bivalirudin as periprocedural anticoagulation in patients with and without peripheral arterial disease: Results from the BRAVO-3 randomized trial.  ;"OBJECTIVES: This study sought to investigate the clinical outcomes of patients with and without peripheral artery disease (PAD) in the BRAVO-3 trial with respect to the effect of bivalirudin versus unfractionated heparin (UFH). BACKGROUND: PAD is found frequently in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and is reported to confer an increased risk of adverse events. It is unknown whether patients with and without PAD may demonstrate a differential response to bivalirudin versus UFH. METHODS: BRAVO-3 was a randomized multicenter trial comparing transfemoral TAVR with bivalirudin versus UFH (31 centers, n = 802). Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) were a composite of 30-day death, myocardial infarction, or cerebrovascular accidents (CVA). Net adverse cardiovascular events (NACE) were a composite of major bleeding or MACE. RESULTS: The total cohort included 119 patients with PAD. Vascular complications occurred significantly more frequently in patients with PAD both in-hospital (25.2 vs. 16.7%; OR 1.68) and at 30 days (29.4 vs. 17.3%; OR 1.99). No significant differences were observed regarding mortality, NACE, MACE, major bleeding or CVA with bivalirudin versus UFH among patients with or without PAD. In patients with PAD, bivalirudin was associated with an increased risk of minor vascular complications at 30 days. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with PAD undergoing transfemoral TAVR did not exhibit an increased risk of any major adverse events, according to the procedural anticoagulant randomization. However, patients treated with Bivalirudin had significantly higher rates of minor vascular complications.  "
Relation of Frailty to Cost for Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.  ;Frailty is associated with significant morbidity and mortality for patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). In addition to clinical outcomes, cost is an important factor to inform clinical decision-making around TAVI. However, the association of frailty with cost is unknown. This study tested whether frailty was associated with cost for adult patients who underwent TAVI at a moderate-volume single center between December 2012 and April 2018 (n = 431). Frailty was determined from pre-TAVI clinical visits as a composite of 2 markers: 5-meter walk time (abnormal: >6 seconds or unable to perform) and serum albumin (abnormal: <3.5 g/dl). Patients were excluded if missing frailty assessment or covariate data (24). Cost data were derived from financial statements, and assigned at the department-level by charge code. Multivariable regression models were adjusted for age, gender, and procedural co-morbidities. Of 407 patients in the analytical sample (mean age 81 years, 49% female), 74 (18%) were determined to be frail. Adjusted mean total costs were $6,397 higher for frail patients ($78,823 vs $72,425, p = 0.042) compared with nonfrail. Higher total costs were driven by department-level charges associated with longer in-hospital length of stay (7.6 vs 3.3 days, p <0.001): room, physical therapy, pharmacy, laboratory, supply, and imaging services. Providers must address frailty proactively to salvage the benefit associated with TAVI.  
Never Too Old for a Congenital Heart Disease: A Case of a Unileaflet Mitral Valve in a 76-year-old Man.  ;DOI: 10.4250/jcvi.2019.0077 PMCID: PMC6992916 PMID: 31805616  
Porcine Small Intestinal Submucosa Mitral Valve Material Responses Support Acute Somatic Growth.  ;Background: Conceptually, a tissue engineered heart valve would be especially appealing in the pediatric setting since small size and somatic growth constraints would be alleviated. In this study, we utilized porcine small intestinal submucosa (PSIS) for valve replacement. Of note, we evaluated the material responses of PSIS and subsequently its acute function and somatic growth potential in the mitral position. Methods and Results: Material and mechanical assessment demonstrated that both fatigued 2ply (∼65 μm) and 4ply (∼110 μm) PSIS specimens exhibited similar failure mechanisms, but at an accelerated rate in the former. Specifically, the fatigued 2ply PSIS samples underwent noticeable fiber pullout and recruitment on the bioscaffold surface, leading to higher yield strength (p < 0.05) and yield strain (p < 0.05) compared to its fatigued 4ply counterparts. Consequently, 2ply PSIS mitral valve constructs were subsequently implanted in juvenile baboons (n = 3). Valve function was longitudinally monitored for 90 days postvalve implantation and was found to be robust in all animals. Histology at 90 days in one of the animals revealed the presence of residual porcine cells, fibrin matrix, and host baboon immune cells but an absence of tissue regeneration. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the altered structural responses of PSIS, postfatigue, rather than de novo tissue formation, are primarily responsible for the valve's ability to accommodate somatic growth during the acute phase (90 days) following mitral valve replacement. Impact Statement Tissue engineered heart valves (TEHVs) offer the potential of supporting somatic growth. In this study, we investigated a porcine small intestinal submucosa bioscaffold for pediatric mitral heart valve replacement. The novelty of the study lies in identifying material responses under mechanical loading conditions and its effectiveness in being able to function as a TEHV. In addition, the ability of the scaffold valve to support acute somatic growth was evaluated in the Baboon model. The current study contributes toward finding a solution for critical valve diseases in children, whose current prognosis for survival is poor.  
The Profiles and Correlates of Psychopathology in Adolescents and Adults with Williams, Fragile X and Prader-Willi Syndromes.  ;"Psychopathology is prevalent in Williams (WS), fragile X (FXS) and Prader-Willi (PWS) syndromes. However, little is known about the potential correlates of psychopathology in these groups. A questionnaire study was completed by 111 caregivers of individuals with WS (n = 35); FXS (n = 50) and PWS (n = 26). Mean age was 26 years (range 12-57 years); 74 (67%) were male. Multiple regression analyses indicated that higher rates of health problems and sensory impairments predicted higher psychopathology in WS (p < .0001). In PWS, poorer adaptive ability predicted higher overall psychiatric disturbance (p = .001), generalised anxiety (p = .006) and hyperactivity (p = .003). There were no significant predictors in FXS. This study highlights dissociations in the potential risk markers of psychopathology between genetic syndromes. Implications for intervention are discussed.  "
Diacylglycerol Kinase ζ Regulates Macrophage Responses in Juvenile Arthritis and Cytokine Storm Syndrome Mouse Models.  ;Dysregulation of monocyte and macrophage responses are often observed in children with systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA) and cytokine storm syndrome (CSS), a potentially fatal complication of chronic rheumatic diseases. Both conditions are associated with activation of TLR signaling in monocyte and macrophage lineage cells, leading to overwhelming inflammatory responses. Despite the importance of TLR engagement in activating proinflammatory macrophages, relatively little is known about activation of intrinsic negative regulatory pathways to attenuate excessive inflammatory responses. In this study, we demonstrate that loss of diacylglycerol (DAG) kinase (Dgk) ζ, an enzyme which converts DAG into phosphatidic acid, limits inflammatory cytokine production in an arthritic mouse model dependent on TLR2 signaling and in a CSS mouse model dependent on TLR9 signaling. In vitro, Dgkζ deficiency results in reduced production of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β and in limited M1 macrophage polarization. Mechanistically, Dgkζ deficiency decreases STAT1 and STAT3 phosphorylation. Moreover, Dgkζ levels are increased in macrophages derived from mice with CSS or exposed to plasma from sJIA patients with active disease. Our data suggest that Dgkζ induction in arthritic conditions perpetuates systemic inflammatory responses mediated by macrophages and highlight a potential role of Dgkζ-DAG/phosphatidic acid axis as a modulator of inflammatory cytokine production in sJIA and CSS.

Totally endoscopic aortic valve replacement via an anterolateral approach using a standard prosthesis.  ;"OBJECTIVES: Totally endoscopic aortic valve replacement (AVR) is still a challenging operation, and only a few series reports exist in the literature. The purposes of this study were to establish a method for endoscopic AVR and evaluate its initial results. METHODS: A total of 47 patients (median age 76 years, 17 men) underwent endoscopic AVR. The main wound was created in the right anterolateral 4th intercostal space through a 4-cm skin incision. No rib spreader was used. A 3-dimensional endoscope was inserted at the midaxillary line. A 5.5-mm trocar was inserted in the 3rd intercostal space, thus creating a 3-port setting similar to that used for endoscopic mitral valve surgery. A standard prosthesis was used, and the sutures were tied using a knot pusher. Results were compared with those of 157 patients who underwent right transaxillary AVR with direct vision plus endoscopic assist. RESULTS: Patient backgrounds did not differ significantly between the 2 groups. No deaths occurred in the entire series. There was no conversion to thoracotomy or sternotomy in the endoscopic AVR group. The complication rate did not differ significantly between the 2 groups. The total operating time was significantly shorter in endoscopic AVR (188-206 min); the cardiopulmonary bypass time (130-128 min) and the cross-clamp time (90-95 min) did not differ significantly (median, endoscopic AVR, right transaxillary AVR). Two patients underwent endoscopic double-valve (aortic and mitral) surgery under the same conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic AVR was possible through 3 ports created in the right anterolateral chest, similar to the procedure for endoscopic mitral valve surgery. By adopting a common approach for both the aortic and the mitral valve operations, endoscopic double-valve surgery can be performed seamlessly.  "
Association of High Mortality With Postoperative Myocardial Infarction After Major Vascular Surgery Despite Use of Evidence-Based Therapies.  ;"IMPORTANCE: Patients undergoing vascular surgery are at high risk of postoperative myocardial infarction (POMI). Postoperative myocardial infarction is independently associated with significant risk of in-hospital mortality. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of patient and procedural characteristics with the risk of POMI after vascular surgery and determine the association of evidence-based therapies with longer-term outcomes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective cohort study of prospectively collected data within a statewide quality improvement collaborative database between January 2012 and December 2017. Patient demographics, comorbid conditions, and perioperative medications were captured. Patients were grouped according to occurrence of POMI. Univariate analysis and logistic regression were used to identify factors associated with POMI. The collaborative collects data from private and academic hospitals in Michigan. Patients undergoing major vascular surgery, defined as endovascular aortic aneurysm repair, open abdominal aortic aneurysm, peripheral bypass, carotid endarterectomy, or carotid artery stenting were included. Analysis began December 2018. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The presence of a POMI and 1-year mortality. RESULTS: Of 26 231 patients identified, 16 989 (65.8%) were men and the overall mean (SD) age was 69.35 (9.89) years. A total of 410 individuals (1.6%) experienced a POMI. Factors associated with higher rates of POMI were age (odds ratio [OR], 1.032 [95% CI, 1.019-1.045]; P < .001), diabetes (OR, 1.514 [95% CI, 1.201-1.907]; P < .001), congestive heart failure (OR, 1.519 [95% CI, 1.163-1.983]; P = .002), valvular disease (OR, 1.447 [95% CI, 1.024-2.046]; P = .04), coronary artery disease (OR, 1.381 [95% CI, 1.058-1.803]; P = .02), and preoperative P2Y12 antagonist use (OR, 1.37 [95% CI, 1.08-1.725]; P = .009). Procedurally, open abdominal aortic aneurysm (OR, 4.53 [95% CI, 2.73-7.517]; P < .001) and peripheral bypass (OR, 2.375 [95% CI, 1.818-3.102]; P < .001) were associated with the highest risk of POMI. After POMI, patients were discharged and received evidence-based therapy with high fidelity, including β-blockade (296 [82.7%]) and antiplatelet therapy (336 [95.7%]). A high portion of patients with POMI were dead at 1 year compared with patients without POMI (113 [37.42%] vs 993 [5.05%]; χ2 = 589.3; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Despite high rates of discharge with evidence-based therapies, the long-term burden of POMI is substantial, with a high mortality rate in the following year. Patients with diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and valvular disease warrant additional consideration in the preoperative period. Further, aggressive strategies to treat patients who experience a POMI are needed to reduce the risk of postoperative mortality.  "
Pathophysiologic Mechanisms of Subvalvular Repair and Its Clinical Implications.  ;"Comment in Ann Thorac Surg. 2020 Jul;110(1):345.  "
Incidence and Surgical Outcomes of Patients With Native and Prosthetic Aortic Valve Endocarditis.  ;"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the incidence and surgical outcomes of patients with native infective endocarditis (IE) and prosthetic aortic valve endocarditis (PVE) over the past decade at a single institution. METHODS: Between January 2005 and December 2015, 289 patients (mean age, 63.3 ± 14.2 years) suffering from native IE (n = 186) and PVE (n = 103) of the aortic valve underwent surgical procedures. Perioperative data were acquired retrospectively for statistical analysis. RESULTS: During the study period the mean incidence of endocarditis increased from 22.0 ± 4.2 (2005-2009) to 29.8 ± 10.1 (2010-2015) cases per year. In-hospital mortality was significantly increased in PVE (22.3%) versus IE (9.1%) patients (P < .001). In elective cases in-hospital mortality between the 2 groups was comparable (2.2% vs 4.6%; P = .288). Multivariate analysis identified urgent surgery (odds ratio [OR], 6.461; 95% CI, 1.941-21.509; P = .002), mitral regurgitation II (OR, 4.230; 95% CI, 1.249-14.331; P = .021), previous homograft operation (OR, 66.096; 95% CI, 2.369-1844.272; P = .0.14), and left ventricular ejection fraction < 40% (OR, 8.267; 95% CI, 1.931-35.388; P = .004) as independent risk factors for in-hospital mortality, whereas pathogen identification by preoperative blood cultures (OR, .228; 95% CI, 0.063-0.817; P = .023) was found to be independently protective. CONCLUSIONS: Surgery for native IE and PVE of the aortic valve may be performed with satisfactorily results at experienced cardiac surgical centers. In comparison PVE patients suffer from a more than twice as high in-hospital mortality, more postoperative complications, and inferior long-term survival. However preoperative identification of causative pathogens in IE and PVE allows for improved in-hospital survival.  "
Successful treatment of a paravalvular leak with balloon cracking and valve-in-valve TAVR.  ;Transcatheter heart valve implantation into degenerated bioprosthetic valves (ViV-THV implantation) has become an established procedure for high risk patients. In general, paravalvular leak (PVL) is a contraindication for valve-in-valve-TAVR (ViV-TAVR). Herein, we report on a 81-year-old patient presenting with acute heart failure for a failing aortic bioprosthesis (Medtronic Mosaic 27 mm). Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography during urgent ViV-TAVR revealed a PVL previously not detected. After transfemoral implantation of a 26 mm-Evolut-R, balloon-fracturing of the bioprosthetic ring was performed using a 24 mm True Dilatation balloon for treatment of the PVL. Afterward, left ventricular to aortic peak-to-peak pressure gradient measured 2-4mmHg. Transesophageal echocardiography merely revealed trace PVL. Aortic root angiography showed no PVL. At discharge, echocardiography measured a transprosthetic mean gradient of 5mmHg detecting no PVL. Intentional ring-fracturing of an aortic valve prostheses may prove not only to be effective in lowering transvalvular gradients after valve-in-valve-TAVR, but may also be a tool to treat PVL alongside degenerated surgical aortic bioprostheses in certain patients.  
Quantitative three-dimensional echocardiographic analysis of the bicuspid aortic valve and aortic root: A single modality approach.  ;"BACKGROUND: Patients with bicuspid aortic valves (BAV) are heterogeneous with regard to patterns of root remodeling and valvular dysfunction. Two-dimensional echocardiography is the standard surveillance modality for patients with aortic valve dysfunction. However, ancillary computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging is often necessary to characterize associated patterns of aortic root pathology. Conversely, the pairing of three-dimensional (3D) echocardiography with novel quantitative modeling techniques allows for a single modality description of the entire root complex. We sought to determine 3D aortic valve and root geometry with this quantitative approach. METHODS: Transesophageal real-time 3D echocardiography was performed in five patients with tricuspid aortic valves (TAV) and in five patients with BAV. No patient had evidence of valvular dysfunction or aortic root pathology. A customized image analysis protocol was used to assess 3D aortic annular, valvular, and root geometry. RESULTS: Annular, sinus and sinotubular junction diameters and areas were similar in both groups. Coaptation length and area were higher in the TAV group (7.25 ±  0.98 mm and 298 ± 118 mm2 , respectively) compared to the BAV group (5.67 ± 1.33 mm and 177 ± 43 mm2 ; P = .07 and P = .01). Cusp surface area to annular area, coaptation height, and the sub- and supravalvular tenting indices did not differ significantly between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Single modality 3D echocardiography-based modeling allows for a quantitative description of the aortic valve and root geometry. This technique together with novel indices will improve our understanding of normal and pathologic geometry in the BAV population and may help to identify geometric predictors of adverse remodeling and guide tailored surgical therapy.

Assessment of right ventricular dysfunction in patients with mitral stenosis: A speckle tracking study.  ;PURPOSE: Although it is affected at an early stage, there is a lack of studies investigating right ventricular (RV) function in patients with mitral stenosis (MS). We aimed to investigate the correlation between conventional echocardiographic variables and tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE), used as an indicator of RV dysfunction. METHODS: We enrolled 59 consecutive patients with MS and assigned them in group 1 if TAPSE ≤16, or group 2 if: TAPSE >16. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 42.2 ± 8 years, and 74.6% were females. In univariate analysis, maximal mitral valve gradient, mean mitral valve gradient, systolic pulmonary arterial pressure, RV strain, and RV strain rates were associated with RV dysfunction. In multivariate analysis, both strain variables were found to be independent predictors of RV dysfunction. Kaplan Maier survival analysis showed that patients with lower RV strain had more rehospitalization rate during the one-year follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: RV dysfunction is common in patients with MS and is associated with higher rehospitalization rate and morbidity. Evaluation of RV strain and strain rate for early detection of RV dysfunction and prediction of rehospitalization may be an appropriate approach in mitral stenosis.  
Mitral valve repair for posterior leaflet prolapse: Long-term comparison of loop implantation vs resection.  ;"BACKGROUND: Resection (triangular or quadrangular) is considered the gold standard for the treatment of posterior leaflet prolapse and loop implantation a more recent alternative. We aimed to compare the long-term outcomes of triangular or quadrangular resection vs loop implantation. METHODS: Single-centre, retrospective analysis of mitral valve (MV) surgeries conducted from January 2005 to December 2015. Propensity score matching was based on seven key baseline variables. RESULTS: Data from 721 patients were analyzed; 358 patients received loop implantation and 363 patients underwent resection. Patients had a mean age of 62 years, 33.0% were female and 50.6% had hypertension. Propensity score matching resulted in a matched group of 263 patients who received loop implantation or underwent resection, respectively. Postoperatively, the patients' mitral insufficiency was reduced from grade III/IV to either zero or trace (45.8%) or I (49.8%) and New York Heart Association class reduced from 66.9% in class III/IV preoperatively to 8.3% with no significant differences between groups. Fewer patients receiving loops had procedure-related complications. Fewer patients in the loop implantation group required permanent pacemaker implantation at 30 days (8.4% vs 2.3%; P = .002). The 10-year survival for patients in the resection (88.0%) and loop implantation (89.3%) groups had a hazard ratio of 1.224 (95% confidence interval, 0.633-2.367). CONCLUSION: Our study showed that both loop implantation and resection were associated with comparable long-term survival in patients with posterior leaflet prolapse. Loop implantation is associated with a significantly higher rate of a successful repair, a significantly lower rate of MV replacement after repair failure, fewer procedure-related complications and better 30-day at comparable long-term outcomes.

Percutaneous access and closure using the MANTA vascular closure device in transaxillary transcatheter aortic valve implantation.  ;DOI: 10.4244/EIJ-D-19-00809 PMID: 31793886 [Indexed for MEDLINE]  
Transcatheter mitral valve replacement (TMVR): annular or apical fixation?  ;AIMS: The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of two different transcatheter mitral valve replacement (TMVR) fixation strategies on the neo left ventricular outflow tract (neo-LVOT) and aorto-mitral angulation (AMA) after TMVR. METHODS AND RESULTS: Two different self-expanding nitinol valved stents were developed for transapical TMVR. In one group, the stents were fixed with an annular fixation system (ANN group, n=6). These prototypes were compared with an apical tether fixation TMVR system (AP group, n=11) in another group. Echocardiographic evaluation of the AMA and the neo-LVOT was conducted before and one hour after implantation. Maximal and minimal AMA (AMAmax and AMAmin) during the cardiac cycle of the AP group were significantly narrower than those of the ANN group (AMAmax: 39±8° vs 67±15°, p<0.001, AMAmin: 33±10° vs 56±22°, p=0.009). More severe reduction of the neo-LVOT diameter was observed in the ANN group (60±11% vs 26±14%, p<0.001). The ANN group had a higher peak velocity through the neo-LVOT post implantation (200±52 cm/s vs 108±15 cm/s, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The apical fixation system maintains a smaller and more stable aorto-mitral angulation and a larger neo-LVOT, thereby reducing the risk of postoperative neo-LVOT obstruction in this experimental setting.  
The contemporary role of echocardiography in the assessment and management of aortic stenosis.  ;Aortic stenosis (AS) represents a major healthcare issue because of its ever-increasing prevalence, poor prognosis, and complex pathophysiology. Echocardiography plays a central role in providing a comprehensive morphological and hemodynamic evaluation of AS. The diagnosis of severe AS is currently based on three hemodynamic parameters including maximal jet velocity, mean pressure gradient (mPG) across the aortic valve, and aortic valve area (AVA). However, inconsistent grading of AS severity is common when the AVA is < 1.0 cm2 but the mPG is < 40 mmHg, also known as low-gradient AS (LGAS). Special attention should be paid to patients with symptomatic LGAS with low stroke volume and/or low ejection fraction because this entity is more difficult to diagnose and has a worse prognosis. Stress echocardiography testing plays an important role in this disease entity. Elderly patients with prohibitive comorbidities for surgical aortic valve replacement (AVR) were without procedural options until the advent of transcatheter AVR (TAVR), which has dramatically changed these circumstances. Along with computed tomography, echocardiography plays a vital role in the periprocedural assessment of the aortic valve and surrounding apparatus. This review describes the evolution of the role of echocardiography in the diagnosis and management of AS, the complexity of the aortic apparatus, and the increased need for expert use of three-dimensional echocardiography.

Aortic Stenosis and Noncardiac Surgery in the Era of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.  ;Aortic stenosis (AS) is the most common form of valvular heart disease in the elderly. As this patient population continues to increase, anesthesiologists more often will encounter these patients in the perioperative setting for noncardiac surgical procedures. Cardiac risk during noncardiac surgery in the patient with AS appears to have decreased significantly compared with previous reports that shaped current practice guidelines for perioperative management. In addition, these guidelines preceded the publication of current data supporting the continually expanding role for transcatheter aortic valve replacement in the treatment of AS. In this review, the authors highlight the most recent evidence suggesting that an update of these guidelines is warranted. In addition, the accumulating evidence supporting the role for transcatheter aortic valve replacement to treat AS since the publication of guidelines is reviewed.

Transesophageal echocardiography in minimally invasive cardiac surgery.  ;PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) has made its way into the cardiac surgery realm and spurred the development of many interventions. In the domain of minimally invasive cardiac surgery (MICS), TEE has become central to reducing cardiovascular complications. RECENT FINDINGS: Real-time three-dimensional TEE is a key contributor to the safe and precise deployment of the PASCAL mitral valve repair system, which is showing great potential in ongoing studies. The current data on outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve replacement show that preprocedural three-dimensional TEE and multidetector computed tomography (CT) perform similarly in aortic root assessment. Three-dimensional color Doppler TEE has been suggested to be more appropriate in quantifying residual mitral regurgitation and evaluating the success of surgical or percutaneous closure. A three-dimensional TEE-derived aortomitral angle may be valuable in predicting and detecting dynamic left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, thereby enhancing the safety of transcatheter mitral valve replacement. SUMMARY: Advanced imaging modalities are essential for the sustained growth of MICS, particularly with the evolution of novel transcatheter systems. These techniques rely on exceptional imaging quality at all stages of the perioperative period to modify surgical-risk and improve patient outcomes. TEE has the additional benefit of providing real-time information on intrathoracic structures to guide intraoperative management.

TGF-β Signaling Promotes Tissue Formation during Cardiac Valve Regeneration in Adult Zebrafish.  ;Cardiac valve disease can lead to severe cardiac dysfunction and is thus a frequent cause of morbidity and mortality. Its main treatment is valve replacement, which is currently greatly limited by the poor recellularization and tissue formation potential of the implanted valves. As we still lack suitable animal models to identify modulators of these processes, here we used adult zebrafish and found that, upon valve decellularization, they initiate a rapid regenerative program that leads to the formation of new functional valves. After injury, endothelial and kidney marrow-derived cells undergo cell cycle re-entry and differentiate into new extracellular matrix-secreting valve cells. The TGF-β signaling pathway promotes the regenerative process by enhancing progenitor cell proliferation as well as valve cell differentiation. These findings reveal a key role for TGF-β signaling in cardiac valve regeneration and establish the zebrafish as a model to identify and test factors promoting cardiac valve recellularization and growth.

Doppler gradients, valve area and ventricular function in pregnant women with aortic or pulmonary valve disease: Left versus right.  ;"OBJECTIVE: Little is known about the course of echocardiographic parameters used for the evaluation of valvular heart disease (VHD) during pregnancy, hampering interpretation of possible changes (physiological vs. pathophysiological). Therefore we studied the course of these parameters and ventricular function in pregnant women with aortic and pulmonary VHD. METHODS: The cohort comprised 66 pregnant women enrolled in the prospective ZAHARA studies or evaluated by an identical protocol who had pulmonary VHD or aortic VHD (stenosis/prosthetic valve). The control group comprised 46 healthy pregnant women. Echocardiography was performed preconception, during pregnancy and 1 year postpartum. Peak gradient, mean gradient, aortic valve area (AVA)/effective orifice area (EOA), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and right ventricular function (RVF; TAPSE) were assessed. RESULTS: Peak and mean gradients increased during pregnancy compared to preconception in women with aortic VHD and controls (p < 0.0125), but not in women with pulmonary VHD. AVA/EOA remained unchanged. Preconception and postpartum gradients were comparable in all groups. Mean LVEF was normal in pregnant women with VHD and controls. Mean TAPSE was lower (p < 0.001) in women with pulmonary VHD compared to women with aortic VHD and controls (<20 mm vs. ≥23 mm; p < 0.001). In women with pulmonary VHD a decrease of TAPSE was observed during pregnancy (p = 0.005). CONCLUSION: Physiological changes during pregnancy lead to increased Doppler gradients in women with aortic VHD. This increase was not found in women with pulmonary VHD, probably caused by impaired RVF. Therefore, evaluation of RVF during pregnancy might be important to prevent underestimation of the degree of stenosis.  "
"An Alternative Approach to Build a ""Biologic Bentall"" From a Pericardial Tube and a Sutureless Valve.  ";This report describes a technique to create a biologic Bentall from a pericardial tube and a rapid deployment valve. This technique facilitates reimplantation of the coronary arteries because the proximal anastomosis is sewn before valve implantation and allows suturing of the coronary ostia from inside and outside, given that there is no interference with the implanted valve. Indications for this technique include complex redo cases and patients with contraindications to a conventional Bentall procedure. This technique has been used in 2 patients with good results.  
Childhood Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy and Its Relevant Surgical Outcome.  ;BACKGROUND: Contemporary experiences regarding childhood hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy are limited. This study aimed to describe the clinical presentation of childhood hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy and its relevant surgical outcome. METHODS: In all, 117 consecutive children with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy aged 0.6 to 17.5 years who underwent septal myectomy at our institution between February 2009 and December 2018 were included. Medical records and other patient-related data were reviewed. RESULTS: In the present study, the anatomic and physiologic characteristics of childhood hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy were highly heterogeneous, with simultaneous right ventricular outflow tract obstruction in 22 patients (18.8%), coronary myocardial bridging in 25 patients (21.4%), and intraventricular anatomic abnormalities in 61 patients (52.1%). The mean peak left or right ventricular outflow tract gradient, interventricular septal thickness, and degree of mitral regurgitation significantly decreased after surgery. One early death was noted in the study. During follow-up, three sudden cardiac deaths were noted. The overall survival rates at follow-up were 100% at 1 year and 96.5% at 3 years. The overall survival rates free from reoperation were 99.1% at 1 year and 98.0% at 3 years. CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort of children with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy undergoing septal myectomy, biventricular obstruction, myocardial bridging, and intraventricular anatomic abnormalities are frequent phenotypic components. Despite the complexity of childhood hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, surgical treatment results in a favorable outcome in carefully selected patients.  
Quadricuspid pulmonary valve: macroscopic and microscopic morphometric examination.  ;A quadricuspid pulmonary valve obtained upon autopsy of a 26-year-old male was examined. The macroscopic evaluation revealed three normal (posterior, right anterior and left anterior) leaflets and one additional leaflet of the pulmonary valve. Except that, the heart showed neither other anatomical variabilities nor any signs of heart disease. The additional leaflet was located between the left anterior and right anterior leaflets and was significantly smaller in size. Under the microscope, all leaflets showed preservation of the typical, layered structure. The thickness and extracellular matrix composition of the particular layers differed between the leaflets. Right ventricular myocardium (myocardial sleeves) exceeded the level of the hinge line in all three normal leaflets, which was not observed in the additional leaflet. Autonomic nerves and ganglia were not seen in the perivalvular epicardial adipose tissue surrounding the additional leaflet. The sinus wall of all the leaflets revealed typical organization of collagen bundles as well as elastic fibers and showed no signs of disruption. The abnormality seen in the structure of the pulmonary valve is likely to be a result of disturbed embryonic development and may affect the clinical management of patients with such variation.

Meta-Analysis of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation Versus Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement in Patients With Low Surgical Risk.  ;Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is the current standard of care for patients with severe aortic stenosis who are at high risk for surgery. However, several recent studies have demonstrated the comparable safety and efficacy of TAVI in low-risk patients as well. We sought to pool the existing data to further assert its comparability. MEDLINE, Cochrane, and Embase databases were evaluated for relevant articles published from January 2005 to June 2019. Studies comparing outcomes of TAVI versus surgical aortic valve replacement in patients who are at low risk for surgery were included. Twelve studies (5 randomized controlled trials and 7 observational studies) totaling 27,956 patients were included. Follow-up ranged from 3 months to 5 years. Short-term all-cause mortality, short-term, and 1-year cardiac mortality were significantly lower in the TAVI group. One-year all-cause mortality, short-term, and 1-year stroke and myocardial infarction were similar in both groups. Rate of acute kidney injury and new-onset atrial fibrillation were lower in the TAVI group, whereas permanent pacemaker implantation and major vascular complications were higher in the TAVI group. Subgroup analysis of randomized controlled trials showed significantly lower 1-year all-cause mortality in the TAVI group. In conclusion, in severe aortic stenosis patients at low surgical risk, TAVI when compared with surgical aortic valve replacement, demonstrated a lower rate of short-term all-cause mortality, short-term, and 1-year cardiac mortality and similar in terms of 1-year all-cause mortality. TAVI is emerging as a safe and efficacious alternative for low surgical risk patients.

Surgical Management and Outcomes of the Aortic Root in Acute Type A Aortic Dissection.  ;"BACKGROUND: This study evaluated the short- and middle-term outcomes of different aortic root managements in the setting of acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD): aortic root repair (ARR group), untouched aortic root (UAR group), and Bentall procedure (Bentall group). METHODS: The study enrolled 673 patients (512 men; age 48.8 ± 11.2 years) between 2010 and 2015. Survival, aortic growth, reintervention, and valve function were compared between the 3 groups. RESULTS: The ages were 50.6 ± 9.9, 49.8 ± 12.2, and 44.0 ± 12.0 years for ARR, UAR, and Bentall groups, respectively (P < .01). The mean follow-up time was 3.0 years (range, 0.5-6.8 years). The aortic root diameters in the groups were 39.0 ± 5.1 mm in ARR, 38.2 ± 4.4 mm in UAR, and 50.3 ± 6.2 mm in Bentall (P < .01). The overall 30-day mortality was 11.7% (79 of 673). There was no difference in 30-day mortality between the 3 groups (P = .58). The estimated aortic root growth rate was 0.60 ± 0.17 mm/y for ARR and 0.50 ± 0.14 mm/y for UAR. During follow-up, 28 patients (4.1%) died. Differences in 5-year survival between the 3 groups did not reach statistical significance (P = .82). Aortic insufficiency greater than grade 2+ developed in 15 patients (2.2%). There was no significant difference between ARR and UAR in freedom from aortic insufficiency greater than grade 2+ (P = .56). None of the patients experienced new dissection or underwent proximal reoperation during the follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: Conservative techniques (ARR and UAR) and aggressive root replacement can both be performed with excellent short- and middle-term outcomes in ATAAD. Thus, an individualized approach in managing the aortic root for ATAAD is recommended based on the patient's general condition, root pathology, and the surgeon's preference.  "
Impact of Lesion Localization on Durability of Mitral Valve Repair in Infective Endocarditis.  ;"BACKGROUND: Mitral valve (MV) repair for infective endocarditis (IE) is sometimes challenging. We investigated the durability of repair associated with the location of the infected lesion. METHODS: The study comprised 83 patients (55 ± 18 years; active, 66; healed, 17) who underwent MV repair at our institution. Patients were categorized into 5 types based on the location of the main lesion: type I, posterior leaflet (n = 36); type IIC, clear zone of anterior leaflet (n = 12); type IIR, rough zone of anterior leaflet (n = 28); and type III, annulus (n = 7). Type IIR was divided into 2 subgroups: IIR-large (>1 segment involvement, n = 9) and IIR-small (1 segment, n = 19). RESULTS: Follow-up was 95.2% completed for 7.2 ± 5.2 years. The rate of recurrent moderate or severe mitral regurgitation (MR) was 2.8% in type I, 0% in type IIC, 28.6% in type IIR, and 14.3% in type III. The freedom from recurrent moderate or severe MR was significantly lower in type IIR compared with the other types (63.1% ± 10.6% vs 96.8 ± 3.2% at 5 years, P < .001). Moreover, the recurrence rate was higher in type IIR-large (55.6%) than in type IIR-small (15.8%, P = .068). Type IIR was an independent predictor of recurrent MR (hazard ratio, 11.1, 95% confidence interval, 2.52-78.2; P = .001). CONCLUSIONS: The durability of MV repair for IE was satisfactory in posterior leaflet infection without annulus invasion and in clear zone infection of the anterior leaflet. However, rough zone infection of the anterior leaflet, especially with more than 1 segment involvement, was associated with a high risk of recurrent MR.  "
The Association Between Keratoconus and Mitral Valve Prolapse: A Meta-Analysis.  ;OBJECTIVE: The debate pertaining to the association between Keratoconus (KC) and Mitral Valve Prolapse (MVP) continues to occur among physicians. The results of cross-sectional studies attempting to present the co-existing prevalence of these two diseases remain indeterminate. We compiled the first meta-analysis to determine the pattern of prevalence between the two diseases. METHODS: Two separate literature searches for cross-sectional studies were performed for this metaanalysis. The first search encompassed finding literature comparing the prevalence of KC between patients with MVP and a control group. The second search pertained to finding studies comparing the prevalence of MVP patients with KC and a control group. RESULTS: Six studies reported the prevalence of MVP in patients with KC and a control group. The prevalence was 41.6% in patients with KC and 11.5% in patients without KC (OR = 7.06 [95% CI = 2.41-20.64]). There was a significant heterogeneity among the studies (I2 = 84%). Two studies showed the prevalence of KC in patients with MVP and a control group. The prevalence was 17.0% in patients with KC and 2.9% in the control group (OR = 5.07 [95% CI = 1.08-23.83]). There was no heterogeneity within the analysis (I2 = 0%). CONCLUSION: There is a statistically significant co-existing prevalence between MVP and KC. Patients with KC are more likely to present with MVP, and patients with MVP are more likely to present with KC.  
Meta-Analysis Comparing Results of Transcatheter Versus Surgical Aortic-Valve Replacement in Patients With Severe Aortic Stenosis.  ;"Transcatheter aortic-valve replacement (TAVR) has emerged as a promising strategy for treating patients with severe aortic stenosis. We aimed to compare TAVR with surgical aortic-valve replacement (SAVR) and determine the performance of TAVR over time and within several subgroups. We included 8 randomized trials comparing TAVR versus SAVR. Compared with SAVR, TAVR was associated with a lower rate of all-cause mortality or disabling stroke at 30-day (odds ratio [OR], 0.72; p = 0.004), 1-year (OR, 0.83; p = 0.01), and 2-year (OR, 0.86; p = 0.02), but not at long-term follow-up (rate ratio [RR], 1.02 [confidence interval 0.92 to 1.13]; p = 0.67). Notably, 5-year data showed numerically higher incidence in TAVR (RR, 1.11 [confidence interval 0.97 to 1.27]; p = 0.12). The risks associated with TAVR versus SAVR increased over time, showing a significant interaction (p for interaction = 0.01), as were for new-onset atrial fibrillation and rehospitalization. Incidences of major bleeding, new-onset fibrillation, and acute kidney injury were lower in TAVR, whereas transient ischemic attack, major vascular complications, permanent pacemaker implantation, reintervention, and paravalvular leak were lower in SAVR. Incidences for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction, and stroke were not statistically different. TAVR with transfemoral approach and new-generation valve was associated with reduction in all-cause mortality or disabling stroke compared with corresponding comparators. In conclusion, TAVR was associated with a lower risk for all-cause mortality or disabling stroke within 2 years, but not at long-term follow-up compared with SAVR; the risks seems to increase over time. More data are needed to determine longer-term performance of TAVR.  "

A New Method for Atrioventricular Valve Repair in Atrioventricular Septal Defect.  ;"The left atrioventricular valve in atrioventricular septal defect is conventionally repaired by suturing the ""cleft."" This can be complicated with stretching or dehiscence of the sutured zone by naturally diverging cordal traction and stenosis by restricting leaflet mobility. This complication prompted us to develop a different approach, especially for adults and adolescents, who might have undergone surgical repair previously. The technique consists of not closing or reopening the cleft, constructing neocordae connecting the cordless edge of each bridging leaflet to the opposite papillary muscle-that is, the papillary muscle to which it has no natural connection (""crossing neocordae"")-and inserting an annuloplasty ring.

Systemic-to-pulmonary shunt vs right ventricle to pulmonary artery connection in the treatment of pulmonary atresia, ventricular septal defect, and major aortopulmonary collateral arteries.  ;"OBJECTIVE: The systemic-to-pulmonary shunt (SPS) and right ventricle to pulmonary artery (RV-PA) connection were evaluated to pursue the goal of rehabilitating dysplastic native PAs via establishment of antegrade blood flow. However, the application of these two palliative operations was still confusing. We compared the two operations to determine their different effects on patients who have pulmonary atresia, ventricular septal defects, and major aortopulmonary collateral arteries (MAPCAs). METHODS: From January 2011 to January 2016, 44 patients received the SPS procedure, and 54 patients received the RV-PA connection procedure; these procedures were compared based on perioperative data and follow-up data. There was no significant difference between the two groups for follow-up time (15.5 ± 11.8 vs 11.4 ± 10 months; P = .073). RESULTS: The SPS patients had a smaller preoperative pulmonary artery index (68.57 ± 38.25 vs 112.62 ± 61.63 mm2 /m2 ; P < .01), more MAPCAs (2.4 ± 1.1 vs 1.8 ± 1.5; P = .045) and had a shorter intubation time (26.73 ± 27.20 vs 40.88 ± 36.93 hours; P = .045), intensive care unit stay (3.6 ± 3.9 vs 5.7 ± 5.5 days; P = .033), and hospital stay (9.9 ± 3.9 vs 14.7 ± 11.9 days; P = .014) than the RV-PA connection patients. The cumulative complete repair rate and cumulative survival rate did not differ significantly between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Both the SPS and the RV-PA connection could rehabilitate the PA and produce complete repair, while the SPS could achieve better early postoperative outcomes and be suitable for patients with severe dysplastic PAs and large MAPCAs.

Safety and effectiveness of a transaortic approach for TAVI: procedural and midterm outcomes of 265 consecutive patients in a single centre.  ;OBJECTIVES: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation with a transaortic approach (TAo-TAVI) is an alternative to transapical or femoral access. We studied the procedural and midterm efficacy and safety of TAo-TAVI with Edwards Sapien XT and Medtronic CoreValve devices. METHODS: Among 901 patients receiving TAVI since 2006, 265 consecutive patients underwent TAo-TAVI between January 2011 and September 2014. Procedural and midterm results were evaluated according to Valve Academic Research Consortium-2 criteria. RESULTS: The mean age was 83 ± 5 years. Sapien XT and CoreValve were used in 191 (72.1%) and 74 (27.9%) patients, respectively. Full sternotomy made elective concomitant off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting possible in 38 patients (14.3%) with severe coronary artery disease unsuitable for percutaneous coronary intervention. The device success rate was 95.5%. Postprocedural paravalvular leak  ≥2/4 was observed in 16 patients (6.4%). Emergency open chest surgery was required in 10 patients (3.8%) (3 aortic dissections, 3 valve embolizations, 2 LMCA occlusions, 1 aortic annulus rupture and 1 aortic rupture). Cerebrovascular accidents occurred in 3 patients (1.1%). Transfusions  ≥4 units were required in 36 patients (13.6%). New pacemakers were implanted in 26 patients (9.8%). Thirty-day and 1-year mortality were 8.7% and 16.2%, respectively. Mean follow-up duration was 24 ± 6 months. At 3 years, freedom from all-cause death was 80% ± 4%. New York Heart Association class <III included 81% (n = 172) of patients alive and without prosthetic echocardiographic dysfunction at follow-up (mean gradient 10.5 ± 5.6 mmHg). CONCLUSION: The TAo-TAVI approach confirms its safety and effectiveness with satisfactory procedural and midterm outcomes with both currently available devices.  
The Effects of Valvular Heart Disease on Atrial Conduction During Sinus Rhythm.  ;Different arrhythmogenic substrates for atrial fibrillation (AF) may underlie aortic valve (AV) and mitral valve (MV) disease. We located conduction disorders during sinus rhythm by high-resolution epicardial mapping in patients undergoing AV (n = 85) or MV (n = 54) surgery. Extent and distribution of conduction delay (CD) and block (CD) across the entire right and left atrial surface was determined from circa 1880 unipolar electrogram recordings per patient. CD and CB were most pronounced at the superior intercaval area (2.5% of surface, maximal degree 6.6%/cm2). MV patients had a higher maximal degree of CD at the lateral left atrium than AV patients (4.2 vs 2.3%/cm2, p = 0.001). A history of AF was most strongly correlated to CD/CB at Bachmann's bundle and age. Although MV patients have more conduction disorders at the lateral left atrium, disturbed conduction at Bachmann's bundle during sinus rhythm indicates the presence of atrial remodeling which is related to AF episodes.  
Determinants and consequences of positive valve culture when cardiac surgery is performed during the acute phase of infective endocarditis.  ;The optimal timing of cardiac surgery in infective endocarditis (IE) remains debated: Early surgery decreases the risk of embolism, and heart failure, but is associated with an increased rate of positive valve culture. To determine the determinants, and the consequences, of positive valve culture when cardiac surgery is performed during the acute phase of IE, we performed a retrospective study of adult patients who underwent cardiac surgery for definite left-sided IE (Duke Criteria), in two referral centres. During the study period (2002-2016), 148 patients fulfilled inclusion criteria. Median age was 65 years [interquartile range, 53-73], male-to-female ratio was 2.9 (110/38). Cardiac surgery was performed after 14 days [5-26] of appropriate antibiotics. Valve cultures returned positive in 46 cases (31.1%). Factors independently associated with positive valve culture were vegetation size ≥ 10 mm (OR 2.83 [1.16-6.89], P = 0.022) and < 14 days of appropriate antibacterial treatment before surgery (OR 4.68 [2.04-10.7], P < 0.001). Positive valve culture was associated with increased risk of postoperative acute respiratory distress syndrome (37.0% vs. 15.7%, P = 0.008) but was associated neither with an increased risk of postoperative relapse nor with the need for additional cardiac surgery. Duration of appropriate antibacterial treatment and vegetation size are independently predictive of positive valve culture in patients operated during the acute phase of IE. Positive valve culture is associated with increased risk of postoperative acute respiratory distress syndrome.  
Clinical and echocardiographic features of paradoxical low-flow and normal-flow severe aortic stenosis patients with concomitant mitral regurgitation.  ;"Mitral regurgitation (MR) coexists in a significant proportion of patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS), and portends inferior therapeutic outcomes. In severe AS, MR is thought to contribute to a low-flow state by decreasing forward stroke volume. We investigated concomitant MR on the clinical and echocardiographic features of patients with ""paradoxical"" low-flow (PLF) and normal-flow (NF) severe AS. Clinical and echocardiographic profiles of 886 consecutive patients with index echocardiographic diagnosis of severe AS (AVA < 1.0 cm2) were analysed retrospectively. All patients had preserved ejection fraction (LVEF  ≥ 50%, n = 645), and were divided into PLF (stroke volume index, SVI < 35 mL/m2) and NF AS. They were then further subdivided based on the presence or absence of moderate-or-severe MR (msMR). A higher prevalence of concomitant msMR was observed in patients with PLF AS (14.9%; n = 33/221) compared to those with NF AS (8.0%; n = 34/424). Concomitant msMR was associated with echocardiographic features of increased diastolic dysfunction in both PLF AS and NF AS patients, as evidenced by increased LA diameter (PLF AS 52.9 ± 12.5 to 43.9 ± 8.9 mm; NF AS 29.6 ± 10.8 to 42.4 ± 8.8 mm; p < 0.001) and increased transmitral E/A ratio (PLF AS 1.26 ± 0.56 to 0.92 ± 0.43; NF AS 1.19 ± 0.63 to 0.94 ± 0.45; p = 0.004). Amongst patients with NF AS, msMR was additionally associated with increased E:e' ratio (25.5 ± 15.1 vs 19.3 ± 10.8; p = 0.025). Concomitant MR was more common in PLF AS compared to NF. Although possibly related to the MR, patients severe AS and MR appeared to have more severe diastolic dysfunction. Further studies are warranted to evaluate prognosis and guide management.  "
Heart failure biomarker levels correlate with invasive haemodynamics in pulmonary valve replacement.  ;BACKGROUND: Although widely used in cardiology, relation of heart failure biomarkers to cardiac haemodynamics in patients with CHD (and in particular with pulmonary insufficiency undergoing pulmonary valve replacement) remains unclear. We hypothesised that the cardiac function biomarkers N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), soluble suppressor of tumorigenicity 2, and galectin-3 would have significant associations to right ventricular haemodynamic derangements. METHODS: Consecutive patients ( n = 16) undergoing cardiac catheterisation for transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement were studied. NT-proBNP, soluble suppressor of tumorigenicity 2, and galectin-3 levels were measured using a multiplex enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay from a pre-intervention blood sample obtained after sheath placement. Spearman correlation was used to identify significant correlations (p ≤ 0.05) of biomarkers with baseline cardiac haemodynamics. Cardiac MRI data (indexed right ventricular and left ventricular end-diastolic volumes and ejection fraction) prior to device placement were also compared to biomarker levels. RESULTS: NT-proBNP and soluble suppressor of tumorigenicity 2 were significantly correlated (p < 0.01) with baseline mean right atrial pressure and right ventricular end-diastolic pressure. Only NT-proBNP was significantly correlated with age. Galectin-3 did not have significant associations in this cohort. Cardiac MRI measures of right ventricular function and volume were not correlated to biomarker levels or right heart haemodynamics. CONCLUSIONS: NT-proBNP and soluble suppressor of tumorigenicity 2, biomarkers of myocardial strain, significantly correlated to invasive pressure haemodynamics in transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement patients. Serial determination of soluble suppressor of tumorigenicity 2, as it was not associated with age, may be superior to serial measurement of NT-proBNP as an indicator for timing of pulmonary valve replacement.  
Opioid-Related Adverse Events: Incidence and Impact in Patients Undergoing Cardiac Surgery.  ;"Purpose. Opioid-related adverse drug events (ORADEs) increase patient length of stay (LOS) and health care costs. However, ORADE rates may be underreported. This study attempts to understand the degree to which ORADEs are underreported in Medicare patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Materials and Methods. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services administrative claims database was used to identify ORADEs in 110 158 Medicare beneficiaries who underwent cardiac valve (n = 50 525) or coronary bypass (n = 59 633) surgery between April 2016 and March 2017. The International Classification of Disease (ICD)-10 codes specifically linked to ORADEs were used to identify an actual ORADE rate, while additional ICD codes, clinically associated with butas not specific to adverse drug events were analyzed as potential ORADEs. Length of stay (LOS) and hospital daily revenue were analyzed among patients with or without a potential ORADE. Results. Among patients undergoing valve or bypass surgery, the documented ORADE rate was 0.7% (743/110 158). However, potential ORADEs may have occurred in up to 32.4% (35 658/110 158) of patients. In patients with a potential ORADE, mean LOS was longer (11.4 vs 8.2 days; P < .0001) and mean Medicare revenue/day was lower ($4016 vs $4412; P < .0001). The mean net difference in revenue/day between patients with and without an ORADE varied between $231 and $1145, depending on the Diagnosis-Related Group analyzed. Conclusions. ORADEs are likely underreported following cardiac surgery. ORADEs can be associated with increased LOS and decreased hospital revenue. Understanding the incidence and economic impact of ORADEs may expedite changes to postoperative pain management. Adopting multimodal pain management strategies that reduce exposure to opioids may improve outcomes by reducing complications, side effects, and health care costs.  "
Living Donor Liver Transplantation Following Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation for Aortic Valvular Disease.  ;Over the last few decades, outcomes with living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) have improved significantly. This has resulted in patients who were denied liver transplantation previously, due to various comorbidities and high risk, now being considered for LDLT. This includes patients with severe valvular heart disease such as aortic stenosis. These patients require aortic valve replacement to help cope with significant perioperative hemodynamic changes. High-risk cardiac procedures like aortic valve replacement are associated with serious perioperative morbidity and mortality in patients with end-stage liver disease. Since the advent of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in 2002, there have been a few case reports of its successful use prior to deceased donor liver transplantation, but there is no literature on this procedure before LDLT. In this article, we report our experience with 2 patients, the first patient with infective endocarditis-induced acute aortic regurgitation and the second patient with bicuspid aortic stenosis who underwent uneventful TAVI followed by successful LDLT. In conclusion, with the increasing expertise and experience in this procedure, an increasing number of potential recipients, previously considered as high-risk transplant candidates, can now be offered liver transplantation by performing pretransplant TAVI.  
Intramuscular Immunization of Streptococcus pyogenes SF370 protein extract and identification of multiple virulence factors through proteomic profiling in RHD induced Balb/c mice.  ;Group A streptococcus (GAS) and autoimmunity are associated with heart related mitral valve damage, in adults. In this study Balb/c mice were intramuscularly immunized with S. pyogenes SF370 for 4 weeks. Prior to euthanization, physiological parameters like body weight and electrical signalling of the heart were recorded. After euthanization, the heart tissue homogenate was prepared and proteomic alterations were studied using SDS-PAGE and 2D electrophoresis. The expression levels of inflammatory genes like TNFα, IFNγ and TGF-β were quantified using real time PCR. Insilico analysis was performed to identify the functions of hypothetical proteins and virulence factors involved in the induction of rheumatic carditis. The results showed a reduction in body weight, ulceration, inflammation, cardiac lesions and prolonged PR interval in mice immunized with S. pyogenes SF370, as a result of RHD. The heart related proteins like α-actinin, fatty acid binding protein-heart, myosin light chain 3, hemoglobin subunit alpha, myoglobin regulatory light chain 2, (ventricular/cardiac muscle isoform), myosin-6, troponin-1 were found to be up-regulated when compared with the control. The functional annotation of S. pyogenes (SF370) was carried out by retrieving 1696 identified proteins and 653 hypothetical protein sequences in NCBI genome database. The conserved domain was identified for 505 proteins. The pfam database documented that the super families of 279 sequences and 40 signal peptides enabled the classification of proteins in different categories like biological (20%), cellular (22%) and molecular functions (36%). Putative transcription repair coupling factor and putative lysine aminopeptidase N terminal are the two virulence factors identified by VICMPRED in S. pyogenes SF370. The two identified virulence factors are involved in altering the mice heart proteome and thereby controlling the streptococcus pyogenes infection. Thus, the results of the present study reveals the role of immunogenic proteins in induction of rheumatic carditis and to elucidate the molecular mechanisms leading to autoimmune reactions in Balb/c mice.  
Outcomes and Quality of Life After Ross Reintervention: Would You Make the Same Choice Again?  ;BACKGROUND: The Ross procedure was introduced as a long-term if not definitive solution for aortic pathology. However, the rate of reoperation is not negligible. METHODS: This single-center prospective study assessed the general outcome of Ross reoperation and patients' perceived quality of life compared with 2 control groups (Ross non-reoperation and mechanical aortic valve replacement). Patient's preference regarding the choice between mechanical aortic valve and Ross procedure was investigated in a subgroup that could theoretically have been directed to either of the 2 procedures. RESULTS: Between 2005 and 2017, 64 consecutive patients underwent reoperation after Ross. Median age was 31 years. Median freedom from reoperation after the Ross procedure was 136 months. An autograft reoperation was required in 49, and 25 had homograft failure. No in-hospital death was recorded. Mean follow-up was 77 months (range, 6-164 months). Quality of life was assessed with the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey questionnaire. The Ross reoperation group showed a lower score involving psychological concerns compared with the other groups. In the reoperated-on patients group, 52 had adequate aortic annulus dimensions to receive a prosthetic valve instead of a Ross procedure. When asked whether they would make the same choice, only 31% confirmed the preference. CONCLUSIONS: Reoperations after Ross procedure have low mortality and morbidity. Long-term follow-up showed a high quality of life, even after reoperations. However, owing to psychological concerns after the redo operation, when choosing a Ross procedure, it is our duty to thoroughly explain to patients that a high level of disillusion is predictable in case of reoperations.

Tricuspid atresia with absent pulmonary valve and intact ventricular septum: successful bidirectional cavopulmonary anastomosis with complete exclusion of the right ventricle.  ;Tricuspid atresia with absent pulmonary valve and intact ventricular septum is an extremely rare cardiac malformation, historically associated with a poor prognosis. Only a few cases with successful surgical palliation have been reported in the literature. We present the case of an 8-month-old infant with this malformation who underwent successful bidirectional cavopulmonary anastomosis with complete exclusion of the right ventricle.  
Effect of Preoperative Tricuspid and/or Mitral Regurgitation on Development of Late Right-Sided Heart Failure After Insertion of the HeartWare Left Ventricular Assist Device.  ;"Right-sided heart failure (RHF) after left ventricular assist device implantation is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Although multiple predictors of early RHF have been described, information on late RHF is scarce. The aim of this study was to identify predictors of late RHF in left ventricular assist device patients. A retrospective analysis of all adult patients who underwent HeartWare-ventricular assist device implantation as a bridge to transplantation in a single-centre was performed. Late RHF was defined as RHF requiring rehospitalization after 30 days of implantation. A total of 16 (10.3%) patients from 156 implantations developed late RHF. Median time to late RHF onset was 182.5 (interquartile range 105 to 618) days. Patients developing late RHF were older at surgery. A significantly higher rate of moderate or severe tricuspid regurgitation before implantation was found in patients presenting with late RHF (81.2% vs 33.5%; p <0.001). Several echocardiographic parameters at discharge postimplant, such as significant mitral regurgitation, demonstrated a strong association with late RHF. A multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that significant preoperative tricuspid regurgitation was the strongest predictor of late RHF (hazard ratio 5.50, 95% confidence interval [1.34 to 22.58]; p = 0.02). Significant mitral regurgitation postimplantation and older age also significantly predicted late RHF. In conclusion, preoperative significant tricuspid regurgitation and mitral regurgitation after implantation predict the occurrence of late RHF.  "
Survival of activated myofibroblasts in canine myxomatous mitral valve disease and the role of apoptosis.  ;Myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) is the single most important acquired cardiovascular disease of the dog. Much is known about the cellular changes and the contribution of activated myofibroblasts (valve interstitial cells (aVICs) to the valve extra-cellular matrix remodelling characteristic of the disease. However, little is known on how aVIC survival might contribute to disease pathogenesis. This study examined the temporal (disease severity-dependent) and spatial distribution of aVICs in MMVD valves, the expression of a range of apoptosis-related genes in cultured VICs from both normal (quiescent VIC (qVIC) and diseased (aVIC) valves, and the differential effects of doxorubicin treatment, as a trigger of apoptosis, on expression of the same genes. Activated myofibroblasts were identified in normal valves at the valve base only (the area closest to the annulus), and then became more numerous and apparent along the valve length as the disease progressed, with evidence of cell survival at the valve base. There were no significant differences in basal gene expression comparing qVICs and aVICs for CASP3, FAS, BID, BAX, BCL2, CASP8, DDIAS, XIAP and BIRC5. After doxorubicin treatment (2 mM) for 8 h there was significant difference (P < .05) in the expression of BID, BCL2, DDIAS, and CASP8, but when assessed for interactions using a mixed model ANOVA only CASP8 was significantly different because of treatment (P < .05). These data suggest aVIC survival in MMVD valves may be a consequence of heightened resistance of aVICs to apoptosis, but would require confirmation examining expression of the relevant proteins.

Surgical treatment results of secondary tunnel-like subaortic stenosis after congenital heart disease operations: A 7-year, single-center experience in 25 patients.  ;OBJECTIVE: To summarize the surgical results of secondary tunnel-like subaortic stenosis (STSS) after congenital heart disease (CHD) operations, the pathogenesis of STSS is analyzed and its operative effect and prognosis are evaluated. METHODS: We analyzed clinical data from 25 patients who underwent surgical repair for STSS in Fuwai Hospital from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2015. There were 17 males and 8 females. The types of CHD included a double outlet right ventricle (DORV), a ventricular septal defect (VSD), and partial atrioventricular septal defects (PAVSDs). The median age of the patients at the time of their first CHD operation was 1 year (1 month to 42 years). The median age of the patients at the time of STSS repair was 5 years and 8 months (2 years and 10 months to 48 years). The surgical types included the modified Konno procedure, Konno procedure, fibromuscular resection (FMR), and removal and reconstruction of the intraventricular baffle (RRIB). RESULTS: All patients successfully received STSS repair. There were no surgical deaths in this study. The preoperative gradient across the left ventricular outflow tract was 81 (43-159) mm Hg, and the postoperative gradient was 8.2 (4-46.2) mm Hg. On the basis of the surgical techniques used for subaortic stenosis repair, we divided the patients into three subgroups: the Konno group (n = 11), the FMR group (n = 11), and the RRIB group (n = 3). Preoperatively, there was no significant difference in the gradient between the Konno group and the FMR group (ΔP, P = .287), but the Konno group was significantly better than the FMR group postoperatively (ΔP, P = .022). There were no significant statistical differences between the RRIB group and the other two groups in all these data. A third-degree atrioventricular block occurred in two patients after the operation, and both patients required a permanent pacemaker. All patients were followed up after discharge for a median duration of 5 years (3-9 years). During the follow-up period, none of the patients had any clinical symptoms or subaortic restenosis, and there was no late death. CONCLUSIONS: Secondary subaortic stenosis (SSS) occurs after DORV surgery. The Konno operation or the RRIB can be selected for surgical correction, which is more satisfactory and safer for the treatment of stenosis. For patients with SSS after the operation of VSD or PAVSD, the FMR can be chosen for the operation. The operation is relatively simple, the operation time is short and the effect is satisfactory. Existing problems include that the incidence of a third-degree atrioventricular block is slightly higher after the operation.  
Self-expandable valve-in-valve treatment for failing sutureless aortic bioprosthesis.  ;Aortic valve replacement still represents the gold standard treatment for severe symptomatic aortic stenosis. Sutureless bioprostheses have been so far developed to enhance the minimally invasive approach, resulting in a reduction of cross-clamp time. Even if the first implantation was carried out more than 10 years ago, some cases of valve degeneration treated with balloon-expandable valve-in-valve procedures have been previously described in the literature. Here, we present a case of early sutureless valve degeneration resulting in severe aortic regurgitation. After careful evaluation of the patient's comorbidities, a successful valve-in-valve was finally performed using a self-expandable transcatheter prosthesis. A wide discussion of the Heart Team decision-making process and of the technical aspects has been addressed.  
Concomitant surgical aortic valve replacement with bilateral orthotopic lung transplantation.  ;Concomitant cardiac surgery at the time of lung transplantation while uncommon has been shown to have acceptable morbidity and mortality. We present a case of a 66-year-old man with a history of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis with end-stage lung disease who presented with moderate aortic stenosis and severe aortic regurgitation. He underwent a bioprosthetic surgical aortic valve replacement at the time of bilateral orthotopic lung transplant and recovered without any major complications.

Sodium thiosulphate and progression of vascular calcification in end-stage renal disease patients: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study.  ;"BACKGROUND: Sodium thiosulphate (NaTS) is mostly used in haemodialysis (HD) patients with calcific uraemic arteriolopathy. This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study assessed the effect of NaTS on progression of cardiovascular calcifications in HD patients. METHODS: From 65 screened patients, we recruited 60 patients with an abdominal aorta Agatston calcification score ≥100. Thirty patients were randomized to receive NaTS 25 g/1.73 m2 and 30 patients to receive 100 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride intravenously during the last 15 min of HD over a period of 6 months. The primary endpoint was the absolute change of the abdominal aortic calcification score. RESULTS: The abdominal aortic calcification score and calcification volume of the abdominal aorta increased similarly in both treatment groups during the trial. As compared with the saline group, patients receiving NaTS exhibited a reduction of their iliac artery calcification score (-137 ± 641 versus 245  ± 755; P = 0.049), reduced pulse wave velocity (9.6  ± 2.7 versus 11.4 ± 3.6; P = 0.000) and a lower carotid intima-media thickness (0.77  ± 0.1 versus 0.83  ±  00.17; P = 0.033) and had better preservation of echocardiographic parameters of left ventricular hypertrophy. No patient of the NaTS group developed new cardiac valve calcifications during the trial as compared with 8 of 29 patients in the saline group. By univariate analysis, NaTS therapy was the only predictor of not developing new valvular calcifications. No adverse events possibly related to NaTS infusion were noted. CONCLUSIONS: While NaTS failed to retard abdominal aortic calcification progress, it positively affected calcification progress in iliac arteries and heart valves as well as several other cardiovascular functional parameters.

Echocardiographic outcomes from seven randomized trials of transcatheter versus surgical aortic valve replacement.  ;AIMS: We performed meta-analyses of echocardiographic outcomes, including postprocedural aortic valve area (AVA), aortic valve mean pressure gradient (MPG), and paravalvular aortic regurgitation (PAR), exclusively from all currently available randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) versus surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). METHODS: To identify all RCTs providing echocardiographic outcomes (AVA, MPG, and PAR) up to 2 years after TAVI versus SAVR, PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched through June 2019. Mean differences in AVA (and MPG) between the TAVI and SAVR groups and odds (or hazard) ratios of at least moderate PAR for TAVI versus SAVR were pooled using the random-effects meta-analysis. RESULTS: We identified seven eligible RCTs. At 30 days (P = 0.004), 1 year (P = 0.006), and 2 years (P = 0.03), AVA was significantly larger after TAVI than after SAVR. After TAVI than after SAVR, MPG was significantly lower at 30 days (P = 0.03) and 2 years (P = 0.01), and nonsignificantly lower at 1 year (P = 0.06). At 30 days (P < 0.00001), 1 year (P < 0.00001), and 2 years (P < 0.00001), incidence of at least moderate PAR was significantly greater after TAVI than after SAVR. CONCLUSION: On the basis of the present meta-analyses of all the seven currently available RCTs, AVA is larger, MPG is lower, and incidence of at least moderate PAR is greater 30 days, 1 and 2 years after TAVI than after SAVR.  
Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction in HIV-uninfected infants exposed in utero to antiretroviral therapy.  ;OBJECTIVES: To longitudinally measure LV diastolic function in HIV-exposed but uninfected (HEU) children perinatally exposed to ART. DESIGN: HEU children who were perinatally exposed to antiretroviral therapy (ART) may be at risk for adverse cardiac effects. We have previously reported that those children have decreased left ventricular (LV) mass, dimension, and septal thickness with increased contractility. METHODS: Serial echocardiograms were obtained at specific times from birth to 48 months from two groups of HIV-uninfected children: 148 HIV-negative children who were perinatally exposed to ART and 130 non-ART-exposed HIV-unexposed healthy controls. The following LV diastolic indices were obtained: mitral valve early and late diastolic velocity (E and A), tissue Doppler-derived LV-free wall and septal early diastolic velocity (LV e' and sep e'). RESULTS: All echocardiographic indices were significantly different in ART-exposed children compared with ART-unexposed healthy controls. Both E and A were overall lower at all ages by 8.28 cm/s (P = 0.0002) and 13.46 cm/s (P < 0.0001) respectively. E/A ratio was higher by 0.27, 0.46, and 0.28 units at birth, 1 year and 2 years of age, respectively (all P ≤ 0.01). Moreover, LV e' and sep e' were overall lower at all ages by 0.84 cm/s (P = 0.01) and 0.47 cm/s (P = 0.02), respectively. CONCLUSION: Children who were exposed to ART in utero have subclinical yet significant differences in specific LV diastolic indices. Follow-up with serial echocardiograms are recommended in this population to further assess the potential cardiac toxicity of perinatal exposure to ART.  
In-hospital and thirty-day outcomes of the SAPIEN 3 Ultra balloon-expandable transcatheter aortic valve: the S3U registry.  ;AIMS: The aim of this study was to evaluate 30-day safety and efficacy outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) performed with the SAPIEN 3 Ultra system. METHODS AND RESULTS: The S3U registry is a physician-led, post-approval, multicentre, observational registry of transfemoral TAVI with the SAPIEN 3 Ultra. New features include an improved sealing skirt, a 14 Fr expandable sheath and a new delivery catheter. Overall, 139 consecutive patients at nine participating centres were enrolled. Mean age was 81.4±8.3 years, average STS score 3.8±2.4%. The vast majority (97.2%) underwent TAVI with local anaesthesia (28.8%) or conscious sedation (68.3%). Balloon predilatation was performed in 30 patients (21.6%), post-dilatation in three (2.2%). In-hospital, there were no cases of death, stroke, or conversion to open heart surgery. Major vascular complications occurred in three patients (2.2%), as well as major or life-threatening bleedings in three patients (2.2%). There were two moderate (1.4%) and no moderate/severe paravalvular leaks. Median length of stay after TAVI was three days (IQR 3-5 days). At 30 days, there were no deaths, MI, or strokes, and the incidence of new permanent pacemaker implantation was 4.4%. CONCLUSIONS: This first multicentre international experience of transfemoral TAVI with the SAPIEN 3 Ultra transcatheter heart valve shows good in-hospital and 30-day clinical outcomes.  
Outcomes in nonagenarians undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation: a nationwide analysis.  ;"AIMS: The aim of this study was to describe the midterm outcomes in nonagenarians undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). METHODS AND RESULTS: Based on the French administrative hospital discharge database, the study collected information for all consecutive patients with aortic stenosis (AS), and specifically those treated with TAVI between 2010 and 2018. Cox regression was used for the analysis of predictors of events. We compared patients according to their age. Within the studied period, 71,095 patients older than 90 years with AS were identified. After matching on baseline characteristics, TAVI was associated with lower rates of a combined outcome of all-cause death, rehospitalisation for heart failure and stroke (relative risk [RR] 0.58, p<0.001) in comparison with matched nonagenarians with AS treated medically. During follow-up (median 161 days, interquartile range 13-625), the combined outcome occurred more frequently in nonagenarians (RR 1.22, p<0.01) who had a TAVI than in younger patients undergoing this procedure. All-cause death was reported in 17.6% versus 14.5% of nonagenarians, rehospitalisation for heart failure in 21.3% versus 18.2%, and stroke in 3.7% versus 2.9% (p<0.01 for all parameters). We identified the Charlson comorbidity index, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, stroke, vascular disease, cognitive impairment and denutrition as independent predictors of adverse outcomes in nonagenarians undergoing TAVI. CONCLUSIONS: Among nonagenarians with AS, patients treated with TAVI had a lower risk of cardiovascular events than matched patients treated medically. The patients undergoing a TAVI at this age were often highly selected; the procedure was associated with acceptable long-term outcomes.  "
The Predictors of Peri-Procedural and Sub-Acute Cerebrovascular Events Following TAVR from OCEAN-TAVI Registry.  ;"BACKGROUND: Cerebrovascular events (CVEs) are not uncommon complications of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Our study aimed to determine the predictors of peri-procedural and sub-acute CVEs following TAVR. METHODS: Using the Japanese multicenter registry, we evaluated 1613 patients undergoing TAVR between October-2013 and July-2016. Occurrences of 24-hour and 1- to 30-day CVEs were evaluated to clarify the predictors of CVEs following TAVR. RESULTS: The mean age was 84.4 years and mean Society of Thoracic Surgeons score was 8.3%. Overall 24-hour and 30-day CVE rates were 1.2% and 2.7%, respectively. A multivariate analysis demonstrated that independent predictor of 24-hour CVEs was index aortic valve area (iAVA) [adjusted OR (adjusted-OR), 0.001; 95% CI, 0.001-0.13; p = .005]. The receiver operator curve derived cut-off value of iAVA for the prediction of 24-hour CVEs was 0.40 cm2/m2. In contrast, independent predictors of 1- to 30-day CVEs were paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF; adjusted-OR, 3.35; 95% CI, 1.36-8.27; p = .009) and iAVA after TAVR (adjusted-OR, 0.11; 95% CI, 0.02-0.66; p = .02). Consequently, independent predictors of 30-day CVEs were prior stroke (adjusted-OR, 2.18; 95% CI, 1.07-4.45; p = .03), PAF (adjusted-OR, 2.18; 95% CI, 1.05-4.56; p = .04), and prior coronary artery disease (adjusted-OR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.01-3.48; p = .05). CONCLUSIONS: Within 24 h, small iAVA impacted the increased risk of CVEs, whereas PAF and iAVA after TAVR impacted the increased risk of 1- to 30-day CVEs following TAVR. The mechanism of CVEs might differ according to onset.  "

Multiple mycotic aneurysms of the aortic root after aortic valve replacement.  ;A 74-year-old woman with severe aortic valve stenosis underwent aortic valve replacement with a pericardial bioprosthesis. Histological analysis of the excised valve showed dystrophic calcification associated with signs of healed infective endocarditis. Two months later, the patient died due to congestive heart failure. Autopsy revealed a bowel infarction and the presence of multiple mycotic aneurysms of the aortic root with mural thrombosis, which were unnoticed during the patient hospital stay and surgical window.  
"Postmortem diagnosis of left dominant arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy: the importance of a multidisciplinary network for sudden death victims. ""HIC mors gaudet succurere vitae"".  ";An apparently healthy man died suddenly at the age of 49 during physical activity. The heart was referred to our Cardiovascular Pathology Unit for valve tissue banking. Pathology findings led to the diagnosis of arrhythmogenic left ventricular cardiomyopathy. Molecular autopsy was performed and two variants of interest were identified in genes associated with arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy. The 19-year-old son underwent a cardiac screening comprehensive of electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiogram, cardiac magnetic resonance and genetic testing, and the diagnosis of arrhythmogenic left ventricular cardiomyopathy was achieved. This case report highlights the need of a systematic evaluation of all sudden death victims with autopsy performed by expert cardiovascular pathologists and implemented by molecular analysis, aiming to identify also rare hereditary diseases and activate proper family screening.  
A detailed mechanical and microstructural analysis of ovine tricuspid valve leaflets.  ;The tricuspid valve ensures unidirectional blood flow from the right atrium to the right ventricle. The three tricuspid leaflets operate within a dynamic stress environment of shear, bending, tensile, and compressive forces, which is cyclically repeated nearly three billion times in a lifetime. Ostensibly, the microstructural and mechanical properties of the tricuspid leaflets have mechanobiologically evolved to optimally support their function under those forces. Yet, how the tricuspid leaflet microstructure determines its mechanical properties and whether this relationship differs between the three leaflets is unknown. Here we perform a microstructural and mechanical analysis in matched ovine tricuspid leaflet samples. We found that the microstructure and mechanical properties vary among the three tricuspid leaflets in sheep. Specifically, we found that tricuspid leaflet composition, collagen orientation, and valve cell nuclear morphology are spatially heterogeneous and vary across leaflet type. Furthermore, under biaxial tension, the leaflets' mechanical behaviors exhibited unequal degrees of mechanical anisotropy. Most importantly, we found that the septal leaflet was stiffer in the radial direction and not the circumferential direction as with the other two leaflets. The differences we observed in leaflet microstructure coincide with the varying biaxial mechanics among leaflets. Our results demonstrate the structure-function relationship for each leaflet in the tricuspid valve. We anticipate our results to be vital toward developing more accurate, leaflet-specific tricuspid valve computational models. Furthermore, our results may be clinically important, informing differential surgical treatments of the tricuspid valve leaflets. Finally, the identified structure-function relationships may provide insight into the homeostatic and remodeling potential of valvular cells in altered mechanical environments, such as in diseased or repaired tricuspid valves. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Our work is significant as we investigated the structure-function relationship of ovine tricuspid valve leaflets. This is important as tricuspid valves fail frequently and our current approach to repairing them is suboptimal. Specifically, we related the distribution of structural and cellular elements, such as collagen, glycosaminoglycans, and cell nuclei, to each leaflet's mechanical properties. We found that leaflets have different structures and that their mechanics differ. This may, in the future, inform leaflet-specific treatment strategies and help optimize surgical outcomes.  
Chronic Type A Aortic Dissection After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.  ;An 87-year-old man with a hostile ascending aorta who underwent transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) using a 26-mm Sapien 3 valve (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA) 2 years earlier presented with chronic type A aortic dissection, which was retrospectively caused by the edge of the pusher of the TAVR implantation system. Redo sternotomy and extraction of the Sapien valve, followed by replacement of the ascending aorta and the aortic valve, were performed successfully. Retrospective image analysis showed the importance of respecting the anatomy of the ascending aorta before considering transfemoral TAVR.  
Modified Transcatheter Hufnagel Procedure as a Bridge to Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement.  ;The history of aortic valve surgery began with the Hufnagel procedure. In 1953, Hufnagel reported the first successful treatment of aortic insufficiency by the implantation of a ball-valve prosthesis into the descending aorta. We present a 33-year-old male patient with a complicated surgical history needing a sixth-time redo aortic valve replacement for severe prosthetic paravalvular leak in the presence of fresh intracranial hemorrhage. His deteriorating clinical picture was successfully temporized by a transcatheter valve placement in the descending aorta (modified Hufnagel procedure). This report illustrates a potential role of a modified Hufnagel procedure as a bridge to definitive surgery.  
Valve Interstitial Cell-Specific Cyclooxygenase-1 Associated With Calcification of Aortic Valves.  ;BACKGROUND: The molecular mechanisms underlying aortic valve calcification are poorly understood. Here, we aimed to identify the master regulators of calcification by comparison of genes in valve interstitial cells (VICs) with calcified and noncalcified aortic valves. METHODS: Calcified aortic valves were surgically excised from patients with aortic valve stenosis who required aortic valve replacements. Noncalcified and calcified sections were obtained from aortic valve leaflets. Collagenase-digested tissues were seeded into dishes, and VICs adhering to the dishes were cultured for 3 weeks, followed by comprehensive gene expression analysis. Functional analyses of identified proteins were performed by in vitro calcification assays. Tissue localization was determined by immunohistochemical staining for normal (n = 11) and stenotic valves (n = 30). RESULTS: We found 87 genes showing greater than a twofold change in calcified tissues. Among these genes, 68 were downregulated and 19 were upregulated. Cyclooxygenase-1 (COX1) messenger RNA and protein levels were upregulated in VICs from calcified tissues. The COX1 messenger RNA and protein levels in VICs were also strongly increased by stimulation with osteoblast differentiation medium. These were VIC-specific phenotypes and were not observed in other cell types. Immunohistochemical staining revealed that COX1-positive VICs were specifically localized in the calcified area of aortic valve tissues. CONCLUSIONS: The VIC-specific COX1 overexpression played a crucial role in calcification by promoting osteoblast differentiation in aortic valve tissues.  
Predictors of In-Hospital Mortality after Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.  ;"The development of aortic valve stenosis is strongly associated with older adults. Patients who undergo transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) for severe aortic stenosis frequently have heart failure (HF). We investigated the predictors of mortality after TAVI according to the presence of HF, and specifically HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) versus HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Patients were identified from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample registry from January 2011 to September 2015 using the ICD-9 codes. Patients with HF who underwent TAVI were classified according to whether they were diagnosed with HFrEF or HFpEF. The principal outcome of interest was in-hospital mortality. Multivariable analysis was used to adjust for potential baseline confounders. Among 11,609 patients undergoing TAVI, 6,368 (54.9%) had baseline HF, including 4,290 (67.4%) with HFpEF and 2,078 (32.6%) with HFrEF. In TAVI patients with HF, in-hospital mortality was also not significantly different in those with HFrEF compared with HFpEF (3.66% vs 3.17%, respectively; adjusted odds ratio 1.14, 95% confidence interval 0.84 to 1.53; p = 0.38). Polyvalvular heart disease was an additional independent predictor of in-hospital mortality in HFrEF, whereas age, liver disease, and the absence of depression and anemia were additional independent predictors of mortality in HFpEF. In conclusion, baseline HF in patients undergoing TAVI is prevalent and is more commonly due to HFpEF than HFrEF. Mortality is similar in those with HFrEF and HFpEF. Knowledge of the specific predictors of mortality after TAVI in HF patients may be useful for patient selection and prognostic guidance.  "
Third generation dual source CT with ultra-high pitch protocol for TAVI planning and coronary tree assessment: feasibility, image quality and diagnostic performance.  ;PURPOSE: To evaluate the feasibility, image quality (IQ) and diagnostic performance of third generation 192 × 2 dual source computer tomography (DSCT) with ultra-high pitch acquisition for trans-catheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) planning and coronary tree assessment. METHOD: In this prospective study, 223 patients underwent to DSCT for TAVI. Coronary calcium scoring (CCS) was calculated. Attenuation values were measured at aortic levels, femoral and coronary arteries. IQ was evaluate with a 4-point scale. The CT performance, in the assessment of coronary stenosis ≥50 % and ≥70 %, was compared with invasive coronary angiography (ICA), served as reference standard. Aortic annulus (AoA) CT derived area and implanted prosthesis size were correlate with Spearman's test. RESULTS: Attenuation values >400HU were obtain in all segments. IQ median value was ≥ 3. In the assessment of stenosis ≥50 %, on a segment-based analysis, CT sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values and diagnostic accuracy were 97.6 %, 87.6 %, 64.2 %, 99.0 % and 89.6 %, on patient-based analysis were 97.8 %, 88.8 %, 68.8 %, 99.4 % and 90.6 %, respectively. In the assessment of stenosis ≥70 %, on segment-based analysis, were 88.5 %, 83.8 %, 54.7 %, 96.8 % and 84.8 %, and on patient-based analysis were 92.5 %, 85.8 %, 58.7 %, 98.1 % and 87.0 %, respectively. The CT performed better in the group with lower CCS. A direct correlation was found between AoA CT derived area and prosthesis size. CONCLUSION: DSCT, using a single prospective ECG-triggered ultra-high pitch acquisition, is feasible for TAVI planning and in the assessment of coronary stenosis. CT performed worse in patients with severe coronary calcifications.  
Establishing a new human hypertrophic cardiomyopathy-specific model using human embryonic stem cells.  ;Symptom of ventricular hypertrophy caused by cardiac troponin T (TNNT2) mutations is mild, while patients often showed high incidence of sudden cardiac death. The 92nd arginine to glutamine mutation (R92Q) of cTnT was one of the mutant hotspots in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). However, there are no such human disease models yet. To solve this problem, we generated TNNT2 R92Q mutant hESC cell lines (heterozygote or homozygote) using TALEN mediated homologous recombination in this study. After directed cardiac differentiation, we found a relative larger cell size in both heterozygous and homozygous TNNT2 R92Q hESC-cardiomyocytes. Expression of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase2a (SERCA2a) were downregulated, while myocyte specific enhancer factor 2c (MEF2c) and the ratio of beta myosin to alpha myosin heavy chain (MYH7/MYH6) were increased in heterozygous TNNT2 R92Q hESC-cardiomyocytes. TNNT2 R92Q mutant cardiomyocytes exhibited efficient responses to heart-related pharmaceutical agents. We also found TNNT2 R92Q heterozygous mutant cardiomyocytes showed increased calcium sensitivity and contractility. Further, engineered heart tissues (EHTs) prepared by combining rat decellularized heart extracellular matrices with heterozygous R92Q mutant cardiomyocytes showed similar drug responses as to HCM patients and increased sensitivity to caspofungin-induced cardiotoxicity. Using RNA-sequencing of TNNT2 R92Q heterozygous mutant cardiomyocytes, we found dysregulation of calcium might participated in the early development of hypertrophy. Our hESC-derived TNNT2 R92Q mutant cardiomyocytes and EHTs are good in vitro human disease models for future disease studies and drug screening.  
Identification of a novel compound heterozygous IDUA mutation underlies Mucopolysaccharidoses type I in a Chinese pedigree.  ;BACKGROUND: Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) is a rare autosomal storage disorder resulting from the defective alpha-L-iduronidase (encoded by IDUA) enzyme activity and accumulation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in lysosomes. So far, more than 100 IDUA causative mutations have been identified leading to three MPS I phenotypic subtypes: Hurler syndrome (severe form), Hurler/Scheie syndrome (intermediate form), and Scheie syndrome (mild form). METHODS: Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed to identify the underlying genetic mutations. To verify the identified variations, Sanger sequencing was performed for all available family members following PCR amplification. The impact on IDUA protein was analyzed by sequential analysis and homology modeling. RESULTS: A novel IDUA heterozygous single base insertion (c.1815dupT, p.V606Cfs51* ) and a known missence mutation (c.T1037G, p.L346R) were detected in our patient diagnosed as congenital heart disease with heart valve abnormalities. The novel frameshift mutation results in a complete loss of 48 amino acids in the Ig-like domain and causes the formation of a putative protein product which might affect the IDUA enzyme activity. CONCLUSIONS: A novel compound heterozygous IDUA mutation (c.1815dupT, p.V606Cfs51* ) was found in a Chinese MPS I family. The identification of the mutation facilitated accurate genetic counseling and precise medical intervention for MPS I in China.

Estimation of the Severity of Aortic Insufficiency by HVAD Flow Waveform.  ;"PURPOSE: Aortic insufficiency (AI) significantly affects morbidity and mortality in patients with left ventricular assist devices. Although AI may be commonly assessed by echocardiography, expert techniques are required for accurate quantification of AI severity. DESCRIPTION: In this prospective blinded study, screenshots from the HVAD (Medtronic, Framingham, MA) display and simultaneous echocardiographic measurements were obtained. Each screenshot was digitized and the early diastolic phase slope was calculated, with blinding to the echocardiographic results. The regurgitant fraction of AI was quantified by Doppler echocardiography of the outflow graft. EVALUATION: A total of 30 patients (median, 57 years old; 57% male) were enrolled. A cutoff of -17.6 L/min/s for the early diastolic phase slope had a sensitivity of 0.92 and a specificity of 0.53 to estimate significant AI with a regurgitant fraction of 30% or greater, and it significantly stratified patients into a low regurgitant faction group (0.3%) and a high regurgitant fraction group (33.0%) (P = .009). The early diastolic phase slope had a moderate correlation with the actually measured regurgitant fraction (r = .50). CONCLUSIONS: The early diastolic phase slope of the HVAD flow waveform may be a parameter that can estimate the presence of clinically significant AI.  "

Meta-analysis of impact of troponins on mortality after transcatheter aortic valve implantation.  ;"INTRODUCTION: To determine whether troponin (Tn) can predict mortality after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), we performed a meta-analysis of currently available studies investigating impact of baseline and postprocedural Tn. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched through April 2019 using PubMed and OVID. Studies considered for inclusion met the following criteria: the study investigating impact of baseline and postprocedural Tn on mortality; the study population was patients undergoing TAVI for aortic stenosis (AS); outcomes included early (30-day or in-hospital)/late (including early) mortality. For each study, data regarding early/late mortality in both high and low (defined in each study) level of baseline/postprocedural Tn groups were used to generate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), or reported ORs and hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs were directly extracted. Study-specific estimates were combined using inverse variance-weighted averages of logarithmic ORs/HRs in the random-effects model. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: We identified 19 eligible studies including a total of 7555 patients undergoing TAVI. Pooled analyses demonstrated associations of high levels of baseline Tn with statistically significant increases in both 30-day (P=0.002) and midterm mortality (P<0.00001), no correlation of high postprocedural Tn with 30-day mortality (P=0.13), and an association of high postprocedural Tn with a statistically significant increase in midterm mortality (P=0.002). High levels of baseline/postprocedural TnT predicted statistically significant increases in both 30-day (P=0.002/<0.0001) and midterm mortality (P<0.00001/0.0003). CONCLUSIONS: Both baseline and postprocedural Tn, especially TnT, may predict mortality after TAVI for AS.  "
Antiatherogenic properties of high-density lipoproteins from arterial plasma are attenuated as compared to their counterparts of venous origin.  ;"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: High-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles play atheroprotective roles by their ability to efflux cholesterol from foam cells and to protect low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) from oxidative damage in the arterial intima. We hypothesized that antioxidative properties of HDLs can be attenuated in the oxygen-rich prooxidative arterial environment, contributing to the development of atherosclerosis. To evaluate this hypothesis, we compared antioxidative activity of HDLs from arterial and venous plasmas. METHODS AND RESULTS: Arterial and venous blood samples were simultaneously obtained from 16 patients (age 68 ± 10 years; 75% males) presenting with ischemic or valvular heart disease. Major HDL subfractions and total HDLs were isolated by density gradient ultracentrifugation and their chemical composition and the capacity to protect LDLs from in vitro oxidation were evaluated. HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides and apolipoprotein (apo) B-100 levels were slightly but significantly reduced by -4 to -8% (p < 0.01) in the arterial vs. venous samples. Total mass of HDL subpopulations was similar and HDL subpopulations did not reveal marked compositional differences between the arterial and venous circulation. Potent antioxidative activity of the small, dense HDL3c subpopulation was significantly reduced in the particles of arterial origin vs. their counterparts from venous plasma (increase of +21% in the propagation rate of LDL oxidation, p < 0.05). Interestingly, antioxidative properties of venous HDLs were enhanced in statin-treated patients relative to untreated subjects. CONCLUSION: Antioxidative properties of small, dense HDLs from arterial plasma are attenuated as compared to the particles of venous origin, consistent with the development of atherosclerosis in the arterial wall.

Procedures and Outcomes of Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement in Adults.  ;The ideal aortic valve substitute remains elusive. Bioprosthetic valves are the replacement option of choice in elderly patients undergoing aortic valve replacement (AVR). When implanted in young and middle-aged adults, both bioprosthetic and mechanical valves are associated with excess mortality compared with the age- and sex-matched general population. The Ross procedure is the only operation that can restore normal life expectancy in young and middle-aged adults undergoing AVR. In this article, the authors review the various options for surgical AVR and examine their contemporary applications and outcomes.  
Prevalence and Prognostic Implications of Frailty in Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.  ;Assessment of frailty has become engrained in the preprocedural evaluation of older adults referred for transcatheter aortic valve replacement. Addition of frailty and disability to clinical risk scores results in improved discrimination for short- and midterm mortality and identifies patients less likely to be discharged home and more likely to report worsening quality of life over the ensuing 6 to 12 months. In clinical practice, frailty can be evaluated by a tiered approach starting with a brief screening tool such as the Essential Frailty Toolset.  
Heart Valve Clinics, Centers, and Networks.  ;There is consensus on important aspects of managing heart valve disease. Despite this, many patients are managed by general physicians or cardiologists without specialist competencies in valve disease, which leads to suboptimal outcomes. Multidisciplinary heart valve clinics bring together cardiologists, surgeons, nurses, and in some countries scientists to deliver expert guidelines and experience-driven optimal care. Patients are referred at the optimal time for interventions at heart valve centers, defined by strict standards of facilities and processes. Valve networks link valve clinic, heart valve center, and the community to improve the passage of patients at every level of care.  
Aortic Stenosis: Guidelines and Evidence Gaps.  ;Current guidelines for management of adults with aortic stenosis recommend aortic valve replacement for patients with clinical consequences due to hemodynamically severe valve obstruction. However, advances in surgical and transcatheter techniques, and improved valve design have led to decreased procedural risk and improved long-term outcomes. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is recommended for patients with prohibitive surgical risk and is reasonable in intermediate and high-risk patients. Recent trials demonstrated favorable short-term outcomes in patients with low surgical risk undergoing TAVR compared with surgical AVR. We review the current Guidelines recommendations and highlight key controversies in management due to evidence gaps.  
Biomarkers Associated with Aortic Stenosis and Structural Bioprosthesis Dysfunction.  ;"Prediction of patients at risk of aortic valve stenosis (AS), AS progression rate, and aortic bioprosthesis dysfunction are of major importance for clinical management and/or prevention. Many imaging modalities may be used; however, they may not be conclusive or available for all patients. Circulating biomarkers are easily available and may be related to a disease or process such as aortic valve calcification or associated with a risk factor of the disease. This article reviews current blood biomarkers associated with aortic valve stenosis/calcification and bioprosthesis dysfunction.  "
Aortic Stenosis with Other Concomitant Valvular Disease: Aortic Regurgitation, Mitral Regurgitation, Mitral Stenosis, or Tricuspid Regurgitation.  ;Aortic stenosis presenting as part of a multiple valve disease scenario or as mixed valve disease is frequent. These scenarios induce hemodynamic interactions that may result in diagnostic pitfalls. Echocardiography is the cornerstone technique for diagnosis of valve disorders, but other modalities may be useful. In addition to assessment of each individual lesion, the heart valve team must integrate numerous parameters into the management strategy, including global assessment of clinical and hemodynamic effects, operative risk, life expectancy, natural history of untreated valve disease, valve reparability, and/or suitability for single or multiple transcatheter valve procedures.  
Assessment of Cardiac Damage in Aortic Stenosis.  ;Severe aortic stenosis (AS) causes chronic pressure overload of the left ventricle (LV), resulting in the progressive cardiac damage, which extends beyond the LV. Several previous studies have shown a relationship of the cardiac damage to AS, rather than the stenosis severity, with adverse events after aortic valve replacement (AVR) in patients with severe AS. A new staging system for AS patients has important prognostic implications for clinical outcomes after AVR. This review summarizes the importance of assessment of cardiac damage in patients with AS.  
Aortic Stenosis: What Risks Do the Stresses of Noncardiac Surgery or Pregnancy Pose and How Should They Be Managed?  ;Studies suggest that patients with aortic stenosis have increased risk in pregnancy and delivery and during anesthesia and surgery, although there are significant degrees of uncertainty as to the exact risks and best way to manage such patients. This article reviews current literature regarding impact of aortic stenosis on pregnancy and anesthesia during noncardiac surgery. There are shortcomings in the scientific evidence. Most of the available studies are observational and often retrospective and therefore there is a great deal of bias. This leads to difficulty in drawing conclusions in terms of how to apply the published information to clinical management.  
Sex Differences in the Pathophysiology, Diagnosis, and Management of Aortic Stenosis.  ;For years, calcific aortic stenosis (AS) was considered to be similar in men and women, and the underrepresentation of women in research studies prevented any alternate conclusions. With new sex-specific studies and data, the landscape of AS is evolving and recently important sex-disparities were revealed. These sex-specific discrepancies are of utmost importance to stratify and personalize treatment according to sex. It is important and urgent to elucidate the sex-related differences and similarities in the pathophysiology of AS to develop and validate sex-specific approaches for the management and pharmacologic treatment of AS, and to improve clinical outcomes for both sexes.  
Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: Procedure and Outcomes.  ;Initially, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) was only used in patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis and prohibitive risk for surgical aortic valve replacement. Subsequently, TAVR was extended to patients with high and intermediate surgical risk. Recently, the results of randomized trials in low-surgical-risk patients showed superiority or noninferiority of TAVR versus surgical aortic valve replacement in this population. Procedural outcomes have been improved. Long-term durability of transcatheter heart valves remains to be confirmed. This article presents the evolution and current status of TAVR, with respect to the different types of devices and procedures as well as its outcomes.

Pathophysiology of Aortic Stenosis and Future Perspectives for Medical Therapy.  ;Calcific aortic valve stenosis is the commonest form of heart valve disease in high-income countries and set to become a major health care burden. Currently, there are no medical therapies that have proved to slow down or halt disease progression. The only available treatment is aortic valve replacement, of which the optimal timing is unknown and to which not all patients are suited. This review discusses the pathophysiology of aortic stenosis, how noninvasive imaging techniques have improved our understanding of the underlying biology, and how these emerging insights might translate into potential novel treatments targeting oxidized lipids, fibrosis, and calcification.  
Alternative mechanical heart valves for the developing world.  ;Due to the prevalence of rheumatic heart disease in the developing world, mechanical heart valves in the younger patient population remain the prostheses of choice if repair is not feasible. Despite their durability, mechanical valves are burdened by coagulation and thromboembolism. Modern design tools can be utilized during the design process of mechanical valves, which allow a more systematic design approach and more detailed analysis of the blood flow through and around valves. These tools include computer-aided design, manufacturing, and engineering, such as computational fluid dynamics and finite element analysis, modern manufacturing techniques such as additive manufacturing, and sophisticated in-vitro and in-vivo tests. Following this systematic approach, a poppet valve was redesigned and the results demonstrate the benefits of the method. More organized flow patterns and fewer complex fluid structures were observed. The alternative trileaflet valve design has also been identified as a potential solution and, if a similar design approach is adopted, it could lead to the development of an improved mechanical heart valve in the future. It is imperative that researchers in developing countries continue their search for a mechanical heart valve with a reduced thromboembolic risk, requiring less or no anticoagulation.

A novel MYBPC3 c.2737+1 (IVS26) G>T mutation responsible for high-risk hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  ;BACKGROUND: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is an autosomal dominant hereditary disease characterised by left ventricular asymmetry hypertrophy. However, our knowledge of the genetic background in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy cases is limited. Here, we aimed to evaluate pathogenic gene mutations in a family with high-risk hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and analyse the genotype/phenotype relationships in this family. METHODS: The proband, her parents, and her niece underwent whole-exome sequencing, and the genotypes of family members were identified using Sanger sequencing. mRNA expression was detected using reverse transcription sequencing. Structural impairments were predicted by homologous modelling. A family survey was conducted for patients with positive results to obtain information on general clinical symptoms, electrocardiography, ambulatory electrocardiography, echocardiography, and 3.0T cardiac magnetic resonance findings. Regular follow-up was performed for up to 6 months. RESULTS: Five family members, including the proband, carried a cleavage site mutation in the MYBPC3 gene (c.2737+1 (IVS26) G>T), causing exon 26 of the MYBPC3 gene transcript to be skipped and leading to truncation of cardiac myosin-binding protein C. Family survey showed that the earliest onset age was 13 years old, and three people had died suddenly at less than 40 years old. Three pathogenic gene carriers were diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and all showed severe ventricular septal hypertrophy. CONCLUSION: The c.2737+1 (IVS26) G>T mutation in the MYBPC3 gene led to exon 26 skipping, thereby affecting the structure and function of cardiac myosin-binding protein C and leading to severe ventricular hypertrophy and sudden death.

Blueberry anthocyanin‑enriched extract ameliorates transverse aortic constriction‑induced myocardial dysfunction via the DDAH1/ADMA/NO signaling pathway in mice.  ;Blueberry anthocyanin‑enriched extract (BAE) has been demonstrated to protect against cardiovascular diseases by activating multiple target genes. The present study investigated the effects of BAE on transverse aortic constriction (TAC)‑induced myocardial dysfunction in mice and explored its possible molecular mechanisms. A total of 30 male mice were divided randomly into control, TAC and TAC + BAE groups. Mice in the TAC + BAE groups were administered BAE by oral gavage for 6 consecutive weeks. Myocardial dysfunction was assessed using echocardiogram, histopathology, TUNEL assay, immunofluorescence staining, reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR and western blot analysis. The results demonstrated that BAE treatment significantly ameliorated heart weight, left ventricular weight, myocardial dysfunction, left ventricular hypertrophy and fibrosis. In addition, BAE treatment alleviated TAC‑induced inflammation, oxidative stress and apoptosis. Notably, BAE treatment markedly reduced asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) concentration and significantly increased dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase 1 (DDAH1) expression and nitric oxide (NO) production. The present data indicated that BAE treatment ameliorated TAC‑induced myocardial dysfunction, oxidative stress, inflammatory response and apoptosis via the DDAH1/ADMA/NO signaling pathway.  
Improvement in VO(2peak) predicts readmissions for cardiovascular disease and mortality in patients undergoing cardiac rehabilitation.  ;BACKGROUND: Improvement in exercise capacity is a main goal of cardiac rehabilitation but the effects are often lost at long-term follow-up and thus also the benefits on prognosis. We assessed whether improvement in VO2peak during a cardiac rehabilitation programme predicts long-term prognosis. METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a retrospective analysis of 1561 cardiac patients completing cardiac rehabilitation in 2011-2017 in Copenhagen. Mean age was 63.6 (11) years, 74% were male and 84% had coronary artery disease, 6% chronic heart failure and 10% heart valve replacement. The association between baseline VO2peak and improvement after cardiac rehabilitation and being readmitted for cardiovascular disease and/or all-cause mortality was assessed with three different analyses: Cox regression for the combined outcome, for all-cause mortality and a multi-state model. During a median follow-up of 2.3 years, 167 readmissions for cardiovascular disease and 77 deaths occurred. In adjusted Cox regression there was a non-linear decreasing risk of the combined outcome with higher baseline VO2peak and with improvement of VO2peak after cardiac rehabilitation. A similar linear association was seen for all-cause mortality. Applying the multi-state model, baseline VO2peak and change in VO2peak were associated with risk of a cardiovascular disease readmission and with all-cause mortality but not with mortality in those having an intermediate readmission for cardiovascular disease. CONCLUSION: VO2peak as well as change in VO2peak were highly predictive of future risk of readmissions for cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality. The predictive value did not extend beyond the next admission for a cardiovascular event.  
Five-year results of a modified left atrial maze IV procedure in the treatment of atrial fibrillation: a randomized study.  ;BACKGROUND: The left atrial maze IV (LAM-IV) alone has been used to eliminate atrial fibrillation (AF) without severe right heart diseases. However, we felt that it could be improved and developed a modified LAM-IV (MLAM-IV). In this prospective trial, we aimed to investigate 5-year clinical outcomes of AF in patients treated by the novel MLAM-IV technique. METHODS: Between September 2012 and October 2013, 120 patients who underwent valve surgery and bipolar radiofrequency ablation for AF were randomized into the LAM-IV group (n = 60) or MLAM-IV group (n = 60). At postoperative follow-up examinations, data were recorded at 1, 3 and 6 months, and annually thereafter. RESULTS: The mean ablation time and postoperative ventilation time were shorter in the MLAM-IV group than in the LAM-IV group (P < 0.001 and P = 0.03, respectively). At 5 years, the rate of freedom from AF was 69.0% in the MLAM-IV group and 60.0% in the LAM-IV group (hazard ratio 0.71, 95% confidence interval 0.39 to 1.32, P = 0.42). There were no differences with respect to the early operative mortality and major complications, late mortality, and major adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: The MLAM-IV provides a technically simpler ablation process. The MLAM-IV was associated with less ventilation support in the early postoperative period. The long-term efficacy of the MLAM-IV in the treatment of AF is comparable to that of the LAM-IV.  
Systems immunology reveals a linked IgG3-C4 response in patients with acute rheumatic fever.  ;Acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and chronic rheumatic heart disease (RHD) are autoimmune sequelae of a Group A streptococcal infection with significant global mortality and poorly understood pathogenesis. Immunoglobulin and complement deposition were observed in ARF/RHD valve tissue over 50 years ago, yet contemporary investigations have been lacking. This study applied systems immunology to investigate the relationships between the complement system and immunoglobulin in ARF. Patients were stratified by C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration into high (≥10 μg mL-1 ) and low (<10 μg mL-1 ) groups to distinguish those with clinically significant inflammatory processes from those with abating inflammation. The circulating concentrations of 17 complement factors and six immunoglobulin isotypes and subclasses were measured in ARF patients and highly matched healthy controls using multiplex bead-based immunoassays. An integrative statistical approach combining feature selection and principal component analysis revealed a linked IgG3-C4 response in ARF patients with high CRP that was absent in controls. Strikingly, both IgG3 and C4 were elevated above clinical reference ranges, suggesting these features are a marker of ARF-associated inflammation. Humoral immunity in response to M protein, an antigen implicated in ARF pathogenesis, was completely polarized to IgG3 in the patient group. Furthermore, the anti-M-protein IgG3 response was correlated with circulating IgG3 concentration, highlighting a potential role for this potent immunoglobulin subclass in disease. In conclusion, a linked IgG3-C4 response appears important in the initial, inflammatory stage of ARF and may have immediate utility as a clinical biomarker given the lack of specific diagnostic tests currently available.  
In fetuses with congenital lung masses, decreased ventricular and atrioventricular valve dimensions are associated with lesion size and clinical outcome.  ;INTRODUCTION: The clinical importance of mass effect from congenital lung masses on the fetal heart is unknown. We aimed to report cardiac measurements in fetuses with congenital lung masses and to correlate lung mass severity/size with cardiac dimensions and clinical outcomes. METHODS: Cases were identified from our institutional database between 2009 and 2016. We recorded atrioventricular valve (AVVz) annulus dimensions and ventricular widths (VWz) converted into z scores, ratio of aortic to total cardiac output (AoCO), lesion side, and congenital pulmonary airway malformation volume ratio (CVR). Respiratory intervention (RI) was defined as intubation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), or use of surgical intervention prior to discharge. RESULTS: Fifty-two fetuses comprised the study cohort. Mean AVVz and VWz were below expected for gestational age. CVR correlated with ipsilateral AVVz (RS = -.59, P < .001) and ipsilateral VWz (-0.59, P < .001). Lower AVVz and AoCO and higher CVR were associated with RI. No patient had significant structural heart disease identified postnatally. CONCLUSION: In fetuses with left-sided lung masses, ipsilateral cardiac structures tend to be smaller, but in our cohort, there were no patients with structural heart disease. However, smaller left-sided structures may contribute to the need for RI that affects a portion of these fetuses.  
Life expectancy of patients undergoing surgical aortic valve replacement compared with that of the general population.  ;OBJECTIVES: Surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) changes the natural history of severe aortic stenosis. However, whether the life expectancy of patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing this surgical procedure is fully restored is unknown. The objective of this study was to assess if the life expectancy of patients aged >75 years is fully restored after undergoing surgery for severe aortic stenosis. METHODS: We compared long-term survival of a group of patients aged >75 years, who underwent SAVR at our institution with the long-term survival of the general population. We matched each patient with 100 simulated individuals (control group) of the same age, sex and geographical region who died as indicated by the National Institute of Statistics. We compared survival curves and calculated hazard ratio (HR) or incidence rate ratio. Statistical significance existed if confidence intervals (CIs) did not overlap or did not include the value 1, as appropriate. RESULTS: Average life expectancy of surgical patients who survived the postoperative period was 90.91 months (95% CI 82.99-97.22), compared to 92.94 months (95% CI 92.39-93.55) in the control group. One-, 5- and 8-year survival rates for SAVR patients who were discharged from the hospital were 94.9% (95% CI 92.74-96.43%), 71.66% (95% CI 67.37-75.5%) and 44.48% (95% CI 38.14-50.61%), respectively, compared to that of the general population: 95.8% (95% CI 95.64-95.95%), 70.64% (95% CI 70.28%-71%) and 47.91% (95% CI 47.52-48.31%), respectively (HR 1.07, 95% CI 0.94-1.22). CONCLUSION: For patients over the age of 75 years who underwent SAVR and survived the postoperative period, life expectancy and survival rates were similar to that of the general population.  
Transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis in aortic stenosis: Prevalence, diagnostic challenges, and clinical implications.  ;Transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis (ATTR-CA) is a challenging and underdiagnosed cause of heart failure. Advances in cardiac imaging have enabled noninvasive diagnosis of ATTR-CA, causing the recent upsurge in disease awareness and detection. ATTR-CA has been increasingly recognized in patients with degenerative aortic stenosis (AS). With the growing number of elderly patients undergoing aortic valve intervention, the identification of ATTR-CA in this group of patients is of high clinical importance. Timely and correct diagnosis is essential for amyloid-directed therapies, as well as deciding on the AS treatment strategy. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the recent studies investigating coexistence of these two entities. We present the data on the prevalence of ATTR-CA in AS and their prognostic associations. As the diagnosis of ATTR-CA may be challenging, special attention is paid to the diagnostic utility of different imaging modalities, namely, echocardiography, cardiovascular magnetic resonance, nuclear imaging, and distinctive imaging features, in patients with dual pathology. We also present a flowchart summarizing integrated imaging in patients with suspected ATTR-CA.

Astragaloside IV inhibits cardiac fibrosis via miR-135a-TRPM7-TGF-β/Smads pathway.  ;ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Cardiac fibrosis is a common characteristic of many cardiac diseases. Our previous results showed that TRPM7 channel played an important role in the fibrosis process. MicroRNA-135a was reported to get involved in the fibrotic process. Astragalus membranaceus (Fisch.) Bunge was widely used in Chinese traditional medicine and showed cardiac protective effects in previous researches. Astragaloside IV(ASG), which is regarded as the most important ingredient of Astragalus, has been showed the effect of cardiac protection via various mechanisms, while no data suggested its action related to miRNAs regulation. AIM OF THE STUDY: The objective of this article is to investigate the inhibition effect of ASG on cardiac fibrosis through the miR-135a-TRPM7-TGF-β/Smads pathway. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We extracted the active components from herb according to the paper and measured the content of ASG from the mixture via HPLC. The inhibition potency of cardiac hypertrophy between total extract of Astragalus and ASG was compared. SD rats were treated with ISO (5 mg/kg/day) subcutaneously (s.c.) for 14 days, ASG (10 mg/kg/d) and Astragalus extract (AE) (4.35 g/kg/d, which contained about ASG 10 mg) were given p.o. from the 6th day of the modeling. Cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) of neonatal rats were incubated with ISO (10 μM) and treated with ASG (10 μM) simultaneously for 24 h. RESULTS: The results showed that both AE and ASG treatment reduced the TRPM7 expression from the gene level and inhibited cardiac fibrosis. ASG group showed similar potency as the AE mixture. ASG treatment significantly decreased the current, mRNA and protein expression of TRPM7 which was one of targets of miR-135a. The activation of TGF-β/Smads pathway was suppressed and the expression of α-SMA and Collagen I were also decreased obviously. In addition, our results showed that there was a positive feedback between the activation of TGF-β/Smads pathway and the elevation of TRPM7, both of which could promote the development of myocardial fibrosis. CONCLUSIONS: AE had the effect of cardiac fibrosis inhibition and decreased the mRNA expression of TRPM7. ASG, as one of the effective ingredients of AE, showed the same potency when given the same dose. ASG inhibited cardiac fibrosis by targeting the miR-135a-TRPM7-TGF-β/Smads pathway.

Incidence of cardiovascular events and risk markers in a prospective study of children diagnosed with Marfan syndrome.  ;"BACKGROUND: Little is known about the incidence of cardiovascular events (CVEs) and their associated risk markers in children with Marfan syndrome (MFS). AIMS: To assess the incidence of CVEs and determine risk markers in a cohort diagnosed with Marfan syndrome during childhood and followed for several years. METHODS: From a French multicentre nationwide database, 462 patients with MFS diagnosed during childhood were included prospectively. Patients' files were screened for a period of 20 years (1993-2013). CVEs (e.g. death, aortic dissection, cardiac valve or aortic root surgery) were assessed during the prospective follow-up. RESULTS: Median (interquartile range) age at the end of follow-up was 17.2 (11.1-21.3) years. CVEs were reported for 35 participants (7.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 5.3-10.4%). First CVEs were prophylactic aortic root surgery (n=29), aortic dissection (n=4; two aged <18 years) and death (n=2). Kaplan-Meier cumulative incidence of CVEs was 5.3% (95% CI 3.3-8.7%) during childhood (aged≤18 years) and 19.4% (95% CI 13.3-27.9%) at 25years of age. The cumulative rate of CVEs was higher in case of Valsalva sinus Z-score increase of≥0.1 per year (P=0.0003), maximal Valsalva sinus diameter growth speed ≥5mm per year (P=0.03), aortic regurgitation≥2 (P=0.0005) and maximal Valsalva sinus Z-score≥3 before 16 years of age (P<0.0001). In a multivariable Cox proportional analysis, the Valsalva sinus Z-score remained significantly related to outcome. Considering aortic root evolution, aortic regurgitation, age at diagnosis and beta-blocker therapy were related to Valsalva sinus Z-score evolution during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: CVEs in children with MFS are mainly related to prophylactic aortic root surgery. Aortic dissections are rarely observed in children. The Valsalva sinus Z-score is a strong indicator of subsequent CVEs in children with MFS. Attention to follow-up and beta-blocker observance may be warranted in high-risk children.  "
Aorto-cardiac fistula etiology, presentation, and management: A systematic review.  ;BACKGROUND: Aorto-cardiac fistulae are a rare but increasingly reported entity, and data are scarce. METHOD: The authors performed a systematic review of ACFs to characterize the underlying etiology, clinical presentation, and compare outcomes of treatment strategies. RESULTS: 3,733 publications were identified in the search. Of those, 292 studies including 300 patients were included. Etiology of ACFs was 38% iatrogenic, 25% infectious, 14% traumatic, and 15% due to other causes. Most patients (74%) presented with heart failure. Common locations were aortic-right atrium (37%), and aortic-pulmonary artery (25%). The majority of patients (71%) were treated surgically, while 13% were treated percutaneously, and 16% were treated conservatively. Patients who were managed conservatively had a higher mortality than those treated with invasive closure (53% vs. 12% vs. 3%, p = <0.00001). CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review sheds light on this highly morbid condition. Once recognized, fistula closure appears to be superior to conservative management.

Impact of Baseline Left Ventricular Diastolic Dysfunction in Patients With Severe Aortic Stenosis Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.  ;We sought to assess the impact of diastolic dysfunction (DD) grade, as per the 2016 American Society of Echocardiography/European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging guidelines, on survival of patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) who underwent transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). We included consecutive patients with severe AS who underwent TAVI in our institution. DD grading was determined retrospectively according to the 2016 ASE DD guidelines and categorized to grade I-III and indeterminate grade I-II DD. Comparison of 1-year survival according to DD grade was performed by Kaplan-Meier analysis, and evaluation of DD at 1 year was performed in a subset of patients. Among 606 TAVI patients, 394 (65%) had sufficient data for DD grading. Seventy-seven (20%) had grade I DD, 191 (48%) had grade II, 60 (15%) had grade III, and 66 (17%) had an indeterminate grade between I and II. Baseline characteristics indicate higher rates of atrial fibrillation, brain natriuretic peptide level, pulmonary artery systolic pressure, and indexed left ventricular mass as DD grade increases (all p ≤0.01). In conclusion, comparison of 1-year survival revealed a higher rate of mortality in patients with grade III DD that remained statistically significant following adjustment in a multivariate Cox proportional hazard model. DD grade after TAVI improved in patients with grades II and III. Severe AS patients with grade III DD have higher risk for 1-year mortality after TAVI compared with milder degrees of DD. Further research is warranted to explore a potential benefit for aortic valve therapy at an earlier stage of the disease process.  
Effect on 30-Day Readmissions after Early Versus Delayed Discharge after Uncomplicated Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (from the Nationwide Readmissions Database).  ;"Early discharge after transcatheter aortic valve implantation has been shown to be safe in single-center studies and trials, but outcomes in broader clinical practice are unknown. Using the National Readmission Databases (1/2014 to 9/2015), we compared 30-day readmission rates between early (<3 days) and late (≥3 days) discharges after uncomplicated endovascular TAVR in a propensity-matched cohort. We examined factors associated with failure of early discharge by testing for interactions of patient factors with discharge strategy. Among 4,955 hospitalizations for uncomplicated TAVR, 1,857 (37%) were discharged early with substantial site-level variability (range 0% to 87%; median odds ratio 3.69). In the propensity matched cohort (n = 3,346), there were similar rates of 30-day readmission by discharge strategy (early vs late: 10.3% vs 10.6%; stratified log-rank p = 0.555). There was a statistically significant interaction between discharge strategy and number of chronic conditions (p = 0.007), where readmission rates were lower in patients discharged early in those with 0 to 4 chronic conditions, but not in those with 5 to 10 or >10. In conclusion, in a large ""real-world"" cohort, early discharge after uncomplicated TAVR was not associated with a higher rate of 30-day rehospitalization, yet there was significant variability across US hospitals. No patient characteristics were associated with increased risk of readmission with early discharge.  "
Integration of polarized spatial frequency domain imaging (pSFDI) with a biaxial mechanical testing system for quantification of load-dependent collagen architecture in soft collagenous tissues.  ;Collagen fiber networks provide the structural strength of tissues, such as tendons, skin and arteries. Quantifying the fiber architecture in response to mechanical loads is essential towards a better understanding of the tissue-level mechanical behaviors, especially in assessing disease-driven functional changes. To enable novel investigations into these load-dependent fiber structures, a polarized spatial frequency domain imaging (pSFDI) device was developed and, for the first time, integrated with a biaxial mechanical testing system. The integrated instrument is capable of a wide-field quantification of the fiber orientation and the degree of optical anisotropy (DOA), representing the local degree of fiber alignment. The opto-mechanical instrument''s performance was assessed through uniaxial loading on tendon tissues with known collagen fiber microstructures. Our results revealed that the bulk fiber orientation angle of the tendon tissue changed minimally with loading (median ± 0.5*IQR of 52.7° ± 3.3° and 51.9° ± 3.3° under 0 and 3% longitudinal strains, respectively), whereas on a micro-scale, the fibers became better aligned with the direction of loading: the DOA (mean ± SD) increased from 0.149 ± 0.032 to 0.198 ± 0.056 under 0 and 3% longitudinal strains, respectively, p < 0.001. The integrated instrument was further applied to study two representative mitral valve anterior leaflet (MVAL) tissues subjected to various biaxial loads. The fiber orientations within these representative MVAL tissue specimens demonstrated noticeable heterogeneity, with the local fiber orientations dependent upon the sample, the spatial and transmural locations, and the applied loading. Our results also showed that fibers were generally better aligned under equibiaxial (DOA = 0.089 ± 0.036) and circumferentially-dominant loading (DOA = 0.086 ± 0.037) than under the radially-dominant loading (DOA = 0.077 ± 0.034), indicating circumferential predisposition. These novel findings exemplify a deeper understanding of the load-dependent collagen fiber microstructures obtained through the use of the integrated opto-mechanical instrument. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: In this study, a novel quantitative opto-mechanical system was developed by combining a polarized Spatial Frequency Domain Imaging (pSFDI) device with a biaxial mechanical tester. The integrated system was used to quantify the load-dependent collagen fiber microstructures in representative tendon and mitral valve anterior leaflet (MVAL) tissues. Our results revealed that MVAL's fiber architectures exhibited load-dependent spatial and transmural heterogeneities, suggesting further microstructural complexity than previously reported in heart valve tissues. These novel findings were possible through the system's ability to, for the first time, capture the load-dependent collagen architecture in the mitral valve anterior leaflet tissue over a wide field of view (e.g., 10 × 10 mm for the MVAL tissue specimens). Such capabilities afford unique future opportunities to improve patient outcomes through concurrent mechanical and microstructural assessments of healthy and diseased tissues in conditions such as heart valve regurgitation and calcification.

Intermodality feature fusion combining unenhanced computed tomography and ferumoxytol-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography for patient-specific vascular mapping in renal impairment.  ;"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to establish the feasibility of fusing complementary, high-contrast features from unenhanced computed tomography (CT) and ferumoxytol-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (FE-MRA) for preprocedural vascular mapping in patients with renal impairment. METHODS: In this Institutional Review Board-approved and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant study, 15 consecutive patients underwent both FE-MRA and unenhanced CT scanning, and the complementary high-contrast features from both modalities were fused to form an integrated, multifeature image. Source images from CT and MRA were segmented and registered. To validate the accuracy, precision, and concordance of fused images to source images, unambiguous landmarks, such as wires from implantable medical devices or indwelling catheters, were marked on three-dimensional (3D) models of the respective modalities, followed by rigid co-registration, interactive fusion, and fine adjustment. We then compared the positional offsets using pacing wires or catheters in the source FE-MRA (defined as points of interest [POIs]) and fused images (n = 5 patients, n = 247 points). Points within 3D image space were referenced to the respective modalities: x (right-left), y (anterior-posterior), and z (cranial-caudal). The respective 3D orthogonal reference axes from both image sets were aligned, such that with perfect registration, a given point would have the same (x, y, z) component values in both sets. The 3D offsets (Δx mm, Δy mm, Δz mm) for each of the corresponding POIs represent nonconcordance between the source FE-MRA and fused images. The offsets were compared using concordance correlation coefficients. Interobserver agreement was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficients and Bland-Altman analyses. RESULTS: Thirteen patients (aged 76 ± 12 years; seven female) with aortic valve stenosis and chronic kidney disease and two patients with thoracoabdominal vascular aneurysms and chronic kidney disease underwent FE-MRA for preprocedural vascular assessment, and unenhanced CT examinations were available in all patients. No ferumoxytol-related adverse events occurred. There were 247 matched POIs evaluated on the source FE-MRA and fused images. In patients with implantable medical devices, the mean offsets in spatial position were 0.31 ± 0.51 mm (ρ = 0.99; Cb = 1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.99-0.99) for Δx, 0.27 ± 0.69 mm (ρ = 0.99; Cb = 0.99; 95% CI, 0.99-0.99) for Δy, and 0.20 ± 0.59 mm (ρ = 1; Cb = 1; 95% CI, 0.99-1.00) for Δz. Interobserver agreement was excellent (intraclass correlation coefficient, >0.99). The mean difference in offset between readers was 1.5 mm. CONCLUSIONS: Accurate 3D feature fusion is feasible, combining luminal information from FE-MRA with vessel wall information on unenhanced CT. This framework holds promise for combining the complementary strengths of magnetic resonance imaging and CT to generate information-rich, multifeature composite vascular images while avoiding the respective risks and limitations of both modalities.

Early and late outcomes following aortic root enlargement: A multicenter propensity score-matched cohort analysis.  ;"OBJECTIVE: The safety and efficacy of aortic root enlargement (ARE) at the time of aortic valve replacement (AVR) remains unknown. The objective of this multicenter study was to compare AVR with ARE to AVR for early and late mortality and secondary safety outcomes. METHODS: Clinical and administrative databases in Ontario, Canada, were linked to obtain patients undergoing AVR with or without ARE from 2008 to 2017. Baseline characteristics were compared and 1:1 propensity score matching was performed to account for differences in baseline characteristics. Early outcomes were compared in the matched groups. Late mortality was compared using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and a Cox-proportional hazard model. RESULTS: Sixteen thousand six hundred fifty-six patients undergoing AVR in 11 Ontario institutions were reviewed. Patients who underwent ARE were younger, nonurgent, more likely to be men and had lower rates of hypertension, ischemic heart disease, and congestive heart failure. Propensity score matching yielded similar groups for comparison, with 809 pairs for AVR versus AVR with ARE. There was no difference in 30-day mortality between AVR with ARE versus AVR (2.0% vs 2.1%; P = 1.00). Rates of chest reopening for bleeding, permanent pacemaker implantation, and blood transfusions were similar. Late mortality over 8 years was similar between AVR with ARE and AVR (P = .45). In a sensitivity analysis, results were similar in 525 pairs comparing AVR with coronary artery bypass grafting and ARE to AVR with coronary artery bypass grafting, except that chest reopening for bleeding was higher with AVR with coronary artery bypass grafting and ARE (7.2% vs 3.2%; P = .006). CONCLUSIONS: The addition of ARE to isolated AVR can be safely performed to increase implanted prosthesis size without compromising early mortality. Additional studies with longer follow-up are necessary.  "
Using the Arm for Structural Interventions: Case Selection or Wave of the Future.  ;"The transradial approach has emerged as the preferred alternative to the traditional transfemoral approach owing to the increased evidence of its safety and efficacy. The field of structural heart disease is rapidly evolving; however, periprocedural complications related to access site remain a major determinant of morbidity and mortality. The transradial approach as primary or secondary access site in structural heart interventions like transcatheter aortic valve replacement, balloon aortic valvuloplasty, alternative access, alcohol septal ablations, paravalvular leak, valve snaring, coronary protection, and ventricular septal defect is feasible, safe, with lower vascular complications and high procedural success.

Abdominal aorta tortuosity on computed tomography identifies patients at risk of complications during transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve replacement.  ;"BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement is now indicated in patients at intermediate surgical risk and will probably soon be indicated in patients at low surgical risk, for whom the occurrence of serious procedural complications is not acceptable. AIMS: We aimed to investigate whether simple arterial variables from computed tomography scanning can predict the occurrence of severe early complications in patients undergoing transfemoral TAVR. METHODS: All patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis treated by transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve replacement in our centre, and for whom computed tomography images were available, were included. An exhaustive analysis of preprocedural computed tomography scans was performed retrospectively, in search of arterial tortuosity and vascular calcifications. The primary endpoint was a composite 30-day safety endpoint. RESULTS: Overall, 175 patients were included. The primary endpoint was observed in 60 patients (35%). Abdominal aorta tortuosity was identified in 28 patients (16%) and was strongly associated with the occurrence of a complication (adjusted odds ratio 2.7, 95% confidence interval 1.1-6.6; P=0.03). There was no significant association between iliofemoral tortuosity or vascular calcification and the occurrence of complications. CONCLUSIONS: A tortuous abdominal aorta was found to be a predictor of the occurrence of a complication in patients undergoing transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve replacement. This computed tomography variable should therefore be taken into account when choosing the approach, especially for patients at intermediate and low surgical risk.  "
Long-Term Electrocardiographic Changes and Clinical Outcomes of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation Recipients Without New Postprocedural Conduction Disturbances.  ;"The objective of this study was to determine the long-term (>1 year) electrocardiographic (ECG) and clinical outcomes of patients without significant changes in their electrocardiogram after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI; including patients with pre-existing ECG abnormalities). Among 772 consecutive patients who underwent TAVI in our institution, 397 patients (51%) without new ECG changes were included. TAVI patients were divided into 2 groups according to the presence of pre-existing ECG-conduction disturbances (ECG-CD: 140 patients, non-ECG-CD: 257 patients). Clinical follow-up (median: 35 [22 to 57] months) was complete in all patients but 5 (1.2%), and ECG data were available in 291 patients (84.3% of patients at risk) at a median of 29 (20 to 50) months. In the non-ECG-CD group, most patients (79.8%) remained without significant ECG changes at follow-up, and 16.9% developed first-degree atrioventricular block and/or bundle branch block over time. The rate of permanent pacemaker (PPM) implantation at follow-up was 3.5% (1.1%/year) in the non-ECG-CD group versus 15.7% (5.5%/year) in the ECG-CD group (p <0.001). The presence of pre-existing CD was an independent predictor of PPM at follow-up (hazard ratio [HR] 4.67, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.15 to 10.16, p <0.001). The ECG-CD group exhibited a higher risk of heart failure hospitalization (non-ECG-CD: 25%, ECG-CD: 29%, log-rank p = 0.01), but not mortality (non-ECG-CD: 50%, ECG-CD: 46%, log-rank p = 0.60) at 5-year follow-up. In conclusion, the ECG remained unchanged in most TAVI recipients without new postprocedural CD. Pre-existing ECG-CD was associated with an increased risk of PPM and heart failure hospitalization at long-term follow-up. These results provide reassuring data in the era of TAVI expanding toward candidates with a longer life expectancy, and highlight the importance of a closer follow-up of those patients with pre-existing ECG-CDs.

Severely calcified bicuspid aortic valve stenosis after valve-sparing root replacement: A word of caution.  ;A 58-year-old man was admitted for reoperation for severe aortic stenosis in a previously preserved bicuspid aortic valve (BAV). He had undergone valve-sparing root replacement (VSSR) for dilated aortic root 6 years ago. Transesophageal echocardiography following VSSR showed good valve function with no aortic incompetence. However, the BAV became stenotic causing shortness of breath. At reoperation, the preserved BAV was noted to be fibrotic and calcified and had a fixed rigid small orifice. It was replaced with a biological valve plus root enlargement. Macroscopic finding showed thickening of the cusps and nodular calcification. Microscopic examination revealed severe nodular calcification.  
Efficacy of Combined Cox-Maze IV and Ventricular Septal Myectomy for Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation in Patients With Obstructive Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy.  ;Atrial fibrillation (AF) has important clinical consequences in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HC). Safety and efficacy of the Cox-Maze IV procedure (when combined with ventricular septal myectomy) in patients with obstructive HC and paroxysmal AF is largely unresolved. Records of 395 consecutive HC patients (age 55 ± 13 years) who underwent septal myectomy for heart failure symptoms between 2004 and 2015 were reviewed. Sixty-two patients also had concomitant complete biatrial Cox-Maze IV for a history of symptomatic paroxysmal AF (3.0 ± 3.6 episodes) combined with myectomy comprise the study cohort. Freedom from symptomatic AF recurrences after operation was assessed. Left ventricular outflow gradients were reduced from 81 ± 28 mm Hg preoperatively to 1.2 ± 6.8 mm Hg after operation. At most recent follow-up, 53 patients (85%) were asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic. Freedom from recurrent symptomatic AF after myectomy/Cox-Maze IV was: 85% (95% confidence interval [CI] 73, 92) at 1 year, 69% (95% CI 55, 79) at 3 years, and 64% (95% CI 48, 75) at 5 years, including 34 patients (54%) who have experienced no symptomatic AF episodes for up to 8.2 years following surgery. The only clinical predictor of recurrent AF over follow-up was preoperative transverse left atrial dimension ≥45 mm (p <0.01). In conclusion, biatrial Cox-Maze IV combined with septal myectomy is associated with favorable long-term freedom from symptomatic paroxysmal AF recurrence, as well as from obstructive heart failure symptoms. These data support myectomy/Cox-Maze as an effective management option for the subgroup of HC patients with symptomatic outflow obstruction and paroxysmal AF.  
Sex-specific cardiac phenotype and clinical outcomes in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  ;"BACKGROUND: It is unknown whether sex-specific differences in mortality observed in HCM are due to older age of women at presentation, or whether women have greater degree of LV myopathy than men. METHODS: We retrospectively compared clinical/imaging characteristics and outcomes between women and men in our overall cohort composed of 728 HCM patients, and in an age-matched subgroup comprised of 400 age-matched patients. We examined sex-specific differences in LV myopathy, and dissected the influence of age and sex on outcomes. LV myopathy was assessed by measuring LV mass, LVEF, global peak longitudinal systolic strain (LV-GLS), diastolic function (E/A, E/e'), late gadolinium enhancement (LV-LGE) and myocardial blood flow (MBF) at rest/stress. The primary endpoint was a composite outcome, comprising heart failure (HF), atrial fibrillation (AFib), ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation (VT/VF) and death; individual outcomes were defined as the secondary endpoint. RESULTS: Women in the overall cohort were older by 6 years. Women were more symptomatic and more likely to have obstructive HCM. Women had smaller LV cavity size, stroke volume and LV mass, higher indexed maximum wall thickness (IMWT), more hyperdynamic LVEF and higher/similar LV-GLS. Women had similar LV-LGE and E/A, but higher E/e' and rest/stress MBF. Female sex was independently associated with the composite outcome in the overall cohort, and with HF in the overall cohort and age-matched subgroup after adjusting for obstructive HCM, LA diameter, LV-GLS. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that sex-specific differences in LV geometry, hyper-contractility and diastolic function, not greater degree of LV myopathy, contribute to a higher, age-independent risk of diastolic HF in women with HCM.

Pressure drop mapping using 4D flow MRI in patients with bicuspid aortic valve disease: A novel marker of valvular obstruction.  ;BACKGROUND: The influence of complex bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) flow patterns on net intraluminal aortic pressure, both among patients with and without significant aortic stenosis, is unknown. Pressure drop (PD), as estimated by 4D Flow MRI, can quantify pre- vs post-valvular pressure at multiple levels simultaneously. METHODS: In this prospective clinical study, 32 patients with BAV with varying degrees of aortic stenosis and regurgitation and 11 healthy subjects were enrolled. 4D flow MRI was processed and analyzed at 9 pre-defined thoracic aortic levels. PD was calculated at each plane relative to a reference located within the left ventricular outflow tract. Conventional 2D phase-contrast imaging was used as reference of hemodynamic obstruction. PD was compared between healthy subjects versus BAV patients using Kruskal-Wallis H test and Mann-Whitney U. Correlation studies were conducted using Spearman's rank-order correlation. RESULTS: Both BAV patients and healthy subjects showed progressive elevation in PD from the aortic root to the distal descending thoracic aorta. However, BAV patients showed higher PD than healthy subjects (p ≤ 0.01) at all analysis planes. Patients with moderate-severe aortic stenosis (n = 5) by 2D phase-contrast (peak PG > 40 mm Hg) showed higher PD than those without in the descending aortic segments (p ≤ 0.005). A correlation (r = 0.88, p < 0.05) was observed between PD at the distal descending thoracic aorta and peak trans-valvular velocity measured by 2D phase-contrast MRI. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that PD with 4D flow MRI is clinically feasible in BAV patients and provides an additional physiologic description of valve-related hemodynamic obstruction.

Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Influence on Coronary Hemodynamics: A Quantitative Meta-Analysis and Proposed Decision-Making Algorithm.  ;"BACKGROUND: As transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) expands to younger and lower-risk severe aortic stenosis patients, appropriate coronary artery disease treatment is key to reducing long-term adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Recently, studies have been exploring the role of coronary-physiology guided revascularization strategies. Our aim was to investigate whether TAVR influences coronary physiology measurements using quantitative meta-analytic methods. METHODS: We performed a Medline and Embase search for studies evaluating coronary physiology indices before and after TAVR. Double independent screening and extractions of baseline, procedural, angiographic, and echocardiographic data were performed. Risk of bias was assessed using the ACROBAT-NRSI tool. Pooled mean difference estimates of coronary hemodynamic indices before and after TAVR were derived using random-effects models with the inverse variance method (RevMan, Review Manager, version 5.3.5; Nordic Cochrane Centre). RESULTS: Five studies evaluating 250 coronary vessels in 169 severe aortic stenosis patients were quantitatively synthesized. Coronary flow reserve did not change immediately after TAVR in non-diseased vessels (n = 3; mean difference, 0.11; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.10-0.32; P=.29; I²=0%; P=.68). Importantly, fractional flow reserve also did not vary significantly following TAVR in both non-diseased (n = 3; mean difference, -0.01; 95% CI, -0.04-0.03; P=.75; I²=41; P=.19) and diseased coronaries (n = 3; mean difference, -0.01; 95% CI, -0.03-0.01; P=.49; I²=0%; P=.46). Similarly, instantaneous wave-free ratio remained stable following TAVR (n = 2; mean difference, 0.00; 95% CI, -0.02-0.02; P>.99; I²=0; P>.99. CONCLUSIONS: Pooled coronary physiology measurements before and after TAVR are similar, but data on variation within individual lesions are limited.  "
Buspirone for the Treatment of Generalized Anxiety Disorder in Williams Syndrome: A Case Series.  ;Co-morbid anxiety disorders, including generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), are highly prevalent among individuals with Williams syndrome (WS). However, reports of the pharmacologic treatment of only a limited number of previous anxiety disorders in WS have appeared in the literature. Here, we review the case histories of three adolescents/young adults with WS and the treatment course of co-morbid GAD with buspirone. Treatment with buspirone was well-tolerated and resulted in sustained response in all three cases. Common medical disorders in WS are highlighted with regards to safe and appropriate pharmacologic treatment of GAD. Buspirone's generally benign side effect profile is a major benefit of its use for treating GAD in individuals with WS.  
Incidence and Predictors of Permanent Pacemaker Implantation in Patients Who Underwent Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: Observation of a Chinese Population.  ;"AIMS: Permanent pacemaker (PPM) implantation is one of the most common complications after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). We studied the incidence of PPM implantation and identified the predictors in patients who underwent TAVR in a Chinese population. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 256 patients who underwent TAVR with self-expandable valves were included. The incidence of PPM implantation in our study population was 14.8%. In patients who received PPM implantation, the proportion of bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) patients was much lower compared to tricuspid aortic valve (TAV) patients (18.4 vs. 81.6%, p < 0.05). Patients with BAV were associated with a significantly lower PPM implantation rate and shallower implantation depth compared to patients with TAV (6.4 vs. 21.7% and 4.2 ± 4.4 vs. 6.2 ± 5.0 mm, respectively, p < 0.05 for both). In the multivariable logistic regression analysis, prior right bundle branch block (RBBB; OR 8.3, 95% CI 2.2-32.1, p < 0.05), implantation depth (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1-1.5, p = 0.01), and TAV (OR 4.7, 95% CI 1.5-14.4, p < 0.05) were independent predictors of PPM implantation after TAVR. There was no difference in 30-day and 1-year all-cause mortality between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of PPM implantation in patients with self-expandable valves after TAVR was 14.8% in our cohort study. Independent predictors of PPM implantation included prior RBBB, TAV, and implantation depth at the noncoronary sinus side. TAVR in BAV with a supra-annular structure-based sizing strategy might decrease the risk of PPM implantation.  "
Paradoxical low-flow, low-gradient severe aortic stenosis with mild aortic valve calcification.  ;DOI: 10.4244/EIJ-D-19-00778 PMID: 31719000 [Indexed for MEDLINE]  
Management of Adults With Normally Functioning Congenitally Bicuspid Aortic Valves and Dilated Ascending Aortas.  ;We describe herein a 65-year-old woman who underwent resection of a dilated (5.1 cm) ascending aorta associated with a normally functioning congenitally bicuspid aortic valve. The patient provided the framework to discuss proper management-operative versus nonoperative-of the dilated ascending aorta associated with a normally functioning bicuspid aortic valve. Unfortunately, there is inadequate data to provide an unequivocal answer to this dilemma. Operative intervention requires that the short-term risk of the prophylactic procedure be considerably lower than the long-term risk of aortic dissection/rupture without operative intervention. Because there is no proof that operative intervention provides less morbidity and lower mortality, nonoperative management at this time seems to be the better approach.  
Out-of-Hospital 30-day Deaths After Cardiac Surgery Are Often Underreported.  ;BACKGROUND: Operative mortality (in-hospital during the index admission or within 30 days of the procedure after discharge) is commonly used as a quality of care measure for public reporting of cardiac surgery outcomes, but the ability to capture out-of-hospital deaths accurately remains undetermined. The objective of the study was to estimate the impact of incomplete reporting of out-of-hospital deaths on hospital risk-adjusted mortality and outlier status. METHODS: New York State's 2014 to 2016 cardiac registry data were used to compare the capture of 30-day postprocedure deaths after discharge with and without the use of national and state-level vital statistics data for all 54,442 patients undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass graft, cardiac valve surgery, or both. Hospital risk-adjusted operative mortality rates and mortality outliers were compared based on statistical models that were developed with and without the use of vital statistics data. RESULTS: Thirty-day deaths postprocedure after discharge ranged from 10% to 39% of all operative deaths among cardiac surgical procedures. More than 30% of these deaths were missing without vital statistics confirmation for 7 of the 10 cardiac procedures examined, and more than 40% were missing for 5 of the procedures examined. When vital statistics data were used to confirm 30-day postprocedure deaths after discharge, an additional high outlier for valve surgery was identified. CONCLUSIONS: Operative mortality after cardiac surgery is often underreported owing to a considerable percentage of out-of-hospital cardiac surgery deaths that are missed by reporting centers. This can adversely affect the assessment of hospital risk-adjusted mortality in public reports.

Treatment of Congestive Heart Failure with Intravenous Nitroglycerin in Three Dogs with Degenerative Valvular Disease.  ;We described the use of IV nitroglycerin as adjunctive therapy in three canine patients with left congestive heart failure secondary to degenerative mitral valve disease. All three dogs were admitted for signs of respiratory distress and all were determined to be in left congestive heart failure by history, exam findings, thoracic radiographs, and echocardiography. In addition to standard therapy for left congestive heart failure, IV nitroglycerin was administered as a constant rate infusion at a dose of 1-6 mcg/kg/min. No adverse events attributable to the drug were noted. This is the first reported use of IV nitroglycerin in clinical veterinary patients. Further studies are warranted to investigate the safety, efficacy, and optimal dosing of IV nitroglycerin infusions in dogs with left congestive heart failure.  
Initial experiences with a novel biodegradable device for percutaneous closure of atrial septal defects: From preclinical study to first-in-human experience.  ;"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility, safety, and effectiveness of a novel, absorbable atrial septal defect (ASD) closure device made of poly-l-lactic acid (PLLA) in a swine model of ASD and for the first time in humans. METHODS: A preclinical safety study was conducted using a swine model of ASD. In a clinical setting, five pediatric patients underwent ASD closure with the PLLA device with fluoroscopic and transthoracic echocardiography guidance. The procedural results and clinical outcomes at 1 day, 30 days, 3 months, and 6 months after closure were analyzed. RESULTS: The 24- and 36-month follow-up results of the preclinical study demonstrated that the PLLA device exhibited good endothelialization and degradability in the swine model. In the clinical study, successful device implantation was achieved in all five patients (median age, 3.6 years; range, 3.1-6.5 years). The mean defect size was (13.6 ± 2.7) mm. Follow-up at 30 days, 3 months, and 6 months was completed in all five cases. The complete defect closure rates with no residual shunt at 30 days, 3 months, and 6 months follow-up were 60% (3/5), 80% (4/5), and 80% (4/5), respectively. No device dislodgement, significant aortic valve or mitral valve regurgitation, new onset cardiac arrhythmia, or other adverse events were reported. CONCLUSION: The study results demonstrated that it is feasible to implant the PLLA device for closure of small to medium sized ASDs without significant residual shunts or severe adverse events in humans. The PLLA device exhibited good endothelialization and degradability in the swine model at 24 and 36 months. Further studies to evaluate long-term safety and effectiveness with the device in a large cohort of patients are warranted.  "
Outcome of patients with previous coronary artery bypass grafting and severe calcific aortic stenosis receiving transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve replacement.  ;OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the impact of previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) on early safety at 30 days and 1-year mortality in patients receiving transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). BACKGROUND: The use of TAVR in patients with previous CABG suffering from severe aortic stenosis has increased in the last years. METHODS: Consecutive TAVR patients were stratified according to previous CABG versus no previous cardiac surgery (control). All-cause 1-year mortality and early safety at 30 days were evaluated. RESULTS: In the unmatched cohort and compared to control (n = 2,364), CABG (n = 260) were younger, more often male and suffered more often from comorbidities leading to an increased STS-score (p < .001). The rate of early safety events at 30 days was comparable between CABG and control (21.2% vs. 24.6%, p = .22) with a higher mortality in CABG (9.6% vs. 5.3%, p = .005). All-cause 1-year mortality was higher in CABG compared to controls (HR 1.51 [95%-CI 1.15-1.97], p = .003). Applying Cox regression analysis, both 30-day (HR 1.57 [95%-CI 0.97-2.53], p = .067) and all-cause 1-year mortality (HR 1.24 [95%-CI 0.91-1.70], p = .174) were not significantly different between groups. After propensity-score matching, the rate of early safety events at 30 days was lower in CABG compared to controls (21.6% vs. 31.7%, p = .02). Thirty-day (9.1% vs. 7.7%, p = .596) and all-cause 1-year mortality (24.0% vs. 23.1%, p = .520, HR 1.14 [95%-CI 0.77-1.69], p = .520) were not different between groups. CONCLUSION: In patients receiving TAVR, previous CABG was not associated with an increase in periprocedural complications and all-cause 1-year mortality when adjusted for other comorbidities.  
Three-dimensional Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for Automated Myocardial Scar Quantification in Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy: A Multicenter Multivendor Study.  ;"Background Cardiac MRI late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) scar volume is an important marker for outcome prediction in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM); however, its clinical application is hindered by a lack of measurement standardization. Purpose To develop and evaluate a three-dimensional (3D) convolutional neural network (CNN)-based method for automated LGE scar quantification in patients with HCM. Materials and Methods We retrospectively identified LGE MRI data in a multicenter (n = 7) and multivendor (n = 3) HCM study obtained between November 2001 and November 2011. A deep 3D CNN based on U-Net architecture was used for LGE scar quantification. Independent CNN training and testing data sets were maintained with a 4:1 ratio. Stacks of short-axis MRI slices were split into overlapping substacks that were segmented and then merged into one volume. The 3D CNN per-site and per-vendor performances were evaluated with respect to manual scar quantification performed in a core laboratory setting using Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), Pearson correlation, and Bland-Altman analyses. Furthermore, the performance of 3D CNN was compared with that of two-dimensional (2D) CNN. Results This study included 1073 patients with HCM (733 men; mean age, 49 years ± 17 [standard deviation]). The 3D CNN-based quantification was fast (0.15 second per image) and demonstrated excellent correlation with manual scar volume quantification (r = 0.88, P < .001) and ratio of scar volume to total left ventricle myocardial volume (%LGE) (r = 0.91, P < .001). The 3D CNN-based quantification strongly correlated with manual quantification of scar volume (r = 0.82-0.99, P < .001) and %LGE (r = 0.90-0.97, P < .001) for all sites and vendors. The 3D CNN identified patients with a large scar burden (>15%) with 98% accuracy (202 of 207) (95% confidence interval [CI]: 95%, 99%). When compared with 3D CNN, 2D CNN underestimated scar volume (r = 0.85, P < .001) and %LGE (r = 0.83, P < .001). The DSC of 3D CNN segmentation was comparable among different vendors (P = .07) and higher than that of 2D CNN (DSC, 0.54 ± 0.26 vs 0.48 ± 0.29; P = .02). Conclusion In the hypertrophic cardiomyopathy population, a three-dimensional convolutional neural network enables fast and accurate quantification of myocardial scar volume, outperforms a two-dimensional convolutional neural network, and demonstrates comparable performance across different vendors. © RSNA, 2019 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

Antegrade transcatheter closure of a dehiscence of pulmonary bioprosthesis after pulmonary valve replacement with the Occlutech paravalvular leak device.  ;We report a case of antegrade transcatheter occlusion of a paravalvular leak (PVL) after bioprosthetic pulmonary valve replacement in a 31-year-old patient with tetralogy of Fallot. The leak resulted in severe pulmonary regurgitation with right ventricle volume overload. This case is the first-ever report of a successful percutaneous closure of PVL using the Occlutech paravalvular leak device.  
Transcatheter mitral valve-in-valve implantation: reports of the first 50 cases from a Latin American Centre.  ;"OBJECTIVES: Our goal was to analyse the initial results of the first 50 transapical transcatheter mitral valve-in-valve procedures performed in a single Latin American centre. METHODS: A prospective, single centre, database analysis was conducted to evaluate immediate, 30-day and 1-year postoperative results of 50 consecutive patients who had a transcatheter mitral valve-in-valve procedure from May 2015 to June 2018. All patients were operated on in a hybrid operating room and received a balloon-expandable valve via the transapical approach. Preoperative and postoperative characteristics were analysed and compared between the first 25 and the second 25 patients to evaluate the impact of the learning curve. Twenty patients had a follow-up examination at 1 year. RESULTS: There was a 98% device success rate. The patients had a mean age of 64.8 years; 72% were women; 80% were in New York Heart Association functional class ≥III preoperatively; and 36% of the procedures were urgent. The mean Society of Thoracic Surgeons scores and EuroSCORE II were 8.3% and 12.4%, respectively. Patients had a median of 2 previous operations; valve durability was 12.1 years; and 64% mitral valve disease of rheumatic fever aetiology. Echocardiography showed decreases in the maximum and mean mitral gradients from 23.5 to 14.6 and 11.5 to 6.4 mmHg postoperatively; the overall mean hospitalization period was 15 days. The overall mortality rate at 30 days was 14%, with 1 intraprocedural death. Further subanalyses between the first and the second half of the cases showed a drop in the mortality rate from 20% to 8% (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: The transcatheter mitral valve-in-valve procedure was shown to be a safe and effective procedure to treat bioprosthetic dysfunction, with potential benefits in patients with rheumatic disease.

Pathophysiological and clinical implications of high intramural coronary blood flow velocity in aortic stenosis.  ;We sought to recognize the blood flow velocity (BFV) through the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery and its small intramyocardial (IM) branches by transthoracic Doppler-echocardiography in patients with aortic stenosis (AS). Sixty-two patients, aged 74.0 ± 9.6 years, 37 women, with preserved left ventricular (LV) function, apparently free of active ischemic disease, were enrolled and classified into 3 groups according to the mean gradient (MG) across the aortic valve: 13 patients (21%) entered the group A (MG ≤ 20 mmHg), 29 (48%) group B (MG 21-40 mmHg) and 20 (31%) group C (MG > 40 mmHg). Peak and mean coronary BFVs were demonstrated to gradually increase according to AV gradient, especially through the IM arteries. Peak IM-BFV was 58.9 cm/s (95% CI 46.4-71.4) in group A, 73.2 cm/s (95% CI 64.8-81.6) in group B, and 96.4 cm/s (95% CI 86.3-106.5) in group C (p < 0.001), whereas peak LAD-BFV was 38.1 cm/s (95% CI 32.8-43.3), 44.4 cm/s (95% CI 40.9-47.9) and 47.3 cm/s (95% CI 43.1-52.5), respectively (p = 0.03). Also, 34 patients complaining with unspecific symptoms showed much higher IM-BFV than those who were not. High values were also recognized in patients with LV ejection fraction/velocity ratio (EFVR) ≤ 0.90 (IM-BFV 91 ± 26 cm/s vs. 72 ± 24 cm/s in those with EFVR > 0.90, p = 0.001). In conclusion, AS patients in the present study showed gradually higher coronary BFVs according to AS gradient, especially through the IM vessels, and both peak and mean velocities were discriminating specific patient subsets. Pathophysiological mechanisms and potential clinical implications are discussed.

Comparison of Transcatheter Pulmonic Valve Implantation With Surgical Pulmonic Valve Replacement in Adults (from the National Inpatient Survey Dataset).  ;"There are no large reports of comparative outcomes of transcatheter pulmonic valve implantation (TPVI) and surgical pulmonic valve replacement (SPVR). Prospective studies are unlikely to be feasible in the future also. Thus, we utilized a large adult inpatient database to compare the two with respect to temporal trends, in hospital outcomes and costs. Data from the National Inpatient Sample database from 2003 to 2014 was analyzed to extract patients who underwent TPVI and SPVR using unique ICD 9-CM codes. In-hospital outcomes and charges were then analyzed. All charges were converted to 2018 dollars and a loss of wages analysis was performed using the Bureau of Labor Statistics published median weekly wages. A total of 8,449 and 555 SPVR and TPVI discharges were identified. 5.8% SPVR procedures were done in rural setting versus 1.8% of TPVI. Complications including in-hospital mortality (2.3 vs 0.9%; p = 0.02) were higher in SPVR group. Length of stay was significantly shorter for the TPVI group (1 vs 5 days; p <0.001), which also contributed to lower loss of wages ($1028.57 vs $6042.86; p <0.001) with similar hospital charges. In conclusion, volumes of both TPVI and SPVR are increasing across adult hospitals in the United States, reflecting an overall increase in the adult congenital heart disease population. TPVI offers improved short-term outcomes and decreased loss of wages through shorter recovery time in this real-world database analysis.  "

Integrating continuous monitoring and evaluation of risk-adjusted outcomes in a cardiac surgical program.  ;BACKGROUND: The variable life-adjusted display (VLAD) method shows the difference between predicted and observed outcomes over time. Our study aims to implement routine in-house monitoring of risk-adjusted 30-day mortality and morbidity following cardiac surgery. METHODS: The Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) risk score was calculated for 249 isolated and combined coronary and aortic or mitral valve cases performed during a 6-month period. The nine predicted STS variables were operative mortality, permanent stroke, renal failure (RF), prolonged ventilation, deep sternal wound (DSW) infection, reoperation for any reason, short and long length of stay (LOS), and major morbidity or operative mortality. EuroSCORE II was also calculated for the study population. VLAD plots were generated for each variable indicating whether performance is better or worse than expected on the basis of predicted risk of failure. RESULTS: The mortality plot was fluctuating close to baseline risk. The prolonged ventilation, RF, reoperation, morbidity/mortality, and LOS plots were consistently positive, indicating favorable results. The stroke chart showed an upward trend for most of the period until two incidents toward last month led to a steep descent. The DSW infections plot though, indicated a worse-than-expected performance. The VLAD charts were shared in multidisciplinary meetings and clinicians were able to confront the performance with the population-specific expectancies and respond to adverse trends with further actions. CONCLUSION: Graphical tool monitoring of risk-adjusted 30-day mortality and morbidity following cardiac surgery is feasible and allows detection of underperformance and implementation of changes in clinical practice.  
Minimally invasive treatment of multiple valve disease: A modified approach through a right lateral minithoracotomy.  ;BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE STUDY: Today there is little experience with minimally invasive treatment of multiple valve disease and no standard techniques have been provided yet. We report our early experience with combined aortic and mitral valve surgery with or without tricuspid surgery through a right lateral minithoracotomy (RmT), describing the technical aspects of our approach. METHODS: From April 2017 to April 2019 thirty patients with mitro-aortic valve disease or with triple valve pathology underwent surgery through a 3 to 4 cm lateral RmT into the third intercostal space. Cardiopulmonary bypass was established through femoral vessels cannulation. Surgery on the mitral valve (MV) was performed first and sutures put into the mitral annulus. Aortic valve replacement (AVR) was performed next. Then, the selected ring or prosthetic valve was implanted in a mitral position throughout previously placed sutures. Finally, if required, tricuspid valve surgery was performed. RESULTS: In combined with AVR, MV replacement was performed in 20 patients (66%), and MV repair in 10 patients (34%). Concomitant tricuspid annuloplasty was performed in five patients (17%). There was no conversion to full sternotomy. Postoperatively, one patient died. Postoperative echocardiography showed no perivalvular leakage in aortic or in the mitral position. No residual mitral regurgitation was observed in patients who underwent MV repair. CONCLUSIONS: Minimally invasive surgery of double and triple valve disease is feasible. Our approach through a lateral RmT allows optimal visualization of the aortic, mitral, and tricuspid valves, simplifies the surgical procedure and allows excellent results also in complex MV repair procedures.  
Predominant Involvement of the Aortic Root in a Patient with Anti-neutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibody-associated Vasculitis: Congestive Heart Failure due to Subacute Severe Aortic Regurgitation and Reversible Conduction Disturbance.  ;A 72-year-old woman was referred to our institution with decompensated congestive heart failure owing to subacute severe aortic regurgitation and mitral regurgitation. Her blood sample tested positive for myeloperoxidase anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA). Cardiac computed tomography revealed abnormal thickening and shortening of the aortic valvar leaflets as well as wall thickening of the sinuses of Valsalva. Based on the diagnosis of ANCA-associated vasculitis, predominantly involving the aortic root, prednisolone administration was initiated, which failed to improve the valvar dysfunction. The patient underwent aortic root replacement and mitral annuloplasty. Histopathology confirmed severe inflammation involving both the aortic valvar sinuses and leaflets.

Impact of posteromedial papillary muscle infarction on mitral regurgitation during ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction.  ;The exact role of papillary muscle infarction (PMI) during the acute phase of acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is not well understood, as existing data on the impact of PMI location is conflicting. We hypothesized that infarction of the posteromedial papillary muscle (PM-PMI) as determined by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging might be associated with an increased incidence of mitral valve regurgitation in the first week after STEMI. 242 patients with first STEMI underwent a late-enhancement (LGE-) cardiac magnetic resonance imaging within a median of 2 (IQR 2-5) days and echocardiography within 3 (IQR 2-5) days after primary angioplasty for the index event. PMI was scored based on short axis slices (AL-PMI: anterolateral PMI, PM-PMI, AL/PM-PMI: AL- and PM-PMI). Patients with PM-PMI had significantly higher odds (OR 2.62, p < 0.01) for the occurrence of mitral regurgitation than patients with no-PMI, AL-PMI or AL/PM-PMI. Furthermore, advanced age, non-anterior infarct location and longer pain-to-balloon time were identified as risk factors for the occurrence of mitral regurgitation. Binary logistic regression analysis revealed that PM-PMI is a predictor of mitral regurgitation independent of infarct location and age (OR 2.229, CI 1.078-4.903, p = 0.031). PM-PMI as determined by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is an independent predictor of mitral regurgitation in the setting of acute STEMI. Our data might improve our understanding of the dynamic nature of functional mitral regurgitation.  
Utility of Pulmonary Artery Acceleration Time to Estimate Systolic Pulmonary Artery Pressure in Neonates and Young Infants.  ;"Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) is commonly used to screen for pulmonary hypertension (PHTN) in neonates and young infants. However, in the absence of sufficient tricuspid regurgitation (TR), a ventricular septal defect (VSD), or a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), the estimation of systolic pulmonary artery pressure (SPAP) becomes challenging. Pulmonary artery acceleration time (PAAT) is an alternate parameter that is easy to obtain in almost all patients and does not require the presence of tricuspid valvar regurgitation or an anatomical cardiac defect. We sought to examine the correlation of PAAT with estimated SPAP by TTE and create an equation to estimate the SPAP using PAAT. We performed a retrospective review of TTEs performed on neonates and young infants (4 months of age or younger) at our institution between April 2017 and December 2018, along with the corresponding medical records. We included TTEs that provided estimation for SPAP and at least one PAAT measurement. During the study period, 138 TTEs performed on 82 patients met the inclusion criteria. Strong correlation was delineated between PAAT and SPAP estimated by the maximum velocity of tricuspid valve regurgitation Doppler, correlation coefficient (r) = - 0.83. Moderate correlation was detected between PAAT and SPAP estimated by PDA Doppler, r = - 0.66. Utilizing the following equation ""SPAP = 82.6 - 0.58 × PAAT + RA mean pressure"", PAAT can be used to estimate SPAP in neonates and young infants. PAAT can be used as an alternative to TR jet to assess SPAP when the latter is absent or insufficient. Further studies are needed to verify the accuracy of this equation.  "
Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in Patients with Coronary Chronic Total Occlusion.  ;INTRODUCTION: Coronary artery disease is a common diagnosis among patients evaluated for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). It is unknown whether the presence of coronary artery chronic total occlusion (CTO) has any impact on TAVR post-procedural in-hospital outcomes. METHODS: The study population was extracted from the 2016 Nationwide Readmissions Data using International Classification of Diseases, tenth edition, clinical modifications/procedure coding system codes for TAVR, coronary CTO and post-procedural complications. Study endpoints included in-hospital all-cause mortality, length of index hospital stay, paravalvular leak (PVL), mechanical complications of prosthetic valve, cardiogenic shock, acute myocardial infarction (AMI), acute kidney injury (AKI), need for a permanent pacemaker, and bleeding. Propensity matching was used to extract a matched control (TAVR-M group to TAVR-CTO group). RESULTS: There were 23,604 TAVR, of whom, 467 discharges were identified in each group. Baseline characteristics and comorbidities were comparable. Mean age was 80.5 years and 45.9% were female. In comparison to TAVR-M, TAVR-CTO was associated with longer length of stay (8.1 versus 5.9 days, p < 0.01), and higher incidence of post-procedural cardiogenic shock (5.1% versus 1.7%, p < 0.01), AMI (5.8% versus 2.8%, p = 0.02), and AKI (18.6% versus 13.9, p = 0.048). There was no significant difference between the two groups in in-hospital all-cause mortality (1.7% versus 2.4%, p = 0.49), PVL (1.3% versus 0.4%, p = 0.16), mechanical complications of prosthetic valve (0.4% versus 0.9%, p = 0.41), permanent pacemaker (11.6% versus 8.1%, p = 0.07), or bleeding (20.6% versus 19.7%, p = 0.74). CONCLUSIONS: In comparison to TAVR-M, TAVR-CTO was associated with a higher incidence of cardiogenic shock, AMI, and AKI and longer LOS but similar mortality.

Bicuspid aortic valve repair with hemi-remodeling technique and external ring annuloplasty.  ;BACKGROUND: Current guidelines recommend root replacement when diameter of the sinuses of Valsalva are superior to 45 mm particularly for bicuspid valve. However, in case of tubular aorta aneurysms with moderate root dilatation (40-45 mm diameter), the approach is still debated regarding the increased risk of coronary reimplantation. We present a modified hemi-remodeling aortic repair technique that includes the replacement of the noncoronary sinus, ascending aorta, and valve repair with external ring annuloplasty in patients with bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) and moderately dilated aortic root. METHODS: Between 2003 and 2017, 18 patients presenting with left-right BAV and an aortic root diameter at 42.3+/-3.3 mm underwent hemi-root and ascending aorta replacement and aortic valve repair with external annuloplasty. RESULTS: Postoperatively, 16 (88.9%) had no aortic insufficiency (AI) and 2 (11.1%) had grade I AI, no patients had grade III or grade IV AI. Overall survival and freedom from grade II AI at 4 years and freedom from aortic valve-related reoperation were 100%. CONCLUSION: The standardized modified hemi-remodeling technique we present is a safe and reproducible procedure, with satisfactory durability at follow-up. This technique represents an interesting alternative to full valve sparing root replacement, as it avoids the operative risk of coronary reimplantation, allows shorter cross-clamping time and a better exposition on the valve for a symmetrical repair, placing the commissure at 180°, compared with valve sparing root replacement.  
Changes in the socioeconomic status of patients receiving TAVR in New York State.  ;BACKGROUND: When transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) was first approved by the Food and Drug Administration in October 2011, it was an innovative treatment with limited accessibility. However, over the past few years, TAVR has become standard of care in patients with aortic stenosis. The effect of socioeconomic status (SES) on this transition of use of TAVR is unknown. METHOD: Using the New York state department Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System database, we compared baseline patient characteristics and facilities in low-income areas and high-income areas. Trends in residential SES of patients undergoing TAVR were examined over time and assessed with a Poisson regression and Cochran Armitage trend tests. RESULT: From October 2011 and 2012 to December 2016, we found that the numbers of TAVR procedures performed among patients from both low (187-1150 in 2016, P < .001) and high (227-1160, P < .001) income areas increased over time. The proportion of TAVR procedures performed in patients from low-income areas increased over time, while those in high-income areas decreased (from 45.2% in 2011 and 2012 to 49.8% in 2016 for low-income and from 54.8%-50.2% for high-income, P = .009). CONCLUSION: In the case of TAVR in New York State, when the innovative treatment was introduced in the clinical practice, there were initial SES-based disparities in access to the procedure. However, these disparities resolved over time, probably due to the broader diffusion of the technique.  
Understanding Number Line Estimation in Williams Syndrome and Down Syndrome.  ;Previous studies suggest that tasks dependent on the mental number line may be difficult for Williams Syndrome (WS) and Down Syndrome (DS) groups. However, few have directly assessed number line estimation in these groups. The current study assessed 28 WS, 25 DS and 25 typically developing (TD) participants in non-verbal intelligence, number familiarity, visuo-spatial skills and number line estimation. Group comparisons indicated no differences in number line estimation. However, the WS group displayed difficulties with visuo-spatial skills and the DS group displayed difficulties with number familiarity. Differential relationships between number line estimation and visuo-spatial/number familiarity skills were observed across groups. Data is discussed in the context of assessment of skills in neurodevelopmental disorders.

Tele-rehabilitation and hospital-based cardiac rehabilitation are comparable in increasing patient activation and health literacy: A pilot study.  ;"BACKGROUND: Cardiac tele-rehabilitation is defined as using information and communication technology to support rehabilitation services. However, it requires a high level of patient activation and health literacy; this has not yet been explored. AIMS: The purpose of this study was to evaluate patient activation and health literacy in tele-rehabilitation compared to hospital-based cardiac rehabilitation. METHODS: We conducted a pilot study in patients with ischaemic or heart valve disease. In a non-randomised design, 24 patients attended a 12-week tele-rehabilitation programme, and 53 matched controls a 12-week hospital-based cardiac rehabilitation programme. The primary outcome was patient activation, which was assessed using the Patient Activation Measure before the intervention, at the end of the intervention and at follow-up six months after the intervention. The secondary outcome was health literacy, assessed using three dimensions from the Health Literacy Questionnaire before rehabilitation and at six-month follow-up: actively manage my health (HLQ3), ability to engage with healthcare providers (HLQ6) and understanding health information (HLQ9). RESULTS: Patient activation improved similarly in tele-rehabilitation and hospital-based cardiac rehabilitation at all time points. Six months after the intervention, patients in tele-rehabilitation significantly improved on the dimension HLQ6 compared to patients in hospital-based cardiac rehabilitation. No significant between-group differences were found in HLQ3 or HLQ9. CONCLUSION: Tele-rehabilitation and hospital-based cardiac rehabilitation seemed to be equally successful in improving patient activation and health literacy. Tele-rehabilitation should be further tested in a randomised controlled trial, with a focus on whether patient levels of education and self-management at the initiation of rehabilitation are decisive factors for tele-rehabilitation participation.

TAVR for mixed aortic valve disease - A good companionship?  ;DOI: 10.1016/j.ijcard.2019.09.031 PMID: 31699455  
Exposure to Ionizing Radiation in Patients Undergoing Transfemoral Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.  ;Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is currently becoming an alternative to surgical valve replacement for patients at low risk, a population that is likely to experience an increase in the radiation-induced cancer risk following TAVI. We aimed to evaluate the overall exposure to ionizing radiation in patients who underwent transfemoral TAVI, including the procedure itself as well as the procedures performed in the preintervention work-up and the post-TAVI interventions. All patients who underwent transfemoral TAVI for symptomatic aortic stenosis in our center over a 26 months period were included. Dosimetric indicators from preprocedural coronary angiography and computed tomography (CT), the TAVI procedure, and any postprocedural interventions (electrophysiology study and/or pacemaker implantation) were collected and converted into an effective dose. A total of 119 transfemoral TAVI procedures were included. The mean cumulative effective dose (ED) was 37.3 mSv. Three irradiating procedures were necessary for 84 patients (71% of the population, i.e., coronary angiography, CT scan and the TAVI procedure itself), whereas 30 patients (25%) required a fourth procedure, and 5 required a fifth (4%). The majority of the dose was from the CT, while only 11% of the dose derived from the TAVI procedure itself. In conclusion, overall exposure to ionizing radiation for patients who underwent transfemoral TAVI seems acceptable, and the majority of the overall ED comes from the CT scan.  
Outcomes After Left Ventricular Outflow Tract Reconstruction With a Tube Graft for Annular Erosion.  ;BACKGROUND: Aortic annular erosion is a serious complication of aortic valve endocarditis or previous aortic valve replacement. This study examined the outcomes of a technique for left ventricular outflow tract reconstruction using a polyester tube graft, followed by translocation of the aortic valve and coronary arteries. METHODS: A total of 23 patients with extensive annular erosion resulting from endocarditis or previous aortic valve replacement with or without pseudoaneurysm formation, or occurring after excision of the native valve, underwent suture of a polyester tube graft in the left ventricular outflow tract below the annulus, replacement of the aortic valve and proximal ascending aorta with a composite graft, and reimplantation of the coronary arteries with the use of interposition polyester grafts. The mean age of the patients was 50 years, and 57% were men. RESULTS: There were no hospital deaths. The mean duration of follow-up was 6.5 years and extended to 16 years. Actuarial survival at 1, 5, and 10 years was 86.7%, 82.2%, and 62.6%, respectively. Two patients required reoperation for a graft-graft pseudoaneurysm and for degeneration of a porcine bioprosthesis. Echocardiograms obtained at a mean of 75 months postoperatively in 15 of the 23 patients demonstrated normal left ventricular outflow tract dimensions and velocities and a mean effective valve orifice area of 1.07 cm2/m2. All coronary artery grafts were patent on angiography a mean of 40 months postoperatively in 13 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Extended experience with this technique confirms its safety and effectiveness for patients with extensive destruction of the aortic annulus. It represents a suitable alternative to other currently used techniques.  
Increased risk of mortality and readmission associated with lower SF-12 scores in cardiac patients: Results from the national DenHeart study.  ;"BACKGROUND: The SF-12v2 health survey (SF-12) is widely used as a generic measure of health-related quality of life. However, interpretation of score differences can be difficult. AIM: To estimate benchmarks for interpretation of score differences on the SF-12 for readmission and all-cause mortality in cardiac patients. METHODS: Data from the DenHeart study, a national cross-sectional survey including one year follow-up register data, were used. Patients with ischaemic heart disease, arrhythmia, heart failure and heart valve disease answered the survey at hospital discharge. Cox proportional hazards models were used to regress readmission and all-cause mortality. RESULTS: A total of 10,813 cardiac patients completed the SF-12. For patients with ischaemic heart disease and arrhythmia, a one point lower physical component summary score was associated with a 2% increase in risk in readmission (hazard ratio (HR) 1.022 (95% confidence interval 1.017;1.027) and HR 1.024 (1.018; 1.029), respectively) and a 3% increase in risk for patients with heart failure (HR 1.027 (1.015; 1.038)). A one point lower mental component summary score was associated with a 2% increase in the risk of readmission (HR 1.017 (1.013; 1.022)) across diagnoses. For both the physical and mental component summary score, a one point lower score meant a 5% increase in the risk of all-cause mortality (HR 1.046 (1.031; 1.060) and HR 1.046 (1.029; 1.065), respectively) across diagnoses. CONCLUSION: In a large group of cardiac patients, a one point lower physical or mental component summary score was associated with an up to 3% increased risk of readmission and a 5% increased risk of mortality in the first year after discharge.

"""Between a rock and the mitral valve space"": Transcatheter mitral valve-in-valve implantation for paravalvular leak and refractory hemolysis complicated by circumflex coronary occlusion.  ";Transcatheter mitral valve implantation (TMVI) is an emerging field in structural cardiology. A particularly difficult group to treat is high-risk patients requiring valve in mitral annular calcification (ViMAC) intervention, with overall poor procedural success and outcomes in recent registries. This case highlights an unusual complication of paravalvular regurgitation (PVL) through the uncovered stent frame of a balloon expandable transcatheter heart valve (THV) on the left ventricular side of the prosthesis, leading to mechanical hemolysis and subsequent anuric renal failure post a ViMAC procedure. Attempts to treat the PVL with an occlusion plug device were unsuccessful and led to left circumflex coronary occlusion secondary to mechanical compression of the vessel in the posterior mitral valve annulus, a previously unreported phenomenon. A repeat valve-in-valve procedure was performed to treat the PVL, and immediate angioplasty resolved the left circumflex occlusion. High-risk patients requiring TMVI pose multiple challenges to Heart Teams in the treatment of valve pathology. Optimal procedural planning, multimodality imaging, improved THVs, and the awareness of potential complications are fundamental in overcoming the learning curve of TMVI and improved outcome for patients requiring ViMAC.  
Hybrid transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement with a SAPIEN S3 valve after pulmonary artery banding via left lateral thoracotomy.  ;For many patients with repaired congenital heart disease, the need for reintervention on dysfunctional right ventricular outflow tracts is pervasive. Many such patients are poor candidates for both transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement and cardiopulmonary bypass, and hybrid surgical and transcatheter procedures have evolved to meet this need. We present two cases of hybrid pulmonary valve replacement involving pulmonary artery band placement via left anterior thoracotomy followed by transvenous placement of a SAPIEN S3 valve without prestenting. This approach avoids cardiopulmonary bypass as well as redo sternotomy and will likely see an increase in utilization in the future.  
Clinical outcomes of mitral valve intervention in patients with mitral annular calcification: A systematic review and meta-analysis.  ;"BACKGROUND: Mitral valve (MV) disease with mitral annular calcification (MAC) poses a surgical challenge and the clinical outcomes of MV surgery as well as transcatheter mitral valve replacement (TMVR) remain relatively unexplored. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the effects of MAC on clinical outcomes following MV surgery and TMVR. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE databases until February 2019 for studies comparing clinical outcomes of MV surgery or TMVR in patients with and without MAC. Data were extracted by two independent investigators. Outcomes were perioperative and midterm complications and mortality. RESULTS: Seven observational studies enrolling 2902 patients were included. MAC patients were older, more likely to be female with greater chronic lung disease and kidney failure. Perioperative mortality was similar between patients with and without MAC undergoing MV surgery (risk ratio [RR], 1.15; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.50-2.65; P = .74). MAC was associated with a higher risk of bleeding, permanent pacemaker implantation, and periprosthetic leak. Midterm mortality was greater in MAC patients undergoing MV surgery (incident rate ratio [IRR], 1.32; 95% CI, 1.05-1.67; P = .02). MAC patients undergoing TMVR had higher perioperative (RR, 4.65; 95% CI, 2.93-7.38; P < .01) and 1-year (RR, 5.44; 95% CI, 3.49-8.49; P < .01) mortality, decreased procedural success, greater left ventricular outflow tract obstruction and need for conversion to surgery when compared with patients undergoing TMVR for dysfunction of a bioprosthetic valve or annuloplasty ring. CONCLUSION: MV procedures in patients with MAC are associated with higher mortality and morbidity. This is largely driven by the high-risk patient profile associated with MAC. TMVR holds promise but has important limitations and should be reserved for select patients.  "
Early and midterm outcomes of a modified single-patch technique for repairing complete atrioventricular septal defect in children and adults.  ;"OBJECTIVES: The ""modified single-patch"" technique (Nunn's technique) has become more widely adopted, especially in small infants with common atrioventricular septal defect (CAVSD). In this study, we retrospectively reviewed our surgical experiences of the ""modified single-patch"" technique with CAVSD patients, including newborns and adults, to reveal the early and midterm clinical results. METHODS: There were 233 cases diagnosed with CAVSD undergoing biventricular repair in our hospital from June 2009 to 2016. A total of 197 cases (84.5%) with the ""modified single-patch"" technique were enrolled in the final analysis, including type A in 106 cases (53.8%), type B in 13 cases (6.6%), type C in 15 cases (7.6%), and intermediate type in 63 cases (32%). Major associated cardiovascular malformations included five cases of unroofed coronary sinus syndrome with LSVC (UCS), five cases of coarctation of the aorta and one case of translocation of the great artery. The median age at operation of the studied 197 cases was 44.3 ± 103.3 months (ranging from 18 days to 58 years old), including two newborns. Detailed information on the ""modified single-patch"" procedure was described previously, and the other cardiac malformations were repaired simultaneously with surgical repair. RESULTS: There were 14 (7.1%) early deaths and 3 (1.5%) late deaths at 3 months and 1 year after the initial operation, respectively. The total mortality rate was 8.1%, and there was no significant difference in mortality among the different age groups (P = .291). Five patients (2.5%) underwent reoperation because of severe mitral insufficiency (MI), and another patient was reoperated for left ventricular outflow tract obstruction 3 years after the initial surgery. Long-term survival in the <3 months group was significantly lower than that in the group of older children (1-18 years old). Of the 180 survivors who were followed up for at least 1 year, the proportion of severe MI began to drop from 26.2% before the operation to 13.8% just 1-week postoperation and continued to decline to the lowest level, 3.4%, at 3 months postoperation. However, MI began to rebound at 3 months and reached 20.8% at 1-year postoperation. The rebound of MI was evident in the (3 months, 6 months) age group and the >18 years age group. However, compared to the preoperation situation, the proportion of severe tricuspid insufficiencies decreased each month from 24.8% to 0.0% until 3 months after the operation and remained at a relatively low level within 1 year after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, age is not a limitation of the modified single-patch technique, and patients even in adults with surgical indications can apply this technique. In older children and adults, we should pay more attention to atrioventricular valve annuloplasty. Infants may suffer from severe residual left atrioventricular valve regurgitation, especially in the <3 months age group, so we should improve postoperative follow-up work during infancy.  "
Incidence, 30-day readmission rates and predictors of readmission after new onset atrial fibrillation who underwent transcatheter aortic valve replacement.  ;"INTRODUCTION: New onset Atrial Fibrillation (NOAF) is frequently seen post transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). NOAF in the setting of TAVR has also been recognized as predictor of worse outcomes, including higher readmission rates. Data assessing the effect and predictors of NOAF on 30-day readmission rates post TAVR is limited. OBJECTIVE: To assess the incidence, 30-day readmission rate and predictors of NOAF in patients who underwent TAVR. METHODS: Nationwide Readmissions Database was used to identify patients who developed NOAF post-TAVR between 2012 and 2015. RESULTS: A total of 24,076 patients were included in this study, of which 54% were males, and the mean age was 82.4 ± 7.2. NOAF was developed in 10,847 (45%) patients. Overall readmission rates with NOAF was 19.7% and trend in the readmissions reduced during the course of the study (21.9% to 18.7%, Ptrend < 0.001). Thirty-day readmission rate in patients who developed NOAF post-TAVR was significantly higher compared to TAVR patients without NOAF (OR 1.39; 95% CI, 1.28-1.51; p < 0.001). Similarly, rate of ischemic stroke was significantly higher among patients who developed NOAF (OR 1.22; 95% CI, 1.07-1.4; p = 0.004). Predictors of readmissions in NOAF group were mostly non-cardiac, and included age, and comorbidities with chronic liver disease, renal failure and chronic lung disease been the most common comorbidities, in that order. CONCLUSIONS: Incidence of NOAF is associated with increased risk of readmissions and ischemic stroke. Future research should focus on interventions to prevent avoidable readmissions and associated morbidity and mortality.  "

Comparison of the geometry of the left ventricle outflow tract, the aortic root and the ascending aorta in patients with severe tricuspid aortic stenosis versus healthy controls.  ;The purpose of this study was to assess by multislice computed tomography (MSCT) imaging geometry of the ascending aorta, the aortic root, the aortic annulus and the left ventricle outflow tract (LVOT) in aortic stenosis (AS) patients, to compare aortic root morphology in patients with AS with healthy controls and to evaluate sex differences. Fifty patients with severe AS and 50 age- and gender-matched controls who underwent MSCT were included in the study. The dimensions of the LVOT, the aortic annulus, the aortic root, the ascending aorta, and the volume of the aortic root were retrospectively assessed and a comparison was made between patients with severe tricuspid AS and controls. Patients with tricuspid AS in comparison with controls had smaller dimensions of the sinus of Valsalva resulting in reduction of the aortic root volume, whereas the dimensions of the other structures were comparable. MSCT revealed larger annular, LVOT and the sinus of Valsalva dimensions and the aortic root volume in men than women. Men with AS differed from healthy men only in regard to the dimensions of the sinus of Valsalva, while women showed significant differences also in the LVOT, and the aortic annulus. MSCT showed accurately aortic root remodeling in tricuspid AS patients and indentified sex-dependent differences. Women with tricuspid AS differ from healthy women more than men did. A high degree of the variability in the aortic root dimensions requires further careful research.  
Heart failure as interstitial cancer: emergence of a malignant fibroblast phenotype.  ;A prolonged state of left ventricular pressure overload, commonly caused by hypertension and aortic valve disease, promotes remodelling of the myocardium that can progress to heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). In animal models, a major factor driving progression from pressure-overload hypertrophy (POH) to HFpEF is the activation and proliferation of an abnormal fibroblast phenotype that is resistant to apoptosis, degrades normal stromal matrix and is replaced with a fibrotic matrix structure. A similar fibroblast phenotype has been identified in the stroma of solid cancers. This cancer-associated fibroblast drives tumour growth and invasion. The proliferation and expansion of these abnormal fibroblast populations in both HFpEF and cancer contribute to progression of disease. In early-phase clinical trials, chemotherapeutic agents targeting cancer-associated fibroblasts had antitumour properties. In this Perspectives article, we postulate that, because the abnormal fibroblast populations in POH and cancer have identical characteristics, chemotherapeutic agents targeting the POH-related fibroblast might attenuate the development of myocardial fibrosis, a pathophysiological hallmark of HFpEF. These agents must be designed to target the abnormal fibroblasts with high specificity because many classes of chemotherapeutic drugs can themselves cause myocardial dysfunction and heart failure.  
Significantly increased risk of all-cause mortality among cardiac patients feeling lonely.  ;OBJECTIVE: To explore whether living alone and loneliness 1) are associated with poor patient-reported outcomes at hospital discharge and 2) predict cardiac events and mortality 1 year after hospital discharge in women and men with ischaemic heart disease, arrhythmia, heart failure or heart valve disease. METHODS: A national cross-sectional survey including patients with known cardiac disease at hospital discharge combined with national register data at baseline and 1-year follow-up. Loneliness was evaluated using one self-reported question, and information on cohabitation was available from national registers. Patient-reported outcomes were Short Form-12, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and HeartQoL. Clinical outcomes were 1-year cardiac events (myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiac arrest, ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation) and all-cause mortality from national registers. RESULTS: A total of 13 443 patients (53%) with ischaemic heart disease, arrhythmia, heart failure or heart valve disease completed the survey. Of these, 70% were male, and mean age was 66.1 among women and 64.9 among men. Across cardiac diagnoses, loneliness was associated with significantly poorer patient-reported outcomes in men and women. Loneliness predicted all-cause mortality among women and men (HR 2.92 (95% CI 1.55 to 5.49) and HR 2.14 (95% CI 1.43 to 3.22), respectively). Living alone predicted cardiac events in men only (HR 1.39 (95% CI 1.05 to 1.85)). CONCLUSIONS: A strong association between loneliness and poor patient-reported outcomes and 1-year mortality was found in both men and women across cardiac diagnoses. The results suggest that loneliness should be a priority for public health initiatives, and should also be included in clinical risk assessment in cardiac patients.  
Comparison of tissue tracking assessment by cardiovascular magnetic resonance for cardiac amyloidosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  ;BACKGROUND: Administration of gadolinium-contrast can cause problems in cardiac amyloidosis (CA) patients with impaired renal function. PURPOSE: To compare patterns of cardiovascular magnetic resonance tissue tracking (CMR-TT) for CA and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and to assess the feasibility of CMR-TT to distinguish between these diseases without administration of gadolinium-contrast. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Included were 54 patients with biopsy-proven CA, 40 patients with HCM, and 30 healthy people. We calculated strain ratio of apex to base (SRAB) in the left ventricle (LV) using radial (R), circumferential (C), and longitudinal (L) strain from CMR-TT. The LV ejection fraction (LVEF) and the ratio of septal to posterior wall at basal level were also calculated. Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) image analysis was performed for differential diagnosis. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) comparisons were used. RESULTS: All SRAB values were significantly different between CA and HCM (all P < 0.001). AUC values for parameters were 0.806 for LVEF, 0.815 for ratio of wall thickness, 0.944 for the LGE pattern, 0.898 for SRABR, 0.880 for SRABC, and 0.805 for SRABL. AUCs for the LGE pattern were significantly higher than for LVEF, ratio of wall thickness and SRABL (all P < 0.008). No significant differences were seen between AUCs for the LGE pattern, SRABR, and SRABC (all P > 0.109). CONCLUSION: SRABR and SRABC were reliable parameters for distinguishing between CA and HCM.  
Off-Pump Tricuspid Annuloplasty through a Direct Transatrial Approach: Early Results.  ;Severe tricuspid regurgitation constitutes a growing disease burden. Conventional surgery for tricuspid valve disease has an increased risk while several interventional procedures are currently under clinical investigation, yet do not offer comprehensive solutions. We investigated a novel surgical approach for off-pump beating-heart tricuspid annuloplasty in circulating blood through a single port in the right atrium. Early feasibility results in preclinical porcine in vivo studies encourage further development of this approach, combining the proven concept of surgical annuloplasty with the benefits of minimally invasive off-pump procedures in a hybrid setting.

Commissure enhancement technique in aortic valve repair.  ;Sinotubular junction enlargement is one of possible causes of aortic valve regurgitation. However, there is no appropriate technique for sinotubular junction diameter reduction in aortic valve repair in a patient without disease of the ascending aorta or sinus of Valsalva. Herein, we report a simple commissure enhancement technique comprising the placement a horizontal mattress suture buttressed with felt at the sinotubular junction level in the commissure area. This technique results in the relocation of the commissure to the inner side, and a reduction in the diameter of the sinotubular junction.  
Fractional flow reserve in patients with coronary artery disease undergoing TAVI: a prospective analysis.  ;"OBJECTIVES: To determine the true prevalence of CAD in AS patients, to detect changes of the hemodynamic significance of coronary lesions following TAVI, to explore to what extent FFR-positive CAD might influence outcome and finally to develop a management algorithm for this patient subset. METHODS: From May 2016 to March 2018, diagnostic coronary angiography was performed in 246 patients before TAVI. In the presence of coronary lesions with a diameter stenosis ≥ 50%, FFR was measured. In patients with positive FFR ≤ 0.80, a control angiography was performed 6-8 weeks after TAVI. RESULTS: The study cohort was 81.0 ± 6.1 years old, 48.4% of the patients were male. 53.3% had concomitant CAD. 35.9% of these patients underwent PCI before TAVI due to functionally significant left main CAD and/or severe stenosis ≥ 90%. 31 patients underwent FFR measurements in cumulative 38 coronary lesions. Prior to TAVI, a negative FFR could be detected in 18 lesions, whereas a positive FFR was found in entirely 20 lesions. A control angiography and FFR measurement was performed in cumulative 13 lesions. Comparing the FFR values, there was no significant difference (0.77 ± 0.04 vs. 0.76 ± 0.08; p = 0.11). CONCLUSION: Concomitant CAD was diagnosed in 53.3% of TAVI patients. FFR did not significantly change after TAVI, confirming the validity of FFR to evaluate coronary lesions in this specific clinical setting. Given the low rates of cardiac adverse events, it might therefore be considered to treat coronary stenoses not involving left main and those with a diameter stenosis < 90% after TAVI.  "
Denosumab or romosozumab therapy and risk of cardiovascular events in patients with primary osteoporosis: Systematic review and meta- analysis.  ;"BACKGROUND: Osteoporosis and cardiovascular (CV) diseases are closely correlated. RANKL/RANK/OPG pathway and Wnt signalling pathway both implicated in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis and cardiovascular diseases. We aimed to investigate the effect of denosumab or romosozumab therapy on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with primary osteoporosis. METHODS: PubMed, Cochrane library, and EMBASE databases were systematically searched from the inception dates to June 4, 2019. Randomized clinical trials evaluating the effect of denosumab or romosozumab versus active comparators or placebo for at least 6 months in patients with primary osteoporosis or osteopenia were included. Two investigators independently extracted data for study characteristics, outcomes of interest, and risk of bias in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. RESULTS: 17 relevant studies (denosumab: n=11, 13615 participants; romosozumab: n=6, 12219 participants) were included. No associations between denosumab therapy and risk of a composite cardiovascular outcome (1.06 [95 % CI, 0.88-1.28], p=0.54), three-point major adverse cardiovascular event (3P MACE, 1.01 [95 % CI, 0.83-1.23], p=0.93), and four-point major adverse cardiovascular event (4P MACE, 0.99 [95 % CI, 0.83-1.18], p=0.89) were identified. Romosozumab therapy did not increase the risk of composite cardiovascular outcome (1.26 [95 % CI, 0.95-1.68], p=0.11), and 3P MACE (1.41 [95 % CI, 0.99-2.02], p=0.06), while increased the risk of 4P MACE (1.39 [95 % CI, 1.01-1.90], p=0.04) among elderly men and postmenopausal woman with osteoporosis over a period of 12-36 months. Denosumab or romosozumab did not increase or reduce specific cardiovascular outcomes, including CV death or death, myocardial infarction, stroke, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, aortic and intracranial aneurysm, aortic dissection, aortic valve disease and hypertension (all p＞0.05). Sensitivity analysis conducted by random effects model altered the result of 4P MACE in romosozumab (1.36 [0.99-1.87], p=0.06). No other significant difference was detected in the sensitivity analyses and subgroup analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Denosumab therapy was not associated with any risk of composite and specific cardiovascular outcomes among patients with primary osteoporosis than active comparators or placebo, while romosozumab therapy might increase the risk of 4P MACE.

Perioperative Outcomes of Minimally Invasive Aortic Arch Reconstruction with Branched Grafts Through a Partial Upper Sternotomy.  ;BACKGROUND: Ministernotomy has been advocated over recent years as an alternative technique for different cardiovascular surgical procedures to reduce the surgical trauma associated with conventional full sternotomy. In recent years, several reports have addressed minimally invasive approaches to the proximal aorta and aortic arch through a partial upper sternotomy (PUS). We reviewed our experience of minimally invasive open aortic arch reconstruction with a branched graft through a PUS. METHODS: Between February 2016 and December 2018, 22 patients underwent open arch repair through a PUS. Moderate hypothermic circulatory arrest and antegrade selective cerebral perfusion were used for organ protection. The median patient age was 76 years (range, 65-86). Renal insufficiency was observed in 14 patients (64%) and chronic lung disease, in 11 (50%). Total arch replacement was performed in 20 patients (91%), while the remaining 2 (9%) received partial arch replacement with reconstruction of two supraaortic vessels. Aortic valve replacement with a tissue valve or aortic valve repair was each performed concomitantly in one patient (5%) as a concomitant procedure. The median durations of cardiopulmonary bypass, aortic cross-clamping, and circulatory arrest were 214, 109, and 50 min, respectively. RESULTS: No early deaths, permanent neurological deficits, or spinal cord injuries occurred. One patient (5%) required intraoperative conversion to full sternotomy because of bleeding caused by a venting cannula injury. Three patients (14%) required re-exploration because of bleeding. Prolonged ventilation occurred in 2 patients (9%) with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. CONCLUSIONS: Minimally invasive aortic arch reconstruction with branched grafts through a PUS can be safely performed with satisfactory perioperative outcomes.  
Low-Risk Transcatheter Versus Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement - An Updated Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.  ;OBJECTIVES: To perform a meta-analysis including all available randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to date comparing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) and low surgical risk. BACKGROUND: Current guidelines recommend SAVR for patients with severe symptomatic AS and low surgical risk. A few RCTs have evaluated TAVR in low surgical risk patients but equipoise exists related to TAVR valve durability, paravalvular leak (PVL) and role of TAVR in younger, low surgical risk patients. METHODS: Five databases were analyzed from January-2000 to March-2019 for RCTs comparing SAVR to TAVR in low-risk severe AS patients. RESULTS: Four RCTs on low-risk TAVR patients with 2887 patients were included. Mean follow-up was ~24.1 ± 24 months. Early mortality was lower with TAVR compared to SAVR (RR: 0.44, 95% CI: 0.20-0.95, P = 0.038) whereas long-term mortality was similar (RR: 0.67, 95% CI: 0.39-1.14, P = 0.141). Both early and long-term stroke rates were similar. TAVR was associated with lower risk of atrial fibrillation, major bleeding, acute kidney injury (AKI) and rehospitalization, but higher rates of permanent pacemaker implantation (PPM) and moderate or severe PVL. There was no difference in major vascular complications, myocardial infarction, endocarditis, aortic valve gradients and valve area at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: In low-risk patients with severe AS, TAVR has a lower early mortality compared to SAVR with no difference in long-term mortality. Although complication rates varied between TAVR and SAVR, our study findings suggest that transfemoral-TAVR is an appropriate treatment option for severe symptomatic AS in patients with low surgical risk.

Whole blood platelet aggregation kinetics under cardiopulmonary bypass: A pilot study.  ;"Assessing the platelets' functional status during surgery on cardiopulmonary bypass is challenging. This study used multiple electrode impedance aggregometry (Multiplate®) to create a timeline of platelet aggregation changes as induced by cardiopulmonary bypass in antiplatelet-naive patients undergoing elective surgery for mitral valve regurgitation. We performed six consecutive measurements (T1: pre-operatively, T2: after heparinization, T3: 3 min after establishment of cardiopulmonary bypass, T4: immediately after administration of cardioplegia, T5: 5 min after administration of cardioplegia, and T6: 45 min after administration of cardioplegia). Platelet aggregation was determined after stimulation with 3.2-μg/mL collagen, 6.4-μM adenosine diphosphate, and 32-μM thrombin receptor activating peptide. Five patients were included (age: 64 ± 10 years, one female). We observed a decrease in hematocrit levels by -17.1% ± 3.7% (T1 vs T6) with a drop after establishment of cardiopulmonary bypass (T2 vs T3) and slightly decreasing platelet counts by -6.2% ± 7.7% (T1 vs T6). Immediately after establishment of cardiopulmonary bypass (T2 vs T3), we observed reduced platelet aggregation responses for stimulation with adenosine diphosphate (-19.7% ± 12.8%) and thrombin receptor activating peptide (-19.3% ± 6.3%). Interestingly, we found augmented platelet aggregation for all stimuli 45 min after administration of cardioplegia (T5 vs T6) with the strongest increase for collagen (+83.4% ± 42.8%; adenosine diphosphate: +39.0% ± 37.2%; thrombin receptor activating peptide: +34.5% ± 18.5%). Thus, after an initial drop due to hemodilution upon establishment of cardiopulmonary bypass, platelet reactivity increased over time which was not outweighed by decreasing platelet counts due to mechanical platelet destruction and absorption. These findings have implications for rational transfusion, peri-operative antiplatelet therapy, and for the management of patients on other extracorporeal support, such as extracorporeal life support or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.

Prevalence and risk factors of aortic stenosis and aortic sclerosis: a 21-year follow-up of middle-aged men.  ;"Introduction. There is limited knowledge about factors associated with the development of aortic stenosis. This study aimed to examine the prevalence of aortic sclerosis or stenosis in 71-years-old men and determine which risk factors at 50 years of age predict the development of aortic sclerosis or aortic stenosis. Methods. A random sample of Swedish men from the general population, born in 1943 (n = 798) were followed for 21 years. Data on clinical characteristics and laboratory values were collected in 1993. An echocardiography was performed in 2014. We used logistic regression to examine the association between baseline data and the outcome. Results. Echocardiography was performed in 535 men, and aortic sclerosis or aortic stenosis was diagnosed in 27 (5.0%). 14 persons developed aortic stenosis (2.6%). Among men with aortic sclerosis or aortic stenosis, 29.6% were obese. In multivariable stepwise regression model, body mass index (odds ratio per unit increase 1.23 (95% CI 1.10-1.38; p = .0003)) and hypercholesterolemia, combined with high sensitive C-reactive protein (odds ratio versus all other 2.66 (1.18-6.00; p = .019)) were significantly associated with increased risk of developing aortic sclerosis or aortic stenosis. Body mass index was the only factor significantly associated with a higher risk of developing aortic stenosis. Conclusion. The prevalence of either aortic sclerosis or aortic stenosis was 5% and of aortic stenosis 2.6%. Obesity and hypercholesterolemia combined with elevated high sensitive C-reactive protein at the age of 50 predicted the development of degenerative aortic sclerosis or stenosis, whilst only obesity was correlated with the occurrence of aortic stenosis.

Cardiovascular Outcomes with Transcatheter vs. Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement in Low-Risk Patients: An Updated Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.  ;"BACKGROUND: TAVR is an established treatment option in high and intermediate-risk patients with severe AS. There is less data regarding the efficacy of TAVR in low-risk patients. This meta-analysis evaluated efficacy and safety outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in comparison to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in low-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS). METHODS: Databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared TAVR with SAVR for the treatment of low-risk patients with severe AS. We calculated pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using the random-effects model. RESULTS: The final analysis included 2953 patients from 5 studies. Compared to SAVR, TAVR was associated with similar mid-term mortality [OR 0.67; 95% CI 0.37-1.21; p = 0.18], as well as similar short-term mortality [OR 0.51; 95% CI 0.24-1.11; p = 0.09]. Randomization to TAVR was associated with a reduced risk of developing acute kidney injury [OR 0.26; 95% CI 0.13-0.52; p < 0.001], short-term major bleeding [OR 0.27; 95% CI 0.12-0.60; p < 0.001] and new-onset atrial fibrillation [OR 0.17; 95% CI 0.14-0.21; p < 0.001]. However, TAVR was associated with a higher risk of requiring permanent pacemaker implantation [OR 4.25; 95% CI 1.86-9.73; p < 0.001]. There was no significant difference in the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, endocarditis or aortic valve re-intervention between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis showed that TAVR has similar clinical efficacy to SAVR, with a more favorable safety profile, in patients with severe AS who are at low-surgical risk.  "

A meta-analysis of ≥5-year mortality after transcatheter versus surgical aortic valve replacement.  ;INTRODUCTION: It remains unclear whether long-term survival is superior following transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) than following surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). We performed a meta-analysis of mortality with ≥5-year follow-up in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and propensity-score matched (PSM) studies of TAVI versus SAVR. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched through March 2019. Eligible studies were RCTs or PSM studies of TAVI versus SAVR enrolling patients with severe aortic stenosis and reporting all-cause mortality with ≥5-year follow-up as an outcome. A hazard ratio of mortality for TAVI versus SAVR was extracted from each individual study. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Our search identified 3 RCTs and 7 PSM studies enrolling 5498 patients. A pooled analysis of all 10 studies demonstrated a statistically significant 38% increase in mortality with TAVI relative to SAVR. A subgroup meta-analysis showed no statistically significant difference between TAVI and AVR in RCTs and a statistically significant 68% increase with TAVI relative to SAVR in PSM studies. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of a meta-analysis of 7 PSM studies, TAVI is associated with greater all-cause mortality with ≥5-year follow-up than SAVR. However, another meta-analysis of 3 RCTs suggests no difference in mortality between TAVI and SAVR.  
Quantification of mitral valve regurgitation by 2D and 3D echocardiography compared with cardiac magnetic resonance a systematic review and meta-analysis.  ;By means of systematic literature review and meta-analysis, we compared results of studies examining different echocardiographic methods assessing severity of mitral valve regurgitation volume (MVR) with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) as standard reference. A systematic search of electronic databases revealed twenty studies eligible for meta-analysis. Results of 2D- and 3D-trans-thoracic (TTE) and trans-esophageal echocardiographic (TEE) proximal isovelocity surface area (PISA) and volumetric methods were compared with CMR. Mean differences (ml) with 95% limits of agreement (LoA) derived from Bland-Altman tests and correlations coefficients [(R) 95% confidence interval (CI)] were pooled together. Overall 1187 patients [mean age = 59 ± 13 years and 678(57%) males] with primary or secondary mild to severe MVR were included. Comparing all echocardiographic methods with CMR showed an overestimation and moderate agreement with difference and 95% LoA of 8.05(- 3.40, 19.49) ml, R = 0.73(95% CI 0.71-0.76) p < 0.001. 3D-PISA followed by 3D-volumetric methods showed the better agreement with an underestimation of - 3.20(- 12.33, 5.92) ml, R = 0.84(95% CI 0.78-0.89) p < 0.001 and overestimation of 3.73(- 9.17, 16.61) ml, R = 0.90(95% CI 0.87, 0.94) p < 0.001, respectively. 2D-volumetric method showed the poorest agreement with difference and 95% LoA of 23.56(- 4.19, 51.31) ml, R = 0.64(95% CI 0.54-0.73) p < 0.001. In patients (n = 280) with severe MVR, 2D technique incorrectly estimated regurgitation volume severity in 106 (38%) compared to 4(14%) patients using 3D technique. Among echocardiographic methods 3D-PISA agreed best with CMR as reference, making 3D-PISA the most reliable method to quantify MVR. CMR can be considered in severe MVR where uncertainties arise and a decision-making prior valve surgery is required. Further powerful studies are needed to assess the accuracy of different echocardiographic methods.  
Intravenous Sotalol for the Treatment of Ventricular Dysrhythmias in an Infant on Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation.  ;Sotalol is a class III anti-arrhythmic agent with beta receptor blocking properties. Intravenous (IV) sotalol may be useful to treat refractory atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. A report on the efficacy and safety of IV sotalol in an infant on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), who developed refractory ventricular arrhythmias following surgery for congenital heart disease. A 10-day old infant with severe pulmonary valve stenosis underwent surgical pulmonary valvectomy and enlargement of the main pulmonary artery. Post-operatively, the patient developed hemodynamically significant accelerated idioventricular rhythm which was not responsive to a combination of amiodarone, lidocaine, and procainamide leading to 2 cardiac arrest events and placement on ECMO. The amiodarone infusion was uptitrated to 20 mcg/kg/min, but episodes of the hemodynamically compromising arrhythmia continued. Amiodarone was discontinued and IV sotalol was initiated at 42 mg/m2/day, divided to 3 doses, and administered every 8 h, which completely suppressed the arrhythmia. The initial sotalol dose was calculated based on a daily dose of 90 mg/m2 and reduced by an age-related factor as recommended by the FDA approved prescribing information. Subsequently, acute kidney injury requiring CRRT developed. The patient remained on IV sotalol for 3 weeks and then transitioned to oral sotalol. The oral dose was increased to 44 mg/m2/day (3.5 mg every 8 h) to account for the difference in bioavailability between the IV and oral formulations. Serial sotalol levels during IV and PO therapy remained therapeutic on ECMO and CRRT. The patient maintained normal sinus rhythm on sotalol without adverse events. IV sotalol in the setting of ECMO and CRRT was safe and effective in controlling refractory hemodynamically compromising accelerated idioventricular rhythm unresponsive to amiodarone.  
[Valvular heart disease in patients with chronic kidney disease].  ;"Valvular heart disease is a common comorbidity in patients with impaired renal function, especially in those with end-stage renal disease undergoing dialysis. Sclerosis and calcification of the heart valves and the valve ring are particularly relevant in the etiology of the diseases. These typically occur at the aortic and mitral valves and can lead to both insufficiency and stenosis of the affected valve. In the current guidelines of the European Society for Cardiology published in 2017, surgical treatment remains the standard of care for most forms of severe valvular heart disease; however, the presence of chronic kidney disease impairs clinical outcomes and is associated with higher mortality rates when compared to patients with preserved renal function. Catheter-based treatment options have emerged as an effective and safe alternative for patients >75 years and/or with increased surgical risk. Consequently, in patients with appropriate anatomy and elevated risk, interventional treatment options should also be discussed in the heart team.  "

Management of the adult Fontan patient.  ;Adults with congenital heart disease who underwent the Fontan operation to palliate single ventricle heart defects-by direct connection of caval venous return to the pulmonary circulation-have improved survival due to advancements in surgical and interventional techniques. However, cardiac and non-cardiac comorbidities often coexist, complicating management, and contributing to premature morbidity and mortality. Cardiac issues include heart failure symptoms related to systolic and diastolic dysfunction, atrial and ventricular arrhythmias and systemic atrioventricular valve regurgitation. Structural issues may be related to obstruction of the Fontan pathway, or to branch pulmonary artery stenosis, both of which exacerbate symptoms. Non-cardiac complications in adults involve hepatic congestion, fibrosis and cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, chronic kidney disease, stroke, venous stasis, lymphatic issues and involvement of other organ systems. 'Fontan failure' refers to circulatory dysfunction, either cardiac, non-cardiac, or both, diagnosed after exclusion or treatment of reversible contributors such as structural issues and arrhythmias. Counselling about reproductive health, mental health, perioperative management and overall wellness are paramount for patients' well-being. Fontan patients are typically managed in highly specialised adult congenital heart centres, but may present to cardiologists or other practitioners with cardiac and non-cardiac emergencies or urgencies, sometimes after being out of care. In this review, we discuss the management of the adult Fontan patient, including surveillance, cardiac and non-cardiac complications, reproductive health, and advanced therapies.

Feasibility and safety of transcaval transcatheter aortic valve implantation: a multicentre European registry.  ;AIMS: A transfemoral transarterial approach is considered the preferable access route for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), followed by a transaxillary/subclavian TAVI approach. However, these approaches may not be an option in all patients. This study aimed to report the initial European experience with transfemoral transcaval TAVI. METHODS AND RESULTS: Data on 50 patients treated by transcaval TAVI in five European centres were collected and analysed according to the Valve Academic Research Consortium (VARC)-2 definitions. The study population had a mean age of 78.7±8.0 years and a high surgical risk profile (median STS risk score 6.1%, interquartile range 3.0-11.2%). Transcaval access was successful in 49 out of 50 patients and device success was obtained in 94% of cases. Closure of the caval-aortic puncture site with a nitinol cardiac occluder was successful in all cases without need for emergent surgery. One patient received additional sealing of the aortic puncture site with a covered stent one day post TAVI due to a gradual haemoglobin drop of 3 g/dL. VARC-2-defined life-threatening bleeding and major vascular complications possibly related to transcaval access were 4% and 10%, respectively. There were no bleeding or vascular complications after discharge. At 30 days, the clinical efficacy endpoint was reached in 88% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Transfemoral transcaval access proved to be a feasible and safe TAVI approach for high-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis not suitable for transfemoral or transaxillary/subclavian transarterial access.  
Systematic review and meta-analysis of current risk models in predicting short-term mortality after transcatheter aortic valve replacement.  ;"AIMS: The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of risk stratification models (RSMs) in predicting short-term mortality after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). METHODS AND RESULTS: MEDLINE and Scopus were queried to identify studies which validated RSMs designed to assess 30-day or in-hospital mortality after TAVR. Discrimination and calibration were assessed using C-statistics and observed/expected ratios (OERs), respectively. C-statistics were pooled using a random-effects inverse-variance method, while OERs were pooled using the Peto odds ratio. A good RSM is defined as one with a C-statistic >0.7 and an OER close to 1.0. Twenty-four studies (n=68,215 patients) testing 11 different RSMs were identified. Discrimination of all RSMs was poor (C-statistic <0.7); however, certain TAVR-specific RSMs such as the in-hospital STS/ACC TVT (C-statistic=0.65) and STT (C-statistic=0.66) predicted individual mortality more reliably than surgical models (C-statistic range=0.59-0.61). A good calibration was demonstrated by the in-hospital STS/ACC TVT (OER=0.99), 30-day STS/ACC TVT (OER=1.08) and STS (OER=1.01) models. Baseline dialysis (OER: 2.64 [1.88, 3.70]; p<0.001) was the strongest predictor of mortality. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that the STS/ACC TVT model (in-hospital and 30-day) and the STS model have accurate calibration, making them useful for comparison of centre-level risk-adjusted mortality. In contrast, the discriminative ability of currently available models is limited.  "
Outcomes of mitral valve replacement with bileaflet mechanical prosthetic valve in children.  ;"OBJECTIVES: We examined the outcomes following mitral valve replacement with bileaflet mechanical prosthetic valve in children and identified the predictors for mortality and reoperation. METHODS: Medical records from 49 children who underwent mitral valve replacement between 1982 and 2015 were reviewed retrospectively. Median age and body weight at initial mitral valve replacement were 2.4 years and 9.7 kg, respectively. The median follow-up was 13 years. Surgical results and predictors for mortality and reoperation were investigated. RESULTS: There was no operative mortality; eight late deaths occurred. The actuarial survival rates were 89.5%, 84.2%, and 80.7% at 5, 10, and 15 years, respectively, after initial mitral valve replacement. The actuarial freedom rates from related complications were 89.5%, 78.3%, and 70.7% at 5, 10, and 15 years, respectively. Nineteen patients required 1st re-mitral valve replacement at a median of 5.9 years; six of these 19 required 2nd re-mitral valve replacement at a median of 8.9 years after 1st re-MVR. The actuarial freedom rates from re-mitral valve replacement were 86.0%, 56.8%, and 44.2% at 5, 10, and 15 years, respectively. No predictor for death was determined; however, the predictor for re-mitral valve replacement was initial valve diameter less than 19 mm. CONCLUSIONS: Survival outcomes among children after mitral valve replacement with bileaflet mechanical prosthetic valve in biventricular heart were satisfactory. However, complications, including re-mitral valve replacement, were frequent and the predictor was of a small prosthesis size.  "
The learning curve of minimally invasive aortic valve replacement for aortic valve stenosis.  ;OBJECTIVE: Few clinical studies have been conducted to evaluate the learning curve of minimally invasive aortic valve replacement. The purpose of this study was to retrospectively analyze the learning curve of initial and isolated minimally invasive aortic valve replacement for aortic valve stenosis which performed at our institution. METHODS: This study included 126 patients who underwent initial and isolated minimally invasive aortic valve replacement via right infra-axillary mini thoracotomy for aortic valve stenosis. Patients were divided into the first 50 patients [1-50 cases: E group (n = 50)] and the last 76 patients [51-126 cases: L group (n = 76)]. RESULTS: A significantly shorter operative time (239.4 ± 35.2 min vs. 206.5 ± 25.5 min, P < 0.001), cardiopulmonary bypass time (151.1 ± 27.4 min vs. 126.9 ± 20.2 min, P < 0.001) and aortic cross-clamp time (115.2 ± 19.0 min vs. 93.9 ± 14.7 min, P < 0.001) were found in the L group. The learning curves of operative time, cardiopulmonary bypass time, and aortic cross-clamp time plateaued after 40 cases. CONCLUSIONS: Learning curves were observed in surgical processes such as operative time. A total of 40-50 cases are required to achieve a stable operative time. However, patient outcomes were not significantly different between the groups. This study could be helpful in introducing minimally invasive aortic valve replacement and designing training programs.  
The Effect of Downsizing on the Normal Tricuspid Annulus.  ;Tricuspid annuloplasty is a surgical procedure that cinches the valve's annulus in order to reduce regurgitant blood flow. One of its critical parameters is the degree of downsizing. To provide insight into the effect of downsizing, we studied the annulus of healthy sheep during suture annuloplasty. To this end, we implanted fiduciary markers along the annulus of sheep and subsequently performed a DeVega suture annuloplasty. We performed five downsizing steps in each animal while recording hemodynamic and sonomicrometry data in beating hearts. Subsequently, we used splines to approximate the annulus at baseline and at each downsizing step. Based on these approximations we computed clinical metrics of annular shape and dynamics, and the continuous field metrics height, strain, and curvature. With these data, we demonstrated that annular area reduction during downsizing was primarily driven by compression of the anterior annulus. Similarly, reduction in annular dynamics was driven by reduced contractility in the anterior annulus. Finally, changes in global height and eccentricity of the annulus could be explained by focal changes in the continuous height profile and changes in annular curvature. Our findings are important as they provide insight into a regularly performed surgical procedure and may inform the design of transcatheter devices that mimic suture annuloplasty.  
Accuracy of three-dimensional echocardiography in candidates for transcatheter aortic valve replacement.  ;"The correct determination of aortic annulus dimensions is a crucial step to avoid complications in Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR). Currently, the gold standard method for the evaluation of the aortic annulus is Multidetector Computed Tomography (MDCT), which is limited by the risk of contrast-induced nephropathy. Three-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography automated software (3DTEEa) have been used as an alternative in patients with contra-indications to MDCT. We aimed to evaluate the accuracy of 3DTEEa-derived aortic annulus dimensions; to assess the influence of calcification in the agreement between 3DTEEa and MDCT; and to determine reclassification in prosthesis size choice if 3DTEEa was the only imaging method. One hundred and seven consecutive patients referred for TAVR were studied. Aortic annulus dimensions were determined using MDCT and 3DTEE manual (3DTEEm) and automated measurements. Valve calcification was assessed with MDCT. Limits of agreement (LOA) were narrower for 3DTEEa (minimum diameter: mean bias 0.60; LOA - 2.94 to 4.14; maximum diameter: mean bias 0.20; LOA - 3.82 to 4.22) as compared to 3DTEEm (minimum diameter: mean bias 0.22; LOA - 3.84 to 4.28; maximum diameter: mean bias - 1.25; LOA - 6.37; 3.86). Compared to MDCT, 3DTEEa overestimated while 3DTEEm underestimated most parameters. No differences were found in average bias between methods according to quartiles of valve calcification. Most patients would have received the same size valve (63.9%) if 3DTEEa was the only available method. Measurement of aortic annulus dimensions using a 3DTEE automatic software is feasible and not influenced by valve calcification. It may be an alternative for patients who cannot undergo MDCT.  "
Candida Parapsilosis Endocarditis Following Transcatheter Pulmonary Valve Implantation.  ;Fungal prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) is rare and carries a high mortality rate. While uncommon, fungal endocarditis in transcatheter aortic valves has been reported. We present a unique case of Candida parapsilosis fungal PVE in a patient with a transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement.  
Congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries: is it really a transposition? An anatomical study of the right ventricular septal surface.  ;Congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries (ccTGA) is a rare congenital malformation which associates discordant atrioventricular and ventriculo-arterial connections. Although frequently associated with a ventricular septal defect (VSD), its anatomy remains controversial. This could be due in hearts with usual atrial arrangement to the apparently different anatomy of the left-sided right ventricle compared with a right-sided right ventricle. We wanted to compare the RV septal anatomy between ccTGA, transposition of the great arteries and normal heart and to determine the anatomy of the VSD in ccTGA. We analysed 102 human heart specimens: 31 ccTGA, 36 transpositions of the great arteries, 35 normal hearts. According to the last classification of VSD (ICD-11), VSD were classified as outlet if located above the superoseptal commissure of the tricuspid valve and inlet if underneath. We measured the lengths of the superior and inferior limbs of the septal band and the angle between the two limbs. To assess the orientation of the septal band, we also measured the angle between superior limb and the arterial valve above. A VSD was present in 26 ccTGA (84%) and was an outlet VSD in 16 cases (61%). The mean angle between the two limbs of the septal band was 76.4° for ccTGA compared with 90.6° for transposition of the great arteries (P = 0.011) and 76.1° for normal hearts (P= NS). The mean angle between the superior limb of the septal band and the arterial valve above was 70.6° for ccTGA compared with 90.6° for transposition of the great arteries (P = 0.0004) and 69.1° for normal hearts (P= NS). The inferior limb of the septal band was significantly shorter in ccTGA (P < 0.0003): SL/IL length ratio was 21.4 for ccTGA, 2.2 for transposition of the great arteries and 1.5 for normal hearts. The typical VSD in ccTGA is an outlet VSD. Its frequent misdiagnosis as an inlet VSD might be explained by the shortness of the inferior limb, which creates the illusion of a posterior VSD, and by the fact that the VSD is usually assessed from the left ventricular aspect. Surprisingly, the orientation of the septal band is similar in ccTGA and normal heart, despite the discordant atrioventricular connections, and different in ccTGA and transposition of the great arteries, despite the discordant ventriculo-arterial connections. These findings suggest that the mechanism leading to transposition in ccTGA and in TGA probably is different. The term 'double discordance' might therefore be more appropriate as a description of this complex anomaly.  
Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement After Prior Mitral Valve Surgery: Results From the Transcatheter Valve Therapy Registry.  ;BACKGROUND: Due to perceived technical challenges, patients with previous surgical mitral valve repair or replacement (SMVR) have been excluded from most transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) trials. Our objective was to compare the 30-day and 1-year outcomes of TAVR for patients with and without prior SMVR. METHODS: In a retrospective review of The Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) and American College of Cardiology (ACC) Transcatheter Valve Therapy (TVT) Registry, we compared 1097 patients with prior SMVR to 46,327 patients without prior SMVR who underwent TAVR between November 2011 and September 2015 at 394 US centers. Preoperative characteristics, procedural details, and clinical outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: Patients with previous SMVR were younger, more often female, and had higher STS predicted risk of mortality (8.6% vs 6.8%, P < .001). However, there was no difference in 30-day mortality (4.6% vs 5.5%, P = .293), myocardial infarction, stroke, reintervention, new dialysis, or readmission. Moderate/severe paravalvular leak at discharge was also similar (5.8% vs 4.9%, P = .343). At 1 year, morbidity was similar with slightly higher mortality among patients with prior SMVR (20% vs 17.5%, P = .087) that was significant after adjustment (hazard ratio 1.18, P = .043). The type of prior SMVR (repair, bioprosthetic replacement, or mechanical replacement) had no impact on 30-day or 1-year survival. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with prior SMVR undergoing TAVR had similar 30-day outcomes, slightly higher 1-year mortality, and no increase in early paravalvular leak compared with patients who did not have previous SMVR. Prior SMVR should not preclude TAVR for appropriately selected patients.  
Does the pattern of bicuspid aortic valve leaflet fusion determine the success of the Ross procedure?  ;"BACKGROUND: In addition to being associated with aortopathy, a bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) has been posed to be a risk factor for the dilation of the pulmonary autograft in the aortic position. The aim of this study is to assess the association between the subtype of native aortic valve leaflet fusion (right and noncoronary leaflets [R/N] vs right and left leaflets [R/L]) and autograft dilation and valve dysfunction after the Ross procedure. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of 43 patients with BAV who underwent a Ross procedure in our center from 1993 to 2013. Serial transthoracic echocardiography was used to measure changes in autograft and ascending aortic diameter over time. The aortic diameter was measured at four levels, and Z values were computed. Aortic dilation was defined as a Z value greater than 3. RESULTS: The mean age at the time of the Ross procedure was 13.5 ± 9.2 years. R/L was the most prevalent native aortic valve subtype (R/L, n = 26, 61% vs R/N, n = 17, 39%). PreRoss procedure, aortic dilation was more frequent in patients with R/N fusion (P = .02), whereas the initial aortic valve gradient and grade of aortic insufficiency (AI) did not differ between the subgroups. At follow-up, (mean = 9.6 ± 4.3 years) dilation of the autograft and ascending aorta was seen more often in patients with R/N leaflet fusion (P = .03). Conversely, the prevalence of more than moderate AI was significantly higher in patients with R/L leaflet fusion (P = .03). There was no significant difference between groups among numbers of late reintervention on the aortic valve or root (P = .75); however the type of intervention varied by morphologic subtype. Patients with R/L fusion underwent more aortic valve replacements (AVRs) while patients with R/N fusion underwent more valve-sparing aortic root replacements. CONCLUSIONS: After Ross procedure, both groups of patients were likely to have a combination of dilation of the aortic root and the tubular portion of the ascending aorta at follow-up. Patients with R/L fusion were more likely to have a prevalence of root dilation, while patients with R/N fusion were more likely to have tubular ascending aorta dilation. The R/L phenotype is associated with a slightly more rapid dilation at follow-up and is more likely to have postoperative autograft insufficiency. This information may serve to guide patient and procedure selection for AVR.  "
Neoaortic Regurgitation in Patients with Transposition Long Term After an Arterial Switch Operation and Its Relation to the Root Diameters and Surgical Technique Used.  ;"Neoaortic regurgitation and root dilatation are common findings in patients with transposition after an arterial switch operation. The aim of this study was to describe the relation between neoaortic regurgitation long term after an arterial switch procedure, aortic root diameters, and surgical technique used. We also assessed the agreement of the neoaortic regurgitation grade and root diameters in different imaging modalities. For this retrospective study, we qualified 56 consecutive patients who, according to our institutional protocol, had a routine postoperative evaluation of more than 16 years with multimodality imaging studies. Neoaortic regurgitation was assessed by both transthoracic echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging, and the root diameters obtained by echocardiography and tomography were compared to the reference values and associated with the presence of neoaortic insufficiency. Neoaortic insufficiency was present in 75% of examined patients; the vast majority of them had trace or mild regurgitation, and its qualitative evaluation was significantly different between echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging. In our study group, the neoaortic valve and aortic sinus were larger in relation to the normal values, and they were significantly correlated with the presence of neoaortic insufficiency, but not with the surgical technique used. Values obtained by echocardiography and tomography correlated well but were significantly different. Transthoracic echocardiography has a tendency to overestimate the severity of regurgitation compared to magnetic resonance imaging. Neoaortic valve and sinus dilatation are significantly correlated with valve insufficiency, but in most cases of root dilatation, the valve remains competent.  "
Cardiovascular Testing Detects Underlying Dysfunction in Childhood Leukemia Survivors.  ;"PURPOSE: Childhood leukemia survivors commonly develop late-onset cardiovascular disease after treatment with anthracyclines. Resting echocardiogram is the standard procedure for monitoring cardiac health but this method may not be sensitive enough to detect subclinical injury. Exercise echocardiography may provide a viable alternative. METHODS: Nineteen (9 males; age, 19 ± 3 yr) anthracycline-treated survivors of childhood leukemia and 17 (8 males) healthy individuals of similar age (22 ± 2 yr) were recruited. All survivors had normal resting echocardiography upon recruitment. Exercise echocardiography was performed using contemporary imaging techniques. Flow-mediated dilation (FMD), body composition, and cardiorespiratory fitness (V˙O2peak) were assessed to determine predisposition to additional disease. RESULTS: Mitral valve peak flow velocity in late diastole (interaction, P = 0.007) increased from rest in survivors (P = 0.023) and controls (P = 0.020) immediately postexercise but did not recover again in the survivors (exercise-recovery, P = 0.784) after recuperation. Consequently, E/A ratio (interaction, P < 0.001) was lower in the survivors at recovery (P < 0.001). Survivors had reduced FMD (7.88 ± 1.70 vs 9.65 ± 2.83; P = 0.030), maximal and recovery HR (P = 0.001; P < 0.001), minute ventilation (P < 0.001), and V˙O2peak (absolute, 2.64 ± 0.62 vs 3.14 ± 0.74 L·min, P = 0.034; relative, 36.78 ± 11.49 vs 45.14 ± 6.80 mL·kg·min; P = 0.013) compared with controls. They also had higher total body fat (percentage, P = 0.034; mass, P = 0.024) and fat mass in the central (P = 0.050), peripheral (P = 0.039) and visceral (P < 0.001) regions. Survivors matched controls with regard to height (173.0 ± 7.8 cm vs 173.8 ± 9.1 cm; P = 0.796), body mass (76.16 ± 19.05 kg vs 70.07 ± 13.96 kg; P = 0.287) and body mass index (25.2 ± 5.1 vs 22.9 ± 2.7; P = 0.109). CONCLUSIONS: Exercise echocardiography unmasked subclinical diastolic dysfunction that may indicate late anthracycline toxicity in apparently healthy survivors of childhood leukemia. Presence of secondary risk factors indicates increased predisposition to comorbidities and highlights the importance of assessing cardiovascular health during follow-up.  "

Population trends in aortic valve surgery in Finland between 2001 and 2016.  ;"Objectives. To investigate nationwide changes in procedure rates, patient selection, and prognosis after all surgical aortic valve replacements. Design. Patients undergoing primary surgical aortic valve replacement between 2001 and 2016 were identified from three nationwide registers with compulsory reporting to examine trends in aortic valve surgery over four four-year time periods. Results. A total of 12,139 surgical aortic valve replacement procedures (mean age 61.9 ± 11.8 years, 39.1% women) were performed. The total number of biological valves increased from 1001 (42.9%) to 2526 (75.5%) from 2001-2004 to 2013-2016 (p < .001). During the first and last time periods the comorbidity burden increased; share of patients with hypertension increased from 37.5% to 46.9% (p < .001), diabetes from 14% to 16.5% (p = .01) and previous stroke from 5.2% to 7.2% (p = .01). The proportion of women undergoing surgery decreased from 40% to 36.1% from 2001-2004 to 2013-2016, respectively (p = .01). Overall 28-day mortality was 3.5%. In patients with biologic valve the multivariable-adjusted risk of short-term mortality decreased steadily in every four-year period from 2001-2004 to 2005-2008 (HR, 0.66; 95% CI 0.47-9.92), 2009-2012 (HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.39-0.75) and 2013-2016 (HR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.29-0.58), whereas short-term mortality remained similar in patients with mechanical valve. The risk of four-year postoperative mortality after all surgical aortic valve replacements stayed constant. Conclusions. The use of biologic aortic valve prosthesis has increased from 2001 to 2016. The proportion of women has declined markedly. The short-term mortality has decreased and the long-term mortality has stayed constant despite increasing comorbidity burden.  "
Identifying patients likely to be readmitted after transcatheter aortic valve replacement.  ;Hospital readmission following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) contributes considerably to the costs of care. Readmission rates following TAVR have been reported to be as high as 17.4% at 30 days and 53.2% at 1 year. Patient and procedural factors predict an increased likelihood of readmission including non-transfemoral access, acute and chronic kidney impairment, chronic lung disease, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, atrial fibrillation, major bleeding and prolonged index hospitalisation. Recent studies have also found the requirement for new pacemaker implantation and the severity of paravalvular aortic regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation to be novel predictors of readmission. Post-TAVR readmission within 30 days of discharge is more likely to occur for non-cardiac than cardiac pathology, although readmission for cardiac causes, especially heart failure, predicts higher mortality than readmission for non-cardiac causes. To combat the risk of readmission and associated mortality, the routine practice of calculating and considering readmission risk should be adopted by the heart team. Furthermore, because most readmissions following TAVR occur for non-cardiac reasons, more holistic approaches to readmission prevention are necessary. Familiarity with the most common predictors and causes of readmission should guide the development of initiatives to address these conditions proactively.  
Validation of the echocardiographic assessment of epicardial adipose tissue thickness at the Rindfleisch fold for the prediction of coronary artery disease.  ;"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Echocardiography is a promising technique for the assessment of epicardial adipose tissue (EAT). Increased EAT thickness is associated with different cardiac diseases, including; coronary artery disease (CAD). Since several different echocardiographic approaches have been proposed to measure EAT, the identification of a standardized method is needed. We propose the assessment of EAT maximal thickness at the Rindfleisch fold, the reproducibility of this measurement and its correlation with EAT thickness and volume assessed at cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR). Finally, we will test the predictive role of this measurement on the presence of significant CAD. METHODS AND RESULTS: In 1061 patients undergoing echocardiography, EAT thickness was measured at the level of the Rindfleisch fold. In 70 patients, we tested the relationship between echo-EAT thickness and EAT thickness and volume assessed at CMR. In 499 patients with suspected CAD, undergoing coronary artery angiography, we tested the predictive value of EAT on the presence of significant CAD. Echo-EAT thickness measurements had an excellent reliability as indicated by the inter-observer (ICC:0.97; 95% C.I. 0.96 to 0.98) and intra-observer (ICC:0.99; 95% C.I. 0.98 to 0.99) reliability rates. Echo-EAT thickness significantly correlated with CMR-EAT thickness and volume (p < 0.001). An EAT thickness value >10 mm discriminated patients with significant CAD at coronary angiography (p < 0.001). At multivariable analysis, including demographic data and cardiovascular risk factors, EAT thickness was an independent predictor of significant CAD and showed an additive predictive value over common atherosclerotic risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Echocardiographic assessment of EAT thickness at the level of the Rindfleisch fold represents a simple and trustworthy method. An increased EAT thickness shows an additive predictive value on CAD over common atherosclerotic risk factors, thus suggesting its potential clinical use for CAD risk stratification.  "
Pulmonary Artery Acceleration Time in Young Adulthood and Cardiovascular Outcomes Later in Life: The Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study.  ;"BACKGROUND: Lower pulmonary artery acceleration time (PAcT) is correlated with higher pulmonary artery pressure. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that PAcT measured in young adulthood would be associated with future cardiovascular outcomes. METHODS: In the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults year 5 examination (1990-1991), PAcT was measured as the time interval from onset to peak flow velocity at the pulmonary valve annulus on Doppler echocardiography. The primary outcome was a composite of fatal or nonfatal cardiovascular disease events: myocardial infarction, non-myocardial infarction acute coronary syndrome, coronary revascularization, congestive heart failure, stroke, transient ischemic attack, carotid artery disease, and peripheral arterial disease. RESULTS: PAcT was obtained in 4,171 participants (mean age, 30 ± 4 years, 55% women, 51% white). PAcT groups obtained using linear spline methodology were as follows: group I, PAcT ≥ 196 msec (n = 122); group II, PAcT < 196 and ≥115 msec (n = 3,195); and group III, PAcT < 115 msec (n = 854). During follow-up (median, 24.9 years), the primary outcome occurred in 216 participants (5.2%); 66 of 854 (7.7%) of those with PAcT < 115 msec, 149 of 3,195 (4.7%) of those with intermediate PAcT level, and one of 122 (0.8%) of those with PAcT ≥ 196 msec. In a fully adjusted model, the lowest and intermediate PAcT groups had hazard ratios of 8.3 (95% CI, 1.1-62.1; P = .04) and 6.8 (95% CI, 0.9-50.5; P = .06), respectively, in comparison with the highest PAcT group. CONCLUSIONS: PAcT is useful for better identifying young adults at higher risk for cardiovascular events, who may benefit from a strict control of modifiable cardiovascular risk factors.  "
Aortic valve stenosis-multimodality assessment with PET/CT and PET/MRI.  ;Aortic valve disease is the most common form of heart valve disease in developed countries and a growing healthcare burden with an ageing population. Transthoracic and transoesophageal echocardiography remains central to the diagnosis and surveillance of patients with aortic stenosis, providing gold standard assessments of valve haemodynamics and myocardial performance. However, other multimodality imaging techniques are being explored for the assessment of aortic stenosis, including combined PET/CT and PET/MR. Both approaches provide unique information with respect to disease activity in the valve alongside more conventional anatomic assessments of the valve and myocardium in this condition. This review investigates the emerging use of PET/CT and PET/MR to assess patients with aortic stenosis, examining how the complementary data provided by each modality may be used for research applications and potentially in future clinical practice.  
Outcomes of urgent versus nonurgent transcatheter aortic valve replacement.  ;"BACKGROUND: There is a paucity of data regarding the outcomes of transcatheter valve replacement (TAVR) performed in an urgent clinical setting. METHODS: The Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database years 2011-2014 was used to identify hospitalizations for TAVR in the urgent setting. Using propensity score matching, we compared patients who underwent TAVR in nonurgent versus urgent settings. RESULTS: Among 42,154 hospitalizations in which TAVR was performed, 10,114 (24%) underwent urgent TAVR. There was an uptrend in the rate of urgent TAVR procedures (p = .001). The rates of in-hospital mortality among this group did not change during the study period (p = .713). Nonurgent TAVR was associated with lower mortality (odds ratio [OR] = 0.78; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.69-0.89, p < .001) compared with urgent TAVR. Nonurgent TAVR was associated with lower incidence of cardiogenic shock (OR = 0.46; 95%CI: 0.40-0.53 p < .001), use of mechanical circulatory support devices (OR = 0.69; 95%CI: 0.59-0.82, p < .001), AKI (OR = 0.60; 95%CI: 0.56-0.64 p < .001), hemodialysis (OR = 0.67; 95%CI: 0.56-0.80 p < .001), major bleeding (OR = 0.94; 95%CI: 0.89-0.99 p = .045) and shorter length of stay (7.08 ± 6.317 vs. 12.39 ± 9.737 days, p < .001). There was no difference in acute stroke (OR = 0.96; 95%CI: 0.81-1.14, p = .636), vascular complications (OR = 1.07; 95%CI: 0.89-1.29, p = .492), and pacemaker insertions (OR = 0.92; 95%CI: 0.84-1.01, p = .067) between both groups. Among those undergoing urgent TAVR, subgroup analysis showed higher mortality in patients ≤80 years (p = .033), women (p < .001), chronic kidney disease (p = .001), heart failure (p < .001), and liver disease (p = .003). CONCLUSION: In this large nationwide analysis, almost a quarter of TAVR procedures were performed in the urgent settings. Although urgent TAVR was associated with higher mortality and increased complications compared with nonurgent TAVR, the absolute difference in in-hospital mortality was not remarkably higher. Thus, urgent TAVR can be considered as a reasonable approach when indicated.  "

Transapical septal myectomy in the beating heart via a minimally invasive approach: a feasibility study in swine.  ;OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to establish an original transapical septal myectomy procedure that can be performed in the beating heart via a minimally invasive approach for the treatment of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. METHODS: We designed an original intracardiac septum resection device to conduct off-pump septal myectomy in swine. A subxiphoid minithoracotomy was performed to access the apex of the heart. This resection device was inserted into the left ventricular outflow tract of the heart via the apex. The basal anteroseptal myocardium beneath the right aortic cusp was identified using a combination of transoesophageal and transthoracic echocardiography and then resected and collected by the device. RESULTS: Six consecutive operations were successfully and accurately performed using the custom-made device under echocardiographic guidance. All pigs survived and appeared to be normal until planned euthanasia 1 week after operation. A 300-700 mg portion of the septal myocardium was resected from the normal swine heart. Echocardiography and electrocardiogram revealed no abnormalities after resection. One exception was the fifth pig, in which mild annular regurgitation of the aortic valve occurred after repetitive resection. Postmortem necropsy demonstrated that all resections were correctly located at the basal anteroseptal septum beneath the right aortic cusp. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides the first proof-of-concept evidence for a novel beating heart transapical septal myectomy procedure, which showed promising translational potential for the treatment of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. This procedure would probably reduce operative risks and improve outcomes and reduce the demanding expertise required to perform conventional surgical myectomy.

Surgical treatment of a left anterior descending artery to the main pulmonary artery fistula.  ;We report a case of surgical treatment of a 58-year-old symptomatic patient with large coronary artery fistula, which drained from the left anterior descending artery into the main pulmonary artery (PA), and concomitant large patent foramen ovale. The surgery was performed through a median sternotomy with aortobicaval total cardiopulmonary bypass. The PA was incised. The fistula was identified 5 mm above the anterior leaflet of the pulmonary valve and was closed off using a prolene suture. Afterward, the atrium septum defect was closed with a Dacron patch via the standard right atrium access. There were no postoperative complications.  
Phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging and computational fluid dynamics assessment of thoracic aorta blood flow: a literature review.  ;The death rate from thoracic aortic disease is on the rise and represents a growing global health concern as patients are often asymptomatic before acute events, which have devastating effects on health-related quality of life. Biomechanical factors have been found to play a major role in the development of both acquired and congenital aortic diseases. However, much is still unknown and translational benefits of this knowledge are yet to be seen. Phase-contrast cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging of thoracic aortic blood flow has emerged as an exceptionally powerful non-invasive tool enabling visualization of complex flow patterns, and calculation of variables such as wall shear stress. This has led to multiple new findings in the areas of phenotype-dependent bicuspid valve flow patterns, thoracic aortic aneurysm formation and aortic prosthesis performance assessment. Phase-contrast cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging has also been used in conjunction with computational fluid modelling techniques to produce even more sophisticated analyses, by allowing the calculation of haemodynamic variables with exceptional temporal and spatial resolution. Translationally, these technologies may potentially play a major role in the emergence of precision medicine and patient-specific treatments in patients with aortic disease. This clinically focused review will provide a systematic overview of key insights from published studies to date.  
Transseptal access for left heart structural interventions in the setting of prior atrial septal defect closure.  ;"A transseptal puncture is critical for ""left-sided"" structural heart interventions. Procedures such as transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (MitraClip) and left atrial appendage (LAA) closure (Watchman) require precise puncture of the interatrial septum (IAS), and the presence of a prior atrial septal defect (ASD) closure device poses a challenge. We aim to present a successfully completed case of MitraClip and Watchman in the presence of ASD closure device in two different patients. A review of the literature will be reported, and pertinent clinical and technical considerations will be discussed in depth to achieve procedural success. In summary, transseptal puncture for left heart structural interventions is feasible in the presence of a prior ASD/patent foramen ovale closure device. A detailed understanding of the anatomical considerations as well as the use of multimodality imaging to evaluate the IAS will aid in improving procedural success rates.  "

Contribution of single-gene defects to congenital cardiac left-sided lesions in the prenatal setting.  ;OBJECTIVES: To explore the contribution of single-gene defects to the genetic cause of cardiac left-sided lesions (LSLs), and to evaluate the incremental diagnostic yield of whole-exome sequencing (WES) for single-gene defects in fetuses with LSLs without aneuploidy or a pathogenic copy-number variant (pCNV). METHODS: Between 10 April 2015 and 30 October 2018, we recruited 80 pregnant women diagnosed with a LSL who had termination of pregnancy and genetic testing. Eligible LSLs were aortic valve atresia or stenosis, coarctation of the aorta, mitral atresia or stenosis and hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS). CNV sequencing (CNV-seq) and WES were performed sequentially on specimens from these fetuses and their parents. CNV-seq was used to identify aneuploidies and pCNVs, while WES was used to identify diagnostic genetic variants in cases without aneuploidy or pCNV. RESULTS: Of 80 pregnancies included in the study, 27 (33.8%) had a genetic diagnosis. CNV-seq analysis identified six (7.5%) fetuses with aneuploidy and eight (10.0%) with pCNVs. WES analysis of the remaining 66 cases revealed diagnostic genetic variants in 13 (19.7%) cases, indicating that the diagnostic yield of WES for the entire cohort was 16.3% (13/80). KMT2D was the most frequently mutated gene (7/66 (10.6%)) in fetuses with LSL without aneuploidy or pCNVs, followed by NOTCH1 (4/66 (6.1%)). HLHS was the most prevalent cardiac phenotype (4/7) in cases with a KMT2D mutation in this cohort. An additional six (9.1%) cases were found to have potentially deleterious variants in candidate genes. CONCLUSIONS: Single-gene defects contribute substantially to the genetic etiology of fetal LSLs. KMT2D mutations accounted for approximately 10% of LSLs in our fetal cohort. WES has the potential to provide genetic diagnoses in fetuses with LSLs without aneuploidy or pCNVs.

Direct Oral Anticoagulant Use After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: A Case Series.  ;BACKGROUND: Use of an anticoagulant after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has been increasing in practice after noted leaflet thrombosis on dual antiplatelet therapy. As the use of anticoagulation increases so does the number of poor warfarin candidates or warfarin intolerant patients. While direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) use is increasing for other indications, there is a paucity of data for use after TAVR. The objective of this case series is to add to the available evidence for patients who may require a DOAC after TAVR. METHODS: A single-center, retrospective observational case series was conducted including adults 18 years of age and older who received a DOAC after TAVR between November 2008 and June 2018 at Mayo Clinic Hospital-Rochester. All patients were identified as part of the Society of Thoracic Surgeons database. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients were identified as having received a DOAC after TAVR. Median age was 83.5 years (interquartile range 77-87), with 71% males. Within this cohort, 20 patients (95.2%) had an alternative indication for anticoagulation of either atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. Apixaban was prescribed in 66.7% of patients, followed by rivaroxaban (14.3%), dabigatran (9.5%), and edoxaban (4.8%). No thromboembolic events were reported. Three patients experienced a bleeding event, of which only 2 occurred in the 3 months immediately after TAVR. CONCLUSIONS: DOAC therapy after TAVR was generally safe and well tolerated. Taken in context of other retrospective studies, these data suggest that the presence of valvular heart disease, specifically TAVR in this case, should not preclude the use of DOACs.  
Three-dimensional printing in adult cardiovascular medicine for surgical and transcatheter procedural planning, teaching and technological innovation.  ;Three-dimensional (3D)-printing technologies in cardiovascular surgery have provided a new way to tailor surgical and percutaneous treatments. Digital information from standard cardiac imaging is integrated into physical 3D models for an accurate spatial visualization of anatomical details. We reviewed the available literature and analysed the different printing technologies, the required procedural steps for 3D prototyping, the used cardiac imaging, the available materials and the clinical implications. We have highlighted different materials used to replicate aortic and mitral valves, vessels and myocardial properties. 3D printing allows a heuristic approach to investigate complex cardiovascular diseases, and it is a unique patient-specific technology providing enhanced understanding and tactile representation of cardiovascular anatomies for the procedural planning and decision-making process. 3D printing may also be used for medical education and surgical/transcatheter training. Communication between doctors and patients can also benefit from 3D models by improving the patient understanding of pathologies. Furthermore, medical device development and testing can be performed with rapid 3D prototyping. Additionally, widespread application of 3D printing in the cardiovascular field combined with tissue engineering will pave the way to 3D-bioprinted tissues for regenerative medicinal applications and 3D-printed organs.  
Prognostic implications of left ventricular global longitudinal strain in patients with bicuspid aortic valve disease and preserved left ventricular ejection fraction.  ;"AIMS: In patients with bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) and preserved left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF), the frequency of impaired LV global longitudinal strain (GLS) and its prognostic implications are unknown. The present study evaluated the proportion and prognostic value of impaired LV GLS in patients with BAV and preserved LVEF. METHODS AND RESULTS: Five hundred and thirteen patients (68% men; mean age 44 ± 18 years) with BAV and preserved LVEF (>50%) were divided into five groups according to the type of BAV dysfunction: (i) normal function BAV, (ii) mild aortic stenosis (AS) or aortic regurgitation (AR), (iii) ≥moderate isolated AS, (iv) ≥moderate isolated AR, and (v) ≥moderate mixed AS and AR. LV systolic dysfunction based on 2D speckle-tracking echocardiography was defined as a cut-off value of LVGLS (-13.6%). The primary outcome was aortic valve intervention or all-cause mortality. The proportion of patients with LVGLS ≤-13.6% was the highest in the normal BAV group (97%) and the lowest in the group with moderate and severe mixed AS and AR (79%). During a median follow-up of 10 years, 210 (41%) patients underwent aortic valve replacement and 17 (3%) died. Patients with preserved LV systolic function (LVGLS ≤ -13.6%) had significantly better event-free survival compared to those with impaired LV systolic function (LVGLS > -13.6%). LVGLS was independently associated with increased risk of events (mainly aortic valve replacement): hazard ratio 1.09; P < 0.001. CONCLUSION: Impaired LVGLS in BAV with preserved LVEF is not infrequent and was independently associated with increased risk of events (mainly aortic valve replacement events).  "
Short-term decrease of left atrial size predicts clinical outcome in patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing TAVR.  ;"OBJECTIVES: We investigated whether transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) results in a short-term decrease in left atrium (LA) size and whether such decrease may predict patients' clinical outcome. BACKGROUND: Increased LA size is a hallmark of severe aortic stenosis (AS) and is associated with adverse patients' cardiovascular outcome. Whether TAVR may lead to a decrease in LA size is not known. METHODS AND RESULTS: Hundred and four patients with severe symptomatic AS and dilated LA undergoing TAVR were enrolled. LA volume was assessed by echocardiography before and shortly after TAVR (median time: 7 days). Composite rate of death and hospitalization for acutely decompensated heart failure (HF) was recorded and clinical status was assessed through NYHA-class evaluation at 12 months median follow-up. After TAVR, 49 patients (47%) demonstrated a decrease in LA volume. Despite a similar baseline NYHA class, patients with decrease in LA size had significant better improvement in clinical status respect to patients with unvaried LA size (NYHA post: 1.2 ± 0.6 vs. 1.8 ± 1.1, p = .001; NYHA reduction: -1.6 ± 0.9 vs. -0.9 ± 1.0, p = .002, respectively). Moreover, these patients had a significantly reduced rate of death or HF-hospitalization (4 vs. 29%, p = .001) and a significantly longer event-free-survival from Kaplan-Meier curves (p = .003). COX regression analysis showed that, among echocardiographic parameters, decrease in LA size was an independent predictor of clinical outcome (HR: 0.149, CI: 0.034-0.654, p = .012). CONCLUSIONS: The lack of decrease in LA size shortly after TAVR is associated with significantly higher rates of death and HF-hospitalization, as well as with impaired improvement in clinical status during long-term follow-up.

Comparison of transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography for transcatheter aortic valve replacement sizing in high-risk patients.  ;BACKGROUND: Untreated symptomatic high-grade aortic stenosis remains a lethal disease requiring individually adapted valve replacement. High-risk surgical patients benefit from transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), but there is no uniform standard for patient selection and valve sizing and it is still unclear whether transthoracic (TTE) or transesophageal (TEE) echocardiography is superior in preprocedural aortic annulus sizing. As preprocedural sizing of the native aortic annulus diameter is crucial to outcome and survival, we report the results of a direct comparison between preprocedural sizing with TTE and TEE including subsequent outcomes in a high-risk TAVR population. METHODS: A total of 149 TAVR patients were enrolled for TTE and TEE comparison, and an additional 15 patients without structural heart disease were investigated as control group to determine the influence of aortic valve calcification on TTE and TEE aortic annulus diameter measurements. RESULTS: Overall standardized TTE and TEE measurements for aortic annulus sizing showed excellent correlation at good image quality (p < 0.01, r = 0.934). Calcification of the aortic annulus diameter was not found to exert a noteworthy negative influence on measurements for both standardized TTE and TEE and complication rates did not differ for mortality, periprocedural stroke and paraprosthetic regurgitation. CONCLUSIONS: Transthoracic echocardiography and TEE are both equally suitable methods of preprocedural aortic annulus size evaluation in preparation of TAVR procedures.

Functional characterization of a novel PBX1 de novo missense variant identified in a patient with syndromic congenital heart disease.  ;Pre-B cell leukemia factor 1 (PBX1) is an essential developmental transcription factor, mutations in which have recently been associated with CAKUTHED syndrome, characterized by multiple congenital defects including congenital heart disease (CHD). During analysis of a whole-exome-sequenced cohort of heterogeneous CHD patients, we identified a de novo missense variant, PBX1:c.551G>C p.R184P, in a patient with tetralogy of Fallot with absent pulmonary valve and extra-cardiac phenotypes. Functional analysis of this variant by creating a CRISPR-Cas9 gene-edited mouse model revealed multiple congenital anomalies. Congenital heart defects (persistent truncus arteriosus and ventricular septal defect), hypoplastic lungs, hypoplastic/ectopic kidneys, aplastic adrenal glands and spleen, as well as atretic trachea and palate defects were observed in the homozygous mutant embryos at multiple stages of development. We also observed developmental anomalies in a proportion of heterozygous embryos, suggestive of a dominant mode of inheritance. Analysis of gene expression and protein levels revealed that although Pbx1 transcripts are higher in homozygotes, amounts of PBX1 protein are significantly decreased. Here, we have presented the first functional model of a missense PBX1 variant and provided strong evidence that p.R184P is disease-causal. Our findings also expand the phenotypic spectrum associated with pathogenic PBX1 variants in both humans and mice.

Surgical options in rheumatic heart disease: an Indian surgeon's perspective.  ;Rheumatic heart disease is the primary cause of valvular heart disease in India and other Southeast Asian countries. The disease is quite different from that seen in France, USA, and Australia. Poverty, malnutrition, and delayed referral affect the outcomes. Rheumatic heart disease can affect all four heart valves, mitral being the most common, aortic second, tricuspid next, and finally the pulmonary valve. The combinations of mitral and aortic, mitral and tricuspid, and all three valves are the next in frequency. Acute rheumatic fever usually manifests as quadrivalvular involvement. However, chronic rheumatic quadrivalvular heart disease has also been reported. The technical aspects taught and practiced in one institution over the past four decades are described here. Closed mitral valvotomy, mitral valve repair, or replacement with mechanical, bioprosthetic, and autograft valves are the choices. Aortic valve disease is usually treated with valve repair or replacement with mechanical, homograft or pulmonary autograft valves.  
A contemporary and complete treatment solution for a high-risk patient with critical aortic stenosis, left ventricular thrombus, severe left ventricular dysfunction, and calcified left main stem disease.  ;The combination of severe coronary disease, significant valvular dysfunction and impaired ventricular function pose patients at a very high procedural risk. In addition, the presence of left ventricular thrombus can complicate ventricular instrumentation increasing embolic risk. Contemporary techniques and devices have now become available to overcome these challenges to reduce risk and allow safer, more efficient procedures. We describe the feasibility of using Impella CP™ with cerebral protection to facilitate complete revascularisation and percutaneous valve replacement in a patient with critical aortic stenosis, severe left ventricular (LV) impairment, LV thrombus and a calcified left main stem disease.  
Retrieval of a MitraClip from the left atrium using a two-snare technique: Case report and review of the literature.  ;MitraClip is used for reduction of mitral insufficiency in patients who are not good surgical candidates, but with expanding indications, the use of MitraClip and the number of complications will increase. Here is presented a case of a single leaflet device attachment that worsened the patient's mitral insufficiency, as well as the technique for stabilizing the valve followed by retrieval of the device. A special focus is placed on removing the using a two-snare technique to avoid the need for a surgical cutdown and repair.  
Seismocardiography and 4D flow MRI reveal impact of aortic valve replacement on chest acceleration and aortic hemodynamics.  ;Aortic valve replacement (AVR) is a common treatment for severe aortic valve disease, which can adversely affect blood flow in the aorta. Seismocardiography (SCG) measures physical vibrations at the exterior of the chest, which can be sensitive to altered cardiac function and flow dynamics. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can image blood movement, and it can provide depiction and quantification of aortic flow. Here we present SCG and MRI measurements from before and after AVR and ascending aorta replacement, in the case of a woman with bicuspid aortic valve disease and a dilated ascending aorta. SCG measurements show elevated energy during systole indicating stenotic flow before surgery and lowered systolic energy levels after replacement with a prosthetic valve. MRI shows jetting, helical flow before surgery, and cohesive flow after.  
Conservative management of a rare case of atrial septal hematoma after pediatric cardiac surgery.  ;Atrial septal hematoma is uncommon complication that may happen after any cardiac intervention. Although it is rare, it can pose a challenging situation in the postoperative care. Multiple management approaches has been described with different outcomes. Here we are reporting a boy, aged 13 years, with dilated aortic root who underwent aortic root replacement with valve preservation. Postoperative course was complicated by atrial septal hematoma. A nonsurgical management approach was chosen based on the patient clinical condition. Regression in size with complete resolution of the hematoma was observed during the follow up.

Outcomes of three different new generation transcatheter aortic valve prostheses.  ;AIMS: To evaluate outcomes of transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TF-TAVI) using three different new-generation devices. BACKGROUND: Although new generation transcatheter aortic valves (TAVs) have demonstrated to improve procedural outcomes, to date few head-to-head comparisons are available among these devices. METHODS: This is a single center, retrospective study. From September 2014 to February 2018, 389 patients underwent elective TF-TAVI for native, severe aortic stenosis using a new-generation transcatheter aortic valve (TAV) with a preprocedural multi-detector computed tomography assessment. Among these, 346 patients received an Edwards SAPIEN 3 (n = 134), Medtronic Evolut R (n = 111), or Boston ACURATE neo (n = 101) prosthesis. Differences in baseline clinical characteristics between groups were accounted using the propensity score weighting method. RESULTS: The mean age for the entire study cohort was 81.4 ± 5.2 years while the Society of Thoracic Surgery predicted risk of mortality was 4.0 ± 2.5%. After propensity score weighting adjustment, TAVs did not differently impact on 30-day all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. Evolut R device showed an increased risk of permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI) after the procedure (8.3% for SAPIEN 3 vs. 16.7% for Evolut R vs. 2.1% for ACURATE neo, p < .05). At 30 days, patients treated with SAPIEN 3 valve showed a higher mean transvalvular gradient (9.7 ± 7.5 mmHg vs. 6.1 ± 2.4 mmHg vs. 8.4 ± 3.5 mmHg for SAPIEN 3, Evolut R, and ACURATE neo, respectively, p < .01) and a lower rate of more-than-trace paravalvular regurgitation (PVR) (18.8 vs. 47.9 vs. 45.8%, for SAPIEN 3, Evolut R, and ACURATE neo, respectively, p < .01). At 1 year, SAPIEN 3, Evolut R, and ACURATE neo TAVs showed excellent and comparable outcomes with no difference in terms of freedom from major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular event (MACCE) (plog-rank = 0.534). CONCLUSIONS: TAVI using new-generation prostheses was associated with high device success (97.0% vs. 92.8% vs. 95.0% for SAPIEN 3, Evolut R and ACURATE neo, respectively) and low complications rates up to 1 year. Evolut R valve was associated with a higher rate of PPI whereas SAPIEN 3 valve was associated with a higher mean transvalvular gradient and lower rate of more-than-trace PVR. At 1-year, MACCE rates were similar among the three groups.  
Application of transcatheter valves for aortic valve replacement in pediatric patients: A case series.  ;OBJECTIVES: To describe our initial experience with pediatric transcatheter aortic valve replacement. BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has been approved and used to treat calcific aortic stenosis in adult patients. Select pediatric patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) who are poor candidates for conventional surgical aortic valve replacement can benefit from TAVR. METHODS: A retrospective review was performed to identify and describe pediatric patients with CHD who underwent transcatheter or hybrid aortic valve replacement using a Melody Valve (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN), or Sapien S3/XT valve (Edwards Life sciences LLC, Irvine, CA). Patients in whom transcatheter valves were implanted on cardiopulmonary bypass were included. Imaging data, procedural elements, and clinical follow-up data were collected to evaluate acute and short-term results. RESULTS: A total of eight pediatric patients underwent treatment of aortic valvular disease using balloon expandable valves and delivery systems. Two patients had Melody valve implantation and six received a Sapien valve (one XT/five S3). In one patient, a Melody valve was placed surgically, failed, and was replaced with a Sapien valve 2 years later. Two patients were treated using a standard transfemoral route, four had the valve delivered on cardiopulmonary bypass via a median sternotomy, one was placed with a transapical approach, and one via a carotid cut down. Patients were followed for an average 16 months (range 1-208 weeks). There were no early or late deaths in this cohort. There were no embolic events, and all valves worked well in the immediate postoperative period. Both Melody implants developed moderate to severe regurgitation at 2 years and 4 years, respectively, and both required replacement at that time. One Sapien 3 valve developed a paravalvular leak that required reintervention within 6 months of implantation. CONCLUSIONS: Transcatheter valves offer a reasonable alternative to traditional surgical aortic valve replacement in certain pediatric patients who are suboptimal surgical candidates. Hybrid approaches and valve delivery on cardiopulmonary bypass has been used in smaller patients. Long-term performance of these valves in young patients has not been studied.  
Caseous Calcification of the Mitral Annulus: A Role for Surgery.  ;An 80-year-old man followed for aortic stenosis was found to have an intracardiac mass. Multiple imaging modalities were inconclusive in characterizing the mass but raised concerns about the potential malignancy of the mass. Fear of operating on an elderly patient with a potential for cardiac neoplasia led to a percutaneous transseptal biopsy that failed to provide a clear diagnosis. Cardiac valvular surgery was performed in addition to excisional biopsy of the mass that turned out to be caseous necrosis of mitral annular calcifications.

Acute Commissural Rupture in a Giant Aortic Root Aneurysm.  ;Idiopathic rupture of aortic valve commissure is an extremely rare cause of acute aortic regurgitation. Here, we report a case of commissural rupture with giant root aneurysm and history of chronic aortic regurgitation, emphasizing the diagnostic value of high-quality three-dimensional reconstructions of multimodality imaging in assessing the cause of abruptly deteriorating valve regurgitation.  
Histological examination of explanted tissue-engineered bovine pericardium following heart valve repair.  ;OBJECTIVES: Our goal was to present histopathological findings of human explants of a tissue-engineered bovine pericardium CardioCel (Admedus Regen Pty Ltd, Malaga, WA, Australia) used for heart valve repair in patients with congenital and acquired heart valve disease. METHODS: Sixty patients underwent heart valve repair from May 2014 to November 2018 using CardioCel as a substitute for valve tissue. We identified 9 cases in which the CardioCel patch was explanted following valve repair and available for histomorphological analyses. CardioCel explants were evaluated histologically using haematoxylin and oeosin, Elastica van Gieson and immunohistochemical stains. RESULTS: The indications for explantation were related to the CardioCel patch in 6 patients. Median time between the implantation and explantation was 242 (range 3-1247) days. We demonstrated a characteristic remodelling pattern with superficial coating of the tissue-engineered bovine pericardium by granulation tissue composed of histiocytes, few lymphocytes and fibrin. We had 2 cases with a multifocal nodular disruption, fragmentation and sclerosis of the decellularized collagen matrix with focal calcification after 795 and 1247 days in situ. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the tissue-engineered CardioCel patch is initially tolerated in the valvular position in the majority of patients. However, we also experienced graft failures that showed degeneration with fragmentation of the collagen matrix and even 2 cases with focal calcification evident from the histopathological analysis. Further analyses of mid- and long-term performance are mandatory.

The modified Ross Reversal operation: a new approach for preserving the autograft wall.  ;The Ross Reversal operation is a breakthrough strategy first reported by Flynn et al. in 2007. In a reoperation for pulmonary autograft dysfunction after the Ross operation, an excised autograft can be preserved by reusing it in a native pulmonary position. We report a case wherein we used a new approach to excise the autograft valve with less invasion. The patient underwent a modified Ross Reversal operation concomitant with aortic root replacement and recovered without any complications. Our new approach enables a safer operation with improved valve function.  
Fiber Scaffold Patterning for Mending Hearts: 3D Organization Bringing the Next Step.  ;Heart failure (HF) is a leading cause of death worldwide. The most common conditions that lead to HF are coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, valve disorders, high blood pressure, and cardiomyopathy. Due to the limited regenerative capacity of the heart, the only curative therapy currently available is heart transplantation. Therefore, there is a great need for the development of novel regenerative strategies to repair the injured myocardium, replace damaged valves, and treat occluded coronary arteries. Recent advances in manufacturing technologies have resulted in the precise fabrication of 3D fiber scaffolds with high architectural control that can support and guide new tissue growth, opening exciting new avenues for repair of the human heart. This review discusses the recent advancements in the novel research field of fiber patterning manufacturing technologies for cardiac tissue engineering (cTE) and to what extent these technologies could meet the requirements of the highly organized and structured cardiac tissues. Additionally, future directions of these novel fiber patterning technologies, designs, and applicability to advance cTE are presented.

Combining position-based dynamics and gradient vector flow for 4D mitral valve segmentation in TEE sequences.  ;PURPOSE: For planning and guidance of minimally invasive mitral valve repair procedures, 3D+t transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) sequences are acquired before and after the intervention. The valve is then visually and quantitatively assessed in selected phases. To enable a quantitative assessment of valve geometry and pathological properties in all heart phases, as well as the changes achieved through surgery, we aim to provide a new 4D segmentation method. METHODS: We propose a tracking-based approach combining gradient vector flow (GVF) and position-based dynamics (PBD). An open-state surface model of the valve is propagated through time to the closed state, attracted by the GVF field of the leaflet area. The PBD method ensures topological consistency during deformation. For evaluation, one expert in cardiac surgery annotated the closed-state leaflets in 10 TEE sequences of patients with normal and abnormal mitral valves, and defined the corresponding open-state models. RESULTS: The average point-to-surface distance between the manual annotations and the final tracked model was [Formula: see text]. Qualitatively, four cases were satisfactory, five passable and one unsatisfactory. Each sequence could be segmented in 2-6 min. CONCLUSION: Our approach enables to segment the mitral valve in 4D TEE image data with normal and pathological valve closing behavior. With this method, in addition to the quantification of the remaining orifice area, shape and dimensions of the coaptation zone can be analyzed and considered for planning and surgical result assessment.  
Functional tricuspid regurgitation in rheumatic mitral valve disease patients with and without tricuspid annuloplasty: a three-dimensional echocardiography study with one year follow up.  ;The aim of this study is to analyze the clinical and echocardiographic determinants of functional tricuspid regurgitation (TR) before and after surgical intervention of rheumatic mitral valve disease, with focus on effectiveness of different methods of tricuspid valve annuloplasty (TAP). Three-dimensional echocardiographic images were obtained in 170 patients with mitral valve rheumatic disease before and 1 year after mitral valve replacement, with and without concomitant TAP. Together with standard cardiac chamber quantification, multiplanar reconstruction images of the tricuspid valve (TV) apparatus were analyzed in the septal-lateral and antero-posterior directions, end-diastolic TV annular diameter, TV tenting height and tenting area were measured. By multivariate logistic regression, septal-lateral TV tenting area (p < 0.001) were independently correlated with preoperative FTR severity while postoperative septal-lateral TV annular diameter (p < 0.001) independently determined residual TR at 1-year follow-up. Both ring and suture TAP groups had postoperative reduction of S-L TV diameters, but isolated MVR group had an 11% increase in S-L TV diameters. Compared with TAP of size 26 mm and 28 mm rings group, suture TAP group had more common significant residual TR (29% vs. 3%, p = 0.001). Our study demonstrated that ring annuloplasty could provide effective reduction of the TV annulus and prevent postoperative TR progression, and for rheumatic mitral valve disease patients with mild functional TR, prophylactic TAP concomitant with MVR might be considered to address the postoperative TV annulus dilation.

Prognostic value of right ventricular free wall longitudinal strain in a large cohort of outpatients with left-side heart disease.  ;"AIMS: Right ventricular free wall longitudinal strain (RVFWLS) has been proposed as an accurate and sensitive measure of right ventricular function that could integrate other conventional parameters such as tricuspid annulus plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) and fractional area change (FAC%). The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between RVFWLS and outcomes in stable asymptomatic outpatients with left-sided structural heart disease. METHODS AND RESULTS: We enrolled 458 asymptomatic patients with left-side heart diseases and any ejection fraction who were referred for echocardiography to two Italian centres. The composite endpoint of death for any cause and heart failure hospitalization was used as primary outcome of this analysis. After a mean follow-up of 5.4 ± 1.2 years, 145 patients (31%) reached the combined endpoint. Most of echocardiographic parameters were related to outcomes, including right ventricular functional parameters. Mean value of RVFWLS in our cohort was -21 ± 8% and it was significantly related to the combined endpoint and in multivariable Cox-regression model; when tested with other echocardiographic parameters that were significantly related to outcome at univariate analysis, RVFWLS maintained its independent association with outcome (hazard ratio 0.963, 95% confidence interval 0.948-0.978; P = 0.0001). The best cut-off value of RVFWLS to predict outcome was -22% (area under the curve 0.677; P < 0.001; sensitivity 70%; 65% specificity). CONCLUSION: RVFWLS may help clinicians to identify patients with left-sided structural heart disease at higher risk for first heart failure hospitalization and death for any cause.  "

Repair of Pectus Excavatum at the Time of Reoperative Cardiac Surgery.  ;Severe pectus excavatum at the time of redo cardiac surgery presents unique challenges for sternal reentry and reconstruction. We present the case of a 14-year-old boy with tetralogy of Fallot, prior transannular patch repair, and severe pectus excavatum who presented for pulmonary valve replacement and pectus repair. A modified Ravitch procedure with subperichondrial resection of the costal cartilages allowed for sternal mobilization, safe reentry, and excellent reconstruction. This is a safe and reproducible technique for dealing with the challenging scenario of severe pectus excavatum in patients undergoing redo cardiac surgery.  
Repair of Less Than Severe Tricuspid Regurgitation During Left-Sided Valve Surgery: A Meta-Analysis.  ;"BACKGROUND: This systematic review and meta-analysis was undertaken to investigate the short- and long-term clinical outcomes of concurrent repair of mild or moderate tricuspid regurgitation (TR) during left-sided valve surgery. METHODS: Medline, PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Libraries were searched, and 12 studies were identified, comprising 1373 patients who underwent TR repair during left-sided valve surgery and 1553 patients who did not. Of these studies, 6 were classified as having a low risk of bias (randomized controlled trials or propensity-matched studies), and 6 were considered as having a high risk of bias (nonmatched observational studies). The primary analysis included only studies with a low risk of bias (399 repair and 426 nonrepair). RESULTS: Primary analysis of studies at low risk of bias demonstrated that the addition of TR repair compared with nonrepair was associated with reduced risks of cardiovascular mortality, all-cause mortality, and progression of TR over a median of 5.3 years of follow-up (cardiovascular mortality: relative risk [RR], 0.46; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.28 to 0.75; P = .002; all-cause mortality: RR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.49 to 0.96; P = .03; and TR progression: RR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.12 to 0.56; P < .001). Cardiopulmonary bypass time was significantly shorter in the nonrepair group (mean weighted difference, 18 minutes; 95% CI, 6 to 30; P = .003), although the risk of perioperative mortality was comparable between the 2 groups (RR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.27 to 1.97; P > .05). CONCLUSIONS: Concurrent repair of mild or moderate TR during left-sided valve surgery is associated with improved long-term clinical outcomes without adversely affecting early survival. Should these results be validated by ongoing trials, there should be a revision of current guidelines to recommend a more aggressive approach toward TR repair.  "

In-Hospital Postoperative Atrial Fibrillation Indicates a Poorer Clinical Outcome after Myectomy for Obstructive Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy.  ;"OBJECTIVES: This study aims to investigate the risk factors of in-hospital postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) and the impact of POAF on the clinical outcome in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) patients who underwent myectomy. METHODS: Data from a total of 494 obstructive HCM patients, who had undergone preoperative cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) testing and who underwent myectomy at Fuwai Hospital from June 2011 to June 2016, were collected. RESULTS: Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that old age (odds ratio [OR], 4.326; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.248-8.325; p <0.001), maximal left atrium volume (LAV) (OR, 1.137; 95% CI, 1.075-1.202; p <0.001), and hypertension (OR, 2.754; 95% CI, 1.262-6.007; p = 0.011) were associated with the incidence of POAF. In the patients without preoperative AF, Cox regression analysis demonstrated that POAF (p = 0.002), decreased left atrium (LA) ejection fraction (LAEF) (p = 0.036), concomitant procedure (p = 0.039), and postoperative residual moderate or severe mitral valve regurgitation (p = 0.030) were independent predictors of composite cardiovascular events. CONCLUSIONS: POAF indicated a poorer clinical outcome after myectomy for obstructive HCM patients, which was similar to those with preoperative AF. Elevated LAV was independently related to POAF onset in HCM patients who underwent myectomy.  "
Challenges of recognizing bicuspid aortic valve in elderly patients undergoing TAVR.  ;"Recognition of bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) may be challenging in elderly patients with heavily calcified aortic valves undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). In this subset, the diagnostic value of pre-procedural echocardiography in clinical routine is unknown. From a total of 2583 patients undergoing TAVR in our center, we determined the rate of BAV detected by routine echocardiography as documented in the medical records. Pre-procedural multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) images were retrospectively analyzed for the presence of BAV and served as reference standard. Using MDCT criteria, BAV was found in 235 (9.1%) (age 80.1 years [interquartile range 76.4; 83.4], 44.3% female). Of these, only 27/235 (11.5%) had been identified as BAV according to echocardiography reports, whereas 6/2348 (0.3%) with TAV had been wrongly diagnosed as BAV (p < 0.001; sensitivity 11.5%, specificity 99.7%). Correct diagnosis of BAV by echocardiography was more likely when transesophageal echocardiography was available (odds ratio (OR) 5.12 [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.22; 11.80]; p < 0.001) and the reader was experienced (OR 5.28 [95% CI 1.55; 18.04]; p = 0.008). Furthermore, correct diagnosis of BAV was more likely in bicommissural-type BAV (OR 2.22 [95% CI 0.90; 5.48]; p = 0.08), whereas heavy aortic valve calcification lead to misdiagnosis (OR 0.39 [95% CI 0.14; 1.06]; p = 0.07). In elderly patients with severe aortic stenosis that are candidates for TAVR, the presence of BAV may be considerably underestimated when relying solely on routine echocardiography. This underlines the value of MDCT for the screening of BAV in this patient population.  "

Novel Trigone-Based Sizing Method for Mitral Ring Annuloplasty.  ;"BACKGROUND: We devised a novel trigone-based sizing method, setting the trigones at one-quarter of the annular circumference, and used it for mitral annuloplasty in patients with mitral regurgitation (MR). METHODS: Between 1999 and 2017, 436 patients with degenerative (n = 192), nonischemic functional (n = 124), or ischemic (n = 120) MR underwent mitral valvuloplasty at our institution using an incomplete ring. The intertrigonal distance and prerepair and postrepair annular diameter were measured. Then the diameters predicted from body surface area, the intertrigonal distance, and the ratios of these diameters to observed data were computed. We investigated the influence of these measurements on MR recurrence, transmitral pressure gradient, and systolic anterior motion. RESULTS: Initial repair was successful in 433 patients (99%), but 3 patients with systolic anterior motion and MR required conversion to valve replacement. After 1, 5, and 10 years (mean follow-up, 6.3 years), the rate of freedom from grade 2 or higher recurrent MR was 96%, 92%, and 86% in the degenerative group, 99%, 97%, and 90% in the nonischemic functional group, and 95%, 90%, and 79%, respectively, in the ischemic group (P = .052). The observed/body surface area predicted diameter ratio was negatively correlated with the mean transmitral pressure gradient (mm Hg); 12.3 - 8.2 × (ratio) (R = -0.37, P < .001), despite a smaller ratio (<0.9) not being associated with less recurrence of MR. In the degenerative group, systolic anterior motion developed in 7 of 71 patients (10%) with an observed/intertrigonal distance predicted diameter ratio of less than 0.9 (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Our trigone-based sizing method achieved satisfactory control of MR, while avoiding functional mitral stenosis and systolic anterior motion.  "
Black-blood cinematic rendering: A new method for cardiac CT intraluminal visualization.  ;BACKGROUND: Cinematic rendering (CR) is a method of generating photorealistic 3D images from volumetric computed tomography (CT) data. In this manuscript, we describe a CR preset we have termed black-blood cinematic rendering (BBCR) that allows for detailed endoluminal views of the heart. METHODS: Three recent chest CT scans were retrospectively selected as representative examples for BBCR visualization. All scans had been performed with our institution's clinical standard, post-contrast, cardiac-gated chest CT. The BBCR images were created from isotropic-voxel reconstructed volumetric data on a stand-alone workstation. RESULTS: The BBCR technique was successfully utilized to demonstrate intraluminal cardiac findings in a patient with a normal left ventricle, a patient with a left ventricular mural thrombus, and a patient status-post transcatheter aortic valve replacement. CONCLUSIONS: BBCR is a new method of utilizing volumetric chest CT data in order to provide detailed images of intraluminal anatomy and pathology of the heart. Further study of this promising method is warranted.

Chronic oral anticoagluation and risk of prostate cancer: Evidence of detection bias.  ;"Warfarin treatment has been associated with lower risks of prostate cancer, without a specified biological mechanism. Our study tested the hypothesis that reluctance to perform prostate biopsies in men who are anticoagulated results in lower rates of diagnosed prostate cancer, leading to an apparent protective effect. Rates of prostate biopsies have decreased from 2000 to 2015, allowing calendar time to be used as the intervention. In a national population-based sample of elderly men, our study compared trends in prostate cancer incidence between 17,815 men treated with chronic oral anticoagulation for prosthetic heart valve thromboprophylaxis and a general population comparison group of 356,300 men. Cancer events were based on administrative claims. Among men enrolled in 2000-2001 and followed through 2015, prostate cancer incidence was substantially lower in the anticoagulation group (adjusted incidence rate ratio [IRR] 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.62-0.80). Incidence decreased over time in the general population group to approach that of the anticoagulation group among men enrolled in 2008-2010 (IRR 0.86; 95% CI 0.71-1.04). Rates of prostate biopsies also decreased over time in the general population group to match the rate in the anticoagulation group. These results indicate that the apparent protective effect of warfarin treatment on the risk of prostate cancer is likely the result of detection bias from lower rates of biopsies among men who are anticoagulated.

Contemporary epidemiology and outcomes in recurrent infective endocarditis.  ;OBJECTIVE: Recurrent infective endocarditis (IE) is a major complication of patients surviving a first episode of IE. This study sought to analyse the current state of recurrent IE in a large contemporary cohort. METHODS: 1335 consecutive episodes of IE were recruited prospectively in three tertiary care centres in Spain between 1996 and 2015. Episodes were categorised into group I (n=1227), first-IE episode and group II (n=108), recurrent IE (8.1%). After excluding six patients, due to lack of relevant data, group II was subdivided into IIa (n=87), reinfection (different microorganism), and IIb (n=15), relapse (same microorganism within 6 months of the initial episode). RESULTS: The cumulative burden and incidence of recurrence was slightly lower in the second decade of the study (2006-2015) (7.17 vs 4.10 events/100 survivors and 7.51% vs 3.82, respectively). Patients with reinfections, compared with group I, were significantly younger, had a higher frequency of HIV infection, were more commonly intravenous drug users (IVDU) and prosthetic valve carriers, had less embolic complications and cardiac surgery, with similar in-hospital mortality. IVDU was found to be an independent predictor of reinfection (HR 3.92, 95% CI 1.86 to 8.28).In the relapse IE group, prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) and periannular complications were more common. Among patients treated medically, those with PVE had a higher relapse incidence (4.82% vs 0.43% in native valve IE, p=0.018). Staphylococcus aureus and PVE were independent predictors of relapse (HR 3.14, 95% CI 1.11 to 8.86 and 3.19, 95% CI 1.13 to 9.00, respectively) and in-hospital-mortality was similar to group I. Three-year all-cause mortality was similar in recurrent episodes compared with single episodes. CONCLUSION: Recurrent IE remains a frequent late complication. IVDU was associated with a fourfold increase in the risk of reinfection. PVE treated medically and infections caused by S. aureus increased the risk of relapse. In-hospital and long-term mortality was comparable among groups.  
Right Ventricle-Dependent Coronary Circulation: Location of Obstruction Is Associated With Survival.  ;"BACKGROUND: Pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum (PAIVS) with right ventricle-dependent coronary circulation (RVDCC) carries suboptimal outcomes primarily due to cardiac ischemia. We hypothesize clinical outcomes are affected by the level of coronary obstruction, a surrogate for vulnerable myocardium. METHODS: We conducted a single-institution retrospective analysis of all neonates with PAIVS with RVDCC from 1995 to 2017. RVDCC was defined as the presence of any coronary-cameral fistula with coronary obstruction proximal to the fistula and angiographic evidence of RV perfusion of the myocardium through the fistulous communication. Location of coronary obstruction was categorized as either proximal or distal segments, using the SYNTAX score criteria. Transplant-free survival was compared between patients with proximal and distal obstruction, then these groups were compared with patients without RVDCC. RESULTS: Of 103 neonates with PAIVS, 28 (27%) had RVDCC: 18 proximal (64%), 10 distal (36%). Median age at last follow-up for patients with RVDCC was 1.8 years (interquartile range, 0.3-8.1 years). All deaths (10 of 28, 36%) occurred at 6 months old or earlier. Proximal coronary artery obstruction was associated with decreased transplant-free survival relative to distal obstruction (hazard ratio = 3.63; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-13.00; P = .048). Transplant-free survival at 1 year was 33% and 70% in the proximal and distal obstruction groups, respectively. Compared with patients without RVDCC, patients with proximal obstruction had significantly lower transplant-free survival (P < .001), whereas patients with distal obstruction did not (P = .217). CONCLUSIONS: The location of coronary artery obstruction affects clinical outcome and may represent a potential branch point in the management for PAIVS with RVDCC.  "

Rare case of iatrogenic aortic valve leaflet tear following a diagnostic coronary angiogram.  ;We report a rare case of a 44-year-old male who underwent a diagnostic coronary angiogram following a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction complicated by an aortic valve leaflet tear requiring surgical intervention. Routine transthoracic echocardiogram demonstrated a mobile echogenic structure prolapsing into the left ventricular outflow tract. An intraoperative transesophageal echocardiogram confirmed that the structure originated from the ventricular side of left coronary cusp, causing malcoaptation between left and right coronary cusps, and subsequent moderate to severe aortic regurgitation.

Three-dimensional echocardiographic comparison of left ventricular geometry and systolic function between dilated cardiomyopathy and mitral regurgitation with similar left ventricular dilation.  ;"PURPOSE: This study aimed to analyze left ventricular (LV) remodeling in patients with LV dilation using three-dimensional (3D) echocardiography, and to compare geometry and systolic function between patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and with mitral regurgitation (MR) but similar LV dimension. METHODS: Cross-sectional study of 60 DCM and 60 MR patients with LV end diastolic diameter (LVEDD) > 35 mm/m2 , and of 60 healthy control volunteers. RESULTS: Despite a similar LVEDD, DCM patients showed a significantly higher 3D sphericity index (3D-SI) than MR patients, whereas 3D ejection fraction (3D-EF) was significantly lower (P < .01). There was a linear relationship between 3D-EF and 3D-SI in both DCM and MR patients (r = -0. 745 and r = -0. 642, respectively; both P < .001). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves showed that 3D-SI had could better discriminate between DCM and MR (sensitivity 90%; specificity 73%; AUC 0.852, P < .01) than other variables. The area under the ROC curve of 3D-SI was significantly larger than that of 3D-EF for detecting heart failure in both patients with DCM and MR. CONCLUSIONS: LV geometry appears to be more spherical and associated with worse systolic function in DCM than in MR patients, in spite of similar LV dimensions. Systolic function correlated significantly with 3D-SI, which provided a better description of LV remodeling and could be a stronger indicator of heart failure in patients with LV dilation.  "

Impact of right ventricular volumes on the outcomes of TAVR: a volumetric analysis of preprocedural computed tomography.  ;AIMS: The aim of this study was to assess the prognostic implications of increased right ventricle volume index (RVVI) using cardiac-gated computed tomography angiography (CCTA) data among patients undergoing transcatheter valve replacement (TAVR). METHODS AND RESULTS: CCTA of 323 patients who underwent TAVR at Stanford University Medical Center (CA, USA) and Tel Aviv Medical Center (Israel) between 2013 and 2016 was analysed by an automatic four-chamber volumetric software and grouped into quartiles according to RVVI. Higher one-year mortality rates were noted for the upper quartiles - 5%, 4.9%, 8.6%, and 16% (p=0.039), in Q1 <59 ml/m2, Q2 59-69 ml/m2, Q3 69-86 ml/m2, and Q4 >86 ml/m2, respectively. However, the differences were not significant after propensity score adjustments. Sub-analyses of Q1 demonstrated an escalating risk for one-year mortality in concordance to RVVI: HR 2.28, HR 2.76, and HR 4.7, for the upper 25th, 15th, and 5th percentiles, respectively (p<0.05 for all comparisons). After propensity score adjustments for clinical and echocardiographic characteristics, only the upper 5th percentiles (RVVI >120 ml/m2) retained statistical significance (HR 2.82, 95% CI: 1.02-7.78, p=0.045). Notably, 68.7% of patients from this group were considered low-intermediate risk for surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac volumetric data by CCTA performed for procedural planning may help to predict outcome in patients undergoing TAVR.  
Early haemodynamic changes and long-term outcome of patients with severe low-gradient aortic stenosis after transcatheter aortic valve replacement.  ;"AIMS: Approximately 40% of severe aortic stenosis (AS) patients have a low-gradient (<40 mmHg) AS (LG-AS). The aim of this study was to investigate the invasively measured haemodynamic changes and long-term outcome after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in the subgroups of LG-AS. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 600 LG-AS patients with haemodynamic assessment by left and right heart catheterisation were divided into three groups: normal-flow (NFLG-AS; n=296), paradoxical low-flow (PLFLG-AS; n=153), and classic low-flow (CLFLG-AS; n=151). Post TAVR, PLFLG-AS and CLFLG-AS showed a significant reduction in global afterload (p<0.005), as well as a significant elevation of stroke volume index (SVI), and left and right ventricular stroke work index (p<0.001). NFLG-AS was associated with an elevation of global afterload and a decrease of SVI (p<0.05). Overall survival was highest in NFLG-AS, followed by PLFLG-AS and CLFLG-AS. All subgroups experienced similar symptomatic improvement. CONCLUSIONS: NFLG-AS was the most prevalent form of LG severe AS and was associated with adequate left ventricular compensation and good prognosis. On the other hand, CLFLG-AS represents the heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) form of AS and was associated with the worst prognosis, whereas PLFLG-AS represents the heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) form of AS with intermediate prognosis. Both groups showed early haemodynamic reverse response after TAVR.  "

Functional characterization and circulating expression profile of dysregulated microRNAs in BAV-associated aortopathy.  ;"Compelling evidence has shown that microRNAs (miRs) are involved in the pathophysiology of BAV-associated aortopathy. The purpose of this study was to assess the biological role as well as the circulating expression of two miRs (miR-424-3p and miR-3688-3p) that have been previously identified as significantly dysregulated in thoracic aortic aneurysm specimens of BAV patients. Bioinformatic tools were used to predict miR gene targets followed by functional validation transfecting synthetic miR mimics and negative controls into human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs). Levels of miRs and target genes were evaluated by qRT-PCR. The circulating miR expression profile analysis was assessed on plasma samples collected from a cohort of 72 patients with aortopathy including 39 BAV (33 males; 58 ± 13 years) and 33 TAV patients (26 males; 67 ± 9 years). Computational analysis revealed that SMAD7 and YAP1 were potential targets of miR-424-3p and miR-3688-3p, respectively. Transfection with mimics confirmed a significantly decreased gene expression of SMAD7 and YAP1 compared to mimic negative control (p = 0.04 and p = 0.0005, respectively) or blank control (p = 0.01 and p = 0.0007, respectively). Overexpression of miR-3688-3p also significantly upregulated pro-apoptotic caspase-3 gene expression compared to mimic negative control (p = 0.02) or blank control (p = 0.01). Furthermore, a significant down-regulation of the circulating miR-424-3p was observed in BAV compared to TAV patients (p = 0.001). In multiple linear regression analysis, the aortic valve morphology (β = - 0.29, p = 0.04) and the presence of aortic stenosis (β = - 0.28, p = 0.03) had a significant effect on the miR-424-3p expression. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that miR-424-3p and miR-3688-3p directly targeted SMAD7 and YAP1 in HASMCs, pivotal genes of the TGF-β and Hippo-signaling pathways. Circulating miR-424-3p was also found to be significantly decreased in BAV patients when compared to TAV patients, especially in patients with aortic stenosis. Further large studies of well-characterized BAV patient cohorts are needed to define the clinical significance of the miR-424-3p.  "

Outcomes of Conventional Cardiac Surgery in Patients With Severely Reduced Ejection Fraction in the Modern Era.  ;BACKGROUND: This study evaluates the outcomes of conventional cardiac surgery in patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 25% or less. METHODS: Patients with preoperative low LVEF (25% or less) undergoing The Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) indexed cardiac operations from 2010 to 2018 were included. The primary outcome was survival. Secondary outcomes included major postoperative complications and readmission rates. Multivariable Cox regression was utilized for risk adjustment. Subanalyses evaluated the effect of preoperative inotropes as well as the impact of low LVEF on survival and readmission compared with propensity matched patients with LVEF greater than 25%. RESULTS: In all, 9467 patients underwent STS-indexed cardiac operations during the study period, including 588 with LVEF of 25% or less. The low LVEF group included 397 (67.5%) isolated coronary artery bypass graft, 51 (8.67%) isolated valve, and 140 (23.8%) concomitant coronary artery bypass graft and valve operations. Survival of low LVEF patients was not affected by operative procedure but instead by traditional risk factors such as advanced age and medical comorbidities. Freedom from hospital readmission for heart failure was 57.2% at 5-year follow-up. Patients receiving preoperative inotropes had reduced survival, although the majority were still alive at 5 years (53.1% vs 64.9%, P = .002). In addition, propensity matched patients with LVEF 25% or less and LVEF greater than 25% had similar survival and hazards for mortality at 30-day, 1-year, and 5-year follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a high-risk profile, patients with reduced preoperative LVEF can undergo conventional cardiac surgery with acceptable outcomes. The majority of patients, including those receiving preoperative inotropes, were alive and free from heart failure readmissions at 5 years.

Moderate ischemic mitral incompetence: does it worth more ischemic time?  ;OBJECTIVES: Ischemic mitral regurgitation (IMR) is a common finding following myocardial infarction or ischemia. Management of moderate IMR is still a hot topic. Adding mitral valve repair (MVr) to coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is questionable. The goal of this study was to assess and compare short-term clinical and echocardiographic results of moderate IMR treated by CABG alone versus another group of patients treated by CABG plus MVr. METHODS: Eighty consecutive patients with ischemic heart disease (IHD) and moderate IMR were divided randomly into two equal groups: group I (40) had only CABG and group II (40) had CABG plus MVr. Patients were evaluated at 1-week, 3-months and 1-year intervals postoperatively. RESULTS: After 1-year follow-up, our study revealed statistically significant improvement in the grade of mitral regurgitation (MR) in group II than group I. The mean value for effective regurgitant orifice area (EROA) was 0.22 ± 0.13 for group I versus 0.03 ± 0.03 for group II (P = 0.001) and for vena contracta (VC), it was 3.8 ± 2.24 for group I versus 0.4 ± 0.49 for group II (P = 0.000). There was also a significant reduction in the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: MVr can be performed safely and concomitantly with CABG in patients having moderate IMR, and its addition to CABG have significant short-term impact on clinical or echocardiographic outcome of patients.

Transthyretin Cardiac Amyloidosis and Aortic Stenosis: Connection and Therapeutic Implications.  ;BACKGROUND: There is a growing interest in the observed significant incidence of transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis in elderly patients with aortic stenosis. Approximately, 16% of patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing aortic valve replacement have transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis. Outcomes after aortic valve replacement appear to be worst in patients with concomitant transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis. METHODS: Publications in PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Embase databases were systematically searched from January 2012 to September 2018 using the keywords transthyretin, amyloidosis, and aortic stenosis. All studies published in English that reported the prevalence, association and outcomes of transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis in patients with aortic stenosis undergoing were included. RESULTS/CONCLUSION: The relationship between aortic stenosis and transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis is not well understood. A few studies have proven successful surgical management when both conditions coexist. This systematic review suggests that transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis is common in elderly patients with aortic stenosis and tend to have high mortality rates after AVR. The significant incidence of the two diseases occurring simultaneously warrants further investigation to improve management strategies in the future.

Acute type A aortic dissection - a review.  ;Acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) is still one of the most challenging diseases that cardiac surgeons encounter. This review is based on the current literature and includes the results from the Nordic Consortium for Acute Type-A Aortic Dissection (NORCAAD) database. It covers different aspects of ATAAD and concentrates on the outcome of surgical repair. The diagnosis is occasionally delayed, and ATAAD is usually lethal if prompt repair is not performed. The dynamic nature of the disease, the variation in presentation and clinical course, and the urgency of treatment require significant attentiveness. Many surgical techniques and perfusion strategies of varying complexity have been described, ranging from simple interposition graft to total arch replacement with frozen elephant trunk and valve-sparing root reconstruction. Although more complex techniques may provide long-term benefit in selected patients, they require significant surgical expertise and experience. Short-term survival is first priority so an expedited operation that fits in with the surgeon's level of expertise is in most cases appropriate.  
An investigation of the effect of freezing storage on the biaxial mechanical properties of excised porcine tricuspid valve anterior leaflets.  ;"The atrioventricular heart valve (AHV) leaflets are critical to the facilitation of proper unidirectional blood flow through the heart. Previously, studies have been conducted to understand the tissue mechanics of healthy AHV leaflets to inform the development of valve-specific computational models and replacement materials for use in diagnosing and treating valvular heart disease. Generally, these studies involved biaxial mechanical testing of the AHV leaflet tissue specimens to extract relevant mechanical properties. Most of those studies considered freezing-based storage systems based on previous findings for other connective tissues such as aortic tissue or skin. However, there remains no study that specifically examines the effects of freezing storage on the characterized mechanical properties of the AHV leaflets. In this study, we aimed to address this gap in knowledge by performing biaxial mechanical characterizations of the tricuspid valve anterior leaflet (TVAL) tissue both before and after a 48-h freezing period. Primary findings of this study include: (i) a statistically insignificant change in the tissue extensibilities, with the frozen tissues being slightly stiffer and more anisotropic than the fresh tissues; and (ii) minimal variations in the stress relaxation behaviors between the fresh and frozen tissues, with the frozen tissues demonstrating slightly lessened relaxation. The findings from this study suggested that freezing-based storage does not significantly impact the observed mechanical properties of one of the five AHV leaflets-the TVAL. The results from this study are useful for reaffirming the experimental methodologies in the previous studies, as well as informing the tissue preservation methods of future investigations of AHV leaflet mechanics.

Aortic valve stenosis awareness in Austria-results of a nationwide survey in 1001 subjects.  ;Despite the prognostic significance of severe aortic valve stenosis, knowledge is limited in the general population. To document the status quo for Austria, knowledge about valvular heart disease/aortic valve stenosis was documented in 1001 participants >60 years of age. 6.7% of respondents were knowledgeable of aortic valve stenosis, with 1.6% being concerned about the condition (24.1% cancer, 18.8% Alzheimer's disease, 15.1% stroke). 29.5% were familiar with valvular heart disease (76.7% heart attack, 36.9% stroke). Only 1/3 reported auscultation by their general practitioner (GP) at least every third visit. Typical symptoms of aortic valve stenosis were likely to be reported by 50%. After exposure to further information on aortic valve stenosis, only 20% reported to be more concerned and ready to obtain more disease-related information. Awareness of surgical and catheter-based treatment options was claimed by 77% of respondents. Awareness campaigns on valvular heart disease are warranted to improve patient care in Austria.  
Life-threatening muscle complications of COL4A1-related disorder.  ;COL4A1-related disorder is recognized as a systemic disease because the alpha 1 chain of type IV collagen, encoded by COL4A1, is essential for basement membrane stability. However, muscular manifestations related to this disorder are rarely reported. We report the case of a 2-year-old boy with porencephaly, who harbored a de novo COL4A1 mutation of c.1853G > A, p. (Gly618Glu) and exhibited recurrent rhabdomyolysis with viral or bacterial infections. Moreover, he developed obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy which required surgical intervention. Skeletal muscle biopsy revealed findings compatible with fiber-type disproportion. Ultrastructural study demonstrated the similar findings previously reported in mice with Col4a1 mutation including collagen disarray and reduction of electron density in the basement membrane of capillary endothelial cells and muscle fibers. Dilated endoplasmic reticulum in the capillary endothelial cells is also noted. This report adds another disease spectrum of COL4A1 mutation which include porencephaly, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, rhabdomyolysis and fiber-type disproportion.

Surgical correction of a pulmonary artery aneurysm with severe pulmonary regurgitation with a valve-sparing technique.  ;Pulmonary artery aneurysms are rare but are associated with a significant risk of rupture and dissection. Moreover, pulmonary valve regurgitation and/or stenosis often coexist. In this study, we present a case of a pulmonary artery aneurysm with severe pulmonary regurgitation in a patient with pulmonary hypertension treated with aneurysm resection and pulmonary valve repair.  
Development of a Ductal Aneurysm in a Patient with Williams Syndrome, and Subsequent Interventional Closure.  ;Whilst stenosis of systemic and pulmonary arteries in Williams syndrome is frequently described, aneurysm formation is uncommon. We provide the first description of a Williams patient with development of an aneurysm of the arterial duct. This aneurysm developed concomitantly with supravalvar aortic, and peripheral pulmonary stenosis. The duct was closed interventionally to reduce the risk of rupture.  
Absent pericardium and lung hypoplasia in a child with severe mitral regurgitation.  ;An 8-year-old girl with severe mitral regurgitation presented with symptoms of heart failure. Clinical investigations did not raise suspicion of an absent left pericardium. Congenital defects of the pericardium are rare and frequently associated with other cardiac lesions. We describe a case of severe mitral regurgitation in a child in whom an absent left-sided pericardium with hypoplasia of left lung was found incidentally during surgery to repair the mitral valve. We believe such associations with other heart diseases is usually circumstantial but can influence the perioperative morbidity, length of hospital stay, and even alter the surgical management.  
Incidence and predictors of vascular complications in transaxillary TAVI.  ;AIMS: Vascular complications are among the most commonly observed complications after TAVI. Iliofemoral vascular outcome has been described extensively. Little is known about vascular complications in transaxillary TAVI. The aim of the current study was to describe the incidence and predictors of axillary artery complications incorporating computed tomography angiography (CTA) measurements. METHODS AND RESULTS: CT analysis was performed in two hundred patients treated with transaxillary TAVI in our centre between January 2014 and December 2017. Vascular complications occurred in 37 (18.5%) patients. Patient characteristics predicting this outcome were female gender (aOR 3.88 [1.48-10.14], p=0.006) and age (aOR 1.08 [1.01-1.16], p=0.034). The CTA measurement predicting vascular complications was a sheath to artery area ratio (SAAR) equal to or larger than 1.63 (OR 3.95 [1.29-12.12], p=0.016). CONCLUSIONS: The present study describes the incidence of axillary artery complications and identifies patient characteristics associated with this outcome. CTA analysis was shown to be an important screening tool in the assessment of patient (access) eligibility. Axillary artery dimensional screening should be based on vascular luminal area assessment rather than diameter measurement alone.  
Outcomes of myocardial fibrosis in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement.  ;"AIMS: We sought to investigate the relevance of myocardial fibrosis, assessed by mid-wall fibrosis risk (MFR) score, with respect to left ventricular (LV) reverse remodelling following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). METHODS AND RESULTS: Between January 2010 and March 2015, we enrolled 207 patients in whom baseline MFR, which includes age, sex, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I, presence of strain pattern on electrocardiography, and peak aortic valve velocity, as well as one-year follow-up echocardiography was available. LV reverse remodelling was defined as a >10% reduction in LV end-diastolic volume index (LVEDVi). A higher MFR score (≥52) was associated with increased LVEDVi and with decreased LV ejection fraction as well as higher baseline NT-proBNP levels (p<0.05 for all). One year after the TAVR procedure, a higher MFR score was associated with a decreased probability of LV reverse remodelling (OR 0.33, 95% CI: 0.23-0.87; p=0.03), which was independent of baseline echocardiographic parameters and comorbidities. In contrast, there was no significant difference in five-year mortality between patients with lower and higher MFR scores (57.9% vs 60.5%, p=0.66). CONCLUSIONS: A higher MFR score is associated with reduced LV reverse remodelling at one-year follow-up, whereas the MFR score does not appear to correlate with long-term mortality after TAVR.  "
Predictive risk factors of early onset left ventricular aneurysm formation in patients with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction.  ;BACKGROUND: Left ventricular aneurysm (LVA) is a severe complication of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and is associated with poor prognosis due to high mortality. However, predictors of LVA formation in early period are inadequately defined. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study is to determine potential predictors of LVA formation in early period (<15 days after admission) after acute STEMI. METHODS: The present study was retrospectively conducted involving 1823 STEMI patients based on the AMI database of our clinic between January 2013 and April 2019. Among STEMI patients with regional wall motion abnormality (RWMA), the baseline, angiographic, procedural characteristics of patients with early-onset LVA and controls without LVA were compared. The controls were matched 2:1 with LVA cases for the admission date. Patients with prior myocardial infarction, non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, severe heart valve disease, and patients without coronary angiography were excluded. The odds ratio (OR) and confidence interval (CI) were obtained by logistic regression analysis and all statistical analysis were performed by SPSS 25.0. RESULTS: Among 1823 STEMI patients who underwent coronary angiography, 103 eligible patients (median age 67 years) had LVA and were compared to 206 patients without LVA (median age 60 years). In multivariate analysis, RWMA in the left ventricular anterior wall (OR 13.17, 95%CI 2.21-78.57, p=0.005) was found to be the most striking predictor of LVA, followed by RWMA in the apex (OR 7.93, 95%CI 2.22-28.30, p=0.001). Female sex (OR 3.91, 95%CI 1.54-9.93, p=0.004), peak N-terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide (NT-pro BNP,OR 1.08, 95%CI 1.01-1.16, p=0.031), time between onset of pain and balloon time (OR 1.01, 95%CI 1.00-1.01, P=0.016), and presence of QS-waves on initial electrocardiogram (OR 3.06, 95%CI 1.49-6.27, P=0.016) were independently associated with LVA formation. CONCLUSION: This study indicated that female sex, peak NT-pro BNP, the time between the onset of pain and balloon time, presence of QS-waves on initial electrocardiogram, RWMA of left ventricular anterior wall and apex were the independent predictors of early-onset LVA in patients with acute STEMI.  
High prevalence of ascending aortic dilatation in a consecutive coronary CT angiography patient population.  ;"OBJECTIVES: To clarify the prevalence and risk factors of ascending aortic (AA) dilatation according to ESC 2014 guidelines. METHODS: This study included 1000 consecutive patients scheduled for diagnostic coronary artery computed tomographic angiography. AA diameter was retrospectively measured in 3 planes: sinus valsalva, sinotubular junction, and tubular part. The threshold for AA dilatation was set to > 40 mm which has been suggested as an upper normal limit for AA diameter in ESC 2014 guidelines on aortic diseases. Aortic size index (ASI) using the ratio between aortic diameter and body surface area (BSA) was applied as a comparative measurement. The threshold for AA dilatation was set to the upper limit of normal distribution exceeding two standard deviations (95%). Risk factors for AA dilatation were collected from medical records. RESULTS: The patients' mean age was 52.9 ± 9.8 years (66.5% women). The prevalence of AA dilatation was 23.0% in the overall study population (52.5% males) and 15.1% in the subgroup of patients with no coronary artery disease or bicuspid (BAV)/mechanical aortic valve (n = 365). According to the normal-distributed ASI values, the threshold for sinus valsalva was defined as 23.2 mm/m2 and for tubular part 22.2 mm/m2 in the subgroup. Higher BSA was associated with larger AA dimensions (r = 0.407, p < 0.001). Male gender (p < 0.001), BAV (p < 0.001), hypertension (p = 0.009) in males, and smoking (p < 0.001) appeared as risk factors for AA dilatation. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of AA dilatation is high with current ESC guidelines for normal AA dimension, especially in males. Body size is strongly associated with AA dimensions; it would be more reliable to use BSA-adjusted AA diameters for the definition of AA dilatation. KEY POINTS: • The prevalence of AA dilatation is high in patients who are candidates for coronary CT angiography. • Body size is strongly associated with AA dimensions.  "
Mid-term results of valve repairs for atrial functional mitral and tricuspid regurgitations.  ;"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine the mid-term outcomes of surgical valve repairs for atrial functional mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation in patients with atrial fibrillation. METHODS: From October 2008 to August 2016, we performed mitral and tricuspid valve repairs in 45 patients with permanent atrial fibrillation, chronic heart failure, preserved left ventricular ejection fraction, and at least moderate functional mitral regurgitation and mild functional tricuspid regurgitation. The follow-up period ranged from 56 to 3283 days (2-109 months; median 932 days). RESULTS: All patients underwent both mitral and tricuspid annuloplasty. Mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation improved from 2.6 ± 0.6 (0-3) and 2.0 ± 0.7 (0-3) preoperatively to 0.4 ± 0.3 (0-3) and 0.8 ± 0.5 (0-3) at the most recent echocardiography (p < 0.0001 and p < 0.0001), respectively. Further, the New York Heart Association functional class dramatically improved from 2.8 ± 0.7 to 1.5 ± 0.7 (p < 0.0001). Postoperative cardiovascular events occurred in 10 patients, including 3 with re-admissions for heart failure. The event-free rates were 93%, 87%, and 52% at 1, 3, and 5 years after surgery, respectively. The preoperative left atrial volume index was the independent predictor of postoperative cardiovascular events. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that mitral and tricuspid valve repairs lead to reductions in regurgitations and heart failure symptoms in patients with atrial functional mitral and tricuspid regurgitations. The preoperative left atrial size should be recognized as an important risk factor of postoperative cardiovascular events.  "
Expanding the indications for transcatheter aortic valve implantation.  ;Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has revolutionized the treatment of symptomatic severe aortic valve stenosis. Current guidelines recommend TAVI in patients at increased operative risk of death. Advanced imaging planning, new transcatheter valve platforms, procedure streamlining and growing operator experience have improved procedural safety and bioprosthetic valve performance. As a result, TAVI has been explored for other indications. Two randomized trials published in 2019 to assess TAVI in patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis at low operative risk have set the stage for a new wave of indications. In younger and low-risk patients, TAVI had an early safety benefit over surgical aortic valve replacement and was associated with faster discharge from hospital and recovery and fewer rehospitalizations. In patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis, TAVI has now been explored across the entire spectrum of operative risk, from inoperable to low-risk populations, in properly designed, randomized clinical trials, although data on the long-term durability of these valves are lacking. The use of TAVI in severe bicuspid aortic valve stenosis, asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis, moderate aortic stenosis in combination with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, and isolated pure aortic regurgitation is now under investigation in clinical trials. In this Review, we provide our perspective on these evolving indications for TAVI, discuss relevant available data from clinical trials, and highlight procedural implications and caveats of new and future indications.

Pregnancy Outcomes in Women After the Arterial Switch Operation.  ;BACKGROUND: Pregnancy outcomes after the arterial switch operation (ASO) are rare. We sought to determine outcomes of ASO survivors who underwent pregnancy. METHODS: Female patients who had an ASO and underwent pregnancy were identified from the congenital heart disease pregnancy clinic at The Royal Melbourne Hospital. All follow-up data were collected retrospectively by medical record review. RESULTS: Eleven (11) women were identified as having undergone medical care during pregnancy, from the adult congenital database, at The Royal Melbourne Hospital. There were 17 successful pregnancies, and nine women have been followed post pregnancy. Of the 17 successful deliveries, eight were delivered by Caesarean section, seven were vaginal deliveries and two were instrumented vaginal deliveries. Of the eight Caesarean sections, five were emergency and three were elective. The indications for emergency Caesarean section were obstructed labour (n = 2), abnormal cardiotocography (n = 1), obstructed labour and abnormal cardiotocography (n = 1) and congestive cardiac failure (n = 1). There was one neonatal complication (respiratory distress requiring intubation) in a child born at 31 weeks. There were maternal obstetric complications in 10 patients. There were two maternal cardiac complications during pregnancy (heart failure and rapid atrial fibrillation/flutter). There was no change in left ventricular function post-pregnancy. There was progression of severity of neo-aortic valve regurgitation in two patients post pregnancy (trivial to mild and moderate-severe to severe respectively). CONCLUSION: Pregnancy post ASO appears to be safe in the majority of women.

Clinical Practice Update on Infectious Endocarditis.  ;"Infectious endocarditis is a highly morbid disease with approximately 43,000 cases per year in the United States. The modified Duke Criteria have poor sensitivity; however, advances in diagnostic imaging provide new tools for clinicians to make what can be an elusive diagnosis. There are a number of risk stratification calculators that can help guide providers in medical and surgical management. Patients who inject drugs pose unique challenges for the health care system as their addiction, which is often untreated, can lead to recurrent infections after valve replacement. There is a need to increase access to medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorders in this population. Recent studies suggest that oral and depo antibiotics may be viable alternatives to conventional intravenous therapy. Additionally, shorter courses of antibiotic therapy are potentially equally efficacious in patients who are surgically managed. Given the complexities involved with their care, patients with endocarditis are best managed by multidisciplinary teams.  "

From embryogenesis to adulthood: Critical role for GATA factors in heart development and function.  ;Cardiac development is governed by a complex network of transcription factors (TFs) that regulate cell fates in a spatiotemporal manner. Among these, the GATA family of zinc finger TFs plays prominent roles in regulating the development of the myocardium, endocardium, and outflow tract. This family comprises six members three of which, GATA4, 5, and 6, are predominantly expressed in cardiac cells where they activate specific downstream gene targets via interactions with one another and with other TFs and signaling molecules. Their critical function in heart formation is evidenced by the phenotypes of animal models lacking these factors and by the broad spectrum of human congenital heart diseases associated with mutations in their genes. Similarly, in the postnatal heart, these proteins play significant and nonredundant roles in cardiac function, regulating adaptive stress responses including cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and survival, as well as endothelial homeostasis and angiogenesis. As such, decreased expression of either GATA4, 5, or 6 results in impaired cardiovascular homeostasis and increased risk of premature and serious cardiovascular events such as hypertension, arrhythmia, aortopathy, and heart failure. Although a great deal of progress has been made in understanding GATA-dependent regulatory processes in the heart, the molecular mechanisms underlying the specificity of GATA factors and their upstream regulation remain incompletely understood. The knowledge and tools developed since their discovery 25 years ago should accelerate progress toward further elucidation of their mechanisms of action in health and disease. This in turn will greatly improve diagnosis and care for the millions of individuals affected by congenital and acquired cardiac disease worldwide.

Differences in clinical valve size selection and valve size selection for patient-specific computer simulation in transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR): a retrospective multicenter analysis.  ;"Valve size selection for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is currently based on cardiac CT-scan. At variance with patient-specific computer simulation, this does not allow the assessment of the valve-host interaction. We aimed to compare clinical valve size selection and valve size selection by an independent expert for computer simulation. A multicenter retrospective analysis of valve size selection by the physician and the independent expert in 141 patients who underwent TAVR with the self-expanding CoreValve or Evolut R. Baseline CT-scan was used for clinical valve size selection and for patient-specific computer simulation. Simulation results were not available for clinical use. Overall true concordance between clinical and simulated valve size selection was observed in 47 patients (33%), true discordance in 15 (11%) and ambiguity in 79 (56%). In 62 (44%, cohort A) one valve size was simulated whereas two valve sizes were simulated in 79 (56%, cohort B). In cohort A, concordance was 76% and discordance was 24%; a smaller valve size was selected for simulation in 10 patients and a larger in 5. In cohort B, a different valve size was selected for simulation in all patients in addition to the valve size that was used for TAVR. The different valve size concerned a smaller valve in 45 patients (57%) and a larger in 34 (43%). Selection of the valve size differs between the physician and the independent computer simulation expert who used the same source of information. These findings indicate that valve sizing in TAVR is still more intricate than generally assumed.  "

Utility of computed tomography in cases of aortic valve stenosis before and after transcatheter aortic valve implantation.  ;"Trans-catheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has been recognized as a useful treatment for patients with severe aortic valve stenosis, particularly those with moderate to high risks of open heart surgery. A thorough evaluation of the aortic valve complex, including the size or presence of calcifications of the leaflets and annulus, is important for the selection of appropriate candidates, artificial valve types and approach. Echocardiography is useful for the precise evaluation of aortic valve stenosis severity and aortic valve complex morphology, but it is not useful to evaluate three-dimensional aortic valve anatomy and pathway for the catheter of aortic valve implantation. Electrocardiography (ECG)-gating computed tomography (CT) has recently been recognized as a useful modality for evaluating significant coronary artery stenosis because of its higher spatial and temporal resolution and diagnostic accuracy based on recent studies. ECG-gating CT is also useful for evaluating aortic valve complex morphology, including calcifications and whole aorta and iliac arteries, as the access route of catheter in TAVI. TAVI candidates, who are at high risk of open surgery, tend to be old and require anti-platelet after TAVI; therefore CT, is also useful for screening for non-cardiac diseases including malignant tumors just before TAVI. Therefore, here we introduce the utility of cardiac and whole body CT in cases of severe aortic valve stenosis before and after TAVI.  "
Uncertainties and challenges in surgical and transcatheter tricuspid valve therapy: a state-of-the-art expert review.  ;Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is a frequent and complex problem, commonly combined with left-sided heart disease, such as mitral regurgitation. Significant TR is associated with increased mortality if left untreated or recurrent after therapy. Tricuspid regurgitation was historically often disregarded and remained undertreated. Surgery is currently the only Class I Guideline recommended therapy for TR, in the form of annuloplasty, leaflet repair, or valve replacement. As growing experience of transcatheter therapy in structural heart disease, many dedicated transcatheter tricuspid repair or replacement devices, which mimic well-established surgical techniques, are currently under development. Nevertheless, many aspects of TR are little understood, including the disease process, surgical or interventional risk stratification, and predictors of successful therapy. The optimal treatment timing and the choice of proper surgical or interventional technique for significant TR remain to be elucidated. In this context, we aim to highlight the current evidence, underline major controversial issues in this field and present a future roadmap for TR therapy.

Significance of echocardiographic evaluation for transcatheter aortic valve implantation.  ;Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is widely accepted as an alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) for the treatment of severe aortic stenosis (AS). Existing scientific evidence demonstrates that TAVI is superior to SAVR, and it is expected that indications for the clinical applications of TAVI will be expanded in the future. Echocardiography plays a key role in perioperative assessment of patients undergoing TAVI. Preprocedural echocardiographic evaluation is important to determine the severity of AS in addition to patients' anatomical suitability for TAVI. Furthermore, echocardiography is essential for intraoperative guidance, assessment of complications, postoperative evaluation, and prognostic prediction. Inaccurate echocardiographic measurements and evaluation can lead to less-than-optimal/inappropriate treatment strategies in patients with AS. Therefore, a thorough understanding of the limitations of echocardiographic evaluation is important. This review summarizes the role of echocardiographic evaluation in patients undergoing TAVI.  
Postoperative Atrial Fibrillation Following Cardiac Surgery: From Pathogenesis to Potential Therapies.  ;"Postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) is a major complication after cardiac surgery which can lead to high rates of morbidity and mortality, an enhanced length of hospital stay, and an increased cost of care. POAF is postulated to be a multifactorial phenomenon; however, some major pathogeneses have been proposed, including inflammatory pathways, oxidative stress, and autonomic dysfunction. Genetic studies also showed that inflammatory pathways, beta-1 adrenoreceptor variants, G protein-coupled receptor kinase 5 gene variants, and non-coding single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the 4q25 chromosomal locus are involved in this phenomenon. Moreover, several predisposing factors lead to the development of POAF, consisting of pre-, intra-, and postoperative contributors. The main predisposing factors comprise age, prior history of major cardiovascular risk factors, and ischemia-reperfusion injury during surgery. The management of POAF is based on the usual therapies used for non-surgical AF, including medications for either rate control or rhythm control in hemodynamically unstable patients. The perioperative administration of β-blockers and some antiarrhythmic agents has been recommended in major international guidelines. In addition, upstream therapies consisting of colchicine, magnesium, statins, and antioxidants have attenuated the incidence of POAF; however, some uncomfortable side effects developed in large randomized trials. The use of anticoagulation has also resulted in less mortality in patients with POAF at higher risk of thromboembolic events. Despite these recommendations, the actual regimen for the prevention of POAF remains controversial. In this review, we highlight the pathogenesis, predisposing factors, and potential therapeutic options for the management of patients at risk for or with POAF following cardiac surgery.  "

Predictors of haemodynamic structural valve deterioration following transcatheter aortic valve implantation with latest-generation balloon-expandable valves.  ;"AIMS: Elevated gradients have been proposed to be associated with haemodynamic structural valve deterioration (SVD) after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI); however, data regarding their characterisation remain scarce. This study sought to investigate the prevalence and predictors of moderate or greater SVD and the prevalence of valve thrombosis during follow-up after TAVI with balloon-expandable valves. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 691 patients undergoing transfemoral TAVI were enrolled. The primary endpoint was moderate or severe haemodynamic SVD during 12-month follow-up after TAVI, defined as (I) mean transvalvular gradient ≥20 mmHg or (II) mean transvalvular gradient increase ≥10 mmHg. The primary endpoint was observed in 10.3% after TAVI. Use of a 20 mm valve, valve-in-valve procedure and oral anticoagulation (OAC) were independently associated with haemodynamic SVD, whereas valve-in-valve procedure and OAC were the only significant variables after accounting for death as a competing event. OAC was significantly associated with haemodynamic SVD (RR 8.65; p=0.004) and death (RR 3.57; p=0.06), whereas valve-in-valve procedure was only associated with haemodynamic SVD (RR 52.76; p<0.001). Valve thrombosis was present in 0.87% (6/691) of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of moderate or greater haemodynamic SVD during the first 12 months after TAVI is 10.3%. Procedural factors and pharmacotherapy seem to play a key role during manifestation. Future studies should focus on the underlying mechanisms.  "
Stress-induced remodelling of the mitral valve: a model for leaflet thickening and superimposed tissue formation in mitral valve disease.  ;"AIMS: In mitral valve prolapse (MVP), leaflet thickening has recently been suggested to be due, in addition to a myxomatous degeneration, to the presence of a superimposed tissue (SIT), defined as an additional fibrous layer on top of the original leaflet. The mechanisms of SIT formation are currently unknown. We hypothesized that SIT formation would result from excessive leaflet stress and we used a unique ex vivo model to assess the correlation between leaflet remodelling and the type and location of mechanical stress and to elucidate the mechanisms underlying SIT formation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Human diseased mitral valves (MVs; n = 21) were histologically analysed for SIT formation and original leaflet thickening. The SIT comprised of various compositions of extracellular matrix and could reach more than 50% of total leaflet thickness. Original leaflet and SIT thickness did not show significant correlation (r = -0.27, P = 0.23), suggesting different regulatory mechanisms. To study the role of the mechanical environment on MV remodelling, mouse MV were cultured in their natural position in the heart and subjected to various haemodynamic conditions representing specific phases of the cardiac cycle and the MVP configuration. SIT formation was induced in the ex vivo model, mostly present on the atrial side, and clearly dependent on the duration, type, and extent of mechanical stress. Specific stainings and lineage tracing experiments showed that SIT comprises of macrophages and myofibroblasts and is associated with the activation of the transforming growth factor-beta and bone morphogenetic protein signalling pathways. Migration of valvular interstitial cells and macrophages through breakages of the endothelial cell lining contributed to SIT formation. CONCLUSIONS: Mechanical stresses induce specific cellular and molecular changes in the MV that result in SIT formation. These observations provide the first insights in the mechanism of SIT formation and represent an initial step to identify potential novel and early treatment for MVP.  "
Comparison of Mitral Valve Repair versus Replacement for the Progression of Functional Tricuspid Regurgitation.  ;"BACKGROUND: Function tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is frequently observed in patients undergoing mitral valve surgery. It is unclear that mitral valve repair (MVr) or mitral valve replacement (MVR) has influence on the likelihood of late TR progression. METHODS: This study included 193 patients with degenerative mitral valve disease who underwent either MVr or MVR. Detailed preoperative materials, follow-up information, and echocardiographic data were collected and statistically analyzed. RESULTS: At 6 and 12 months postoperatively, MVR patients were more likely to have New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV symptoms than MVr patients (6 mo: 15.2% vs 5.0%, 12 mo: 13.0% vs 4.0%, both P <0.05). At 24 months, the incidence of Grade 1+ TR was significantly higher in MVR patients than MVr patients (25.0% vs 12.9%, P <0.05). In univariate analysis, age (odds ratio [OR] = 1.036, P = 0.036), MVR (OR = 2.256, P = 0.033), and preoperative TR area (TRA; OR = 1.541, P = 0.047) were significant predictors for TR progression. In multivariate logistics analysis, only MVR was independently risk factor (P = 0.006). Subsequently, patients were divided into tricuspid valve repair (TVr) group and untreated group. In both subgroups, MVR patients were associated with significantly larger TRA (P <0.01). CONCLUSION: MVR was an independent risk factor for TR progression, whether tricuspid valve was treated or not.  "
Risk Analysis and Outcomes of Postoperative Renal Failure After Aortic Valve Surgery in the United States.  ;"BACKGROUND: Postoperative renal failure (RF) compromises early outcomes in cardiac surgery. In contrast, long-term survival and progression of RF after aortic valve replacement (AVR) with or without coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) remain undefined. METHODS: From 2008 through 2015, records of AVR with or without CABG in The Society of Thoracic Surgeons database were linked to Medicare claims data. Postoperative RF was categorized as being with new dialysis (RF-D) or without new dialysis (RF no-D). Cox proportional hazards models were used to conduct a risk analysis and evaluate outcomes in this patient group. RESULTS: Of 164,727 patients undergoing AVR with or without CABG, 3.5% had postoperative RF, of whom 63.3% required dialysis. Operative mortality of postoperative RF was 39.2%, higher for dialysis than for no-dialysis patients (46.1% vs 26.1%, P < .0001). Both RF dialysis patients and no-dialysis patients had a higher early (less than 30-day) mortality risk (hazard ratio [HR] 11.29, P < .0001 and HR 8.03, P < .0001, respectively) compared with no postoperative RF. At a median follow-up of 2.7 years, RF-D and RF no-D remained relevant risk factors, however, with a lower magnitude of effect (HR 2.42, P < .0001, and HR 1.69, P < .0001, respectively). Preoperative glomerular filtration rate (GFR) less than 30 mL · min-1 · 1.73 m-2 had a lower early mortality risk (HR 0.48, P < .0001) but higher late mortality risk (HR 1.5, P < .0001) compared with GFR greater than 60. Predictors for long-term progression to RF-D included preoperative GFR less than 30 (HR 13, P < .0001), GFR 30 to 60 (HR 2.47, P = .006), and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (HR 1.96, P = .001). CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative RF after AVR with or without CABG was associated with higher early and late mortality, which further increased with a new requirement for dialysis. Once postoperative RF develops, preoperative renal dysfunction does not increase early mortality; however, it predicts late survival. Preoperative renal function is associated with progression of postoperative RF to dialysis.  "

Left Ventricular Mass in Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Assessed by 2D-Echocardiography: Validation with Magnetic Resonance Imaging.  ;"We aim to validate echocardiographic left ventricular (LV) mass (echoLVM) in sixty-one patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), using cardiac magnetic resonance measures (cmrLVM) as gold standard. cmrLVM was calculated using LV short-axis images, from base to apex, whereas echoLVM by LV epicardial minus LV endocardial volumes in 4 and 2 chamber views, using Simpson disk summation; trabeculae and papillary muscle were excluded in both cmrLVM and echoLVM. cmrLVM and echoLVM were not different by paired t test (145 ± 66 vs 147 ± 61; p = 0.240), and their correlation was good (r = 0.977; p < 0.0001). Intraclass correlation demonstrated reliability of echoLVM with cmrLVM (ρ = 0.987; Cls = 0.978-0.992; p < 0.0001). LV end-diastolic volume was higher by CMR than that by echo (137 ± 33 vs 85 ± 28 mL, p < 0.0001), resulting in a lower mass/volume ratio (1.1 ± 0.4 vs 1.8 ± 0.8, p < 0.0001). EchoLVM may be determined in patients with HCM. However, mass/volume ratio is higher by echocardiography than that by CMR.  "

From contamination to infective endocarditis-a population-based retrospective study of Corynebacterium isolated from blood cultures.  ;Corynebacterium is a genus that can contaminate blood cultures and also cause severe infections like infective endocarditis (IE). Our purpose was to investigate microbiological and clinical features associated with contamination and true infection. A retrospective population-based study of Corynebacterium bacteremia 2012-2017 in southern Sweden was performed. Corynebacterium isolates were species determined using a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Patient were, from the medical records, classified as having true infection or contamination caused by Corynebacterium through a scheme considering both bacteriological and clinical features and the groups were compared. Three hundred thirty-nine episodes of bacteremia with Corynebacterium were identified in 335 patients of which 30 (8.8%) episodes were classified as true infection. Thirteen patients with true bacteremia had only one positive blood culture. Infections were typically community acquired and affected mostly older males with comorbidities. The focus of infection was most often unknown, and in-hospital mortality was around 10% in both the groups with true infection and contamination. Corynebacterium jeikeium and Corynebacterium striatum were significantly overrepresented in the group with true infection, whereas Corynebacterium afermentans was significantly more common in the contamination group. Eight episodes of IE were identified, all of which in patients with heart valve prosthesis. Six of the IE cases affected the aortic valve and six of seven patients were male. The species of Corynebacterium in blood cultures can help to determine if a finding represent true infection or contamination. The finding of a single blood culture with Corynebacterium does not exclude true infection such as IE.  
Mid-term outcome in patients with bicuspid aortic valve stenosis following transcatheter aortic valve replacement with a current generation device: A multicenter study.  ;"OBJECTIVES: To perform clinical and echocardiographic follow-up beyond 1 year in consecutive patients with severe bicuspid aortic stenosis (AS) undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) with a current generation balloon-expandable valve. BACKGROUND: Treatment of bicuspid aortic valve disease with TAVR remains controversial and late follow-up data is still scarce. METHODS: We collected baseline characteristics, procedural data, 30-day and mid-term clinical follow-up findings from six centers in Europe and Canada from patients with bicuspid AS treated with TAVR using the SAPIEN 3 valve. RESULTS: Seventy-nine patients underwent TAVR. Mean age was 76 ± 9 years; median STS risk score for mortality was 3.8% (interquartile range 2.3-5.5%). Median follow-up was 390 days (interquartile range 138-739 days). Device success was achieved in 95% of patients. Postimplantation mean aortic gradient decreased from 50.2 ± 16.2 to 8.8 ± 4.4 mmHg and no patient had more than mild aortic regurgitation. At last follow-up, there was persistent good valve performance. At 30 days and 1 year, the rates of all-cause mortality were 3.8 and 7.7%, stroke 1.2 and 1.2%, and the rate of new pacemakers 18 and 18%. CONCLUSIONS: Our data confirm that treating patients with stenotic bicuspid aortic valves is safe, effective, and has favorable valve performance over time.  "
Preoperative transcranial Doppler and cerebral oximetry as predictors of delirium following valvular heart surgery: a case-control study.  ;Delirium is a frequent and serious complication after cardiac surgery with cerebral hypoperfusion as one from the key pathophysiological mechanisms. Middle cerebral artery (MCA) mean blood flow velocity (MFV) measured by transcranial Doppler has been used as a marker of cerebral perfusion, and cerebral oximetry (rSO2) value as a marker of its adequacy. This prospective observational trial examined the predictive value of MCA MFV and rSO2, measured immediately before induction of anesthesia, for delirium after valvular heart surgery in elderly patients. In 113 patients, delirium was evaluated for 7 days postoperatively, using the confusion assessment method for the intensive care unit. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of postoperative delirium. Overall, 16 patients (14%) exhibited delirium. MCA MVF values could not predict the development of delirium. Preoperative statin use, geriatric depression scale score, and low preoperative rSO2 (< 60%) showed association with delirium occurrence in univariable analysis. After multivariable analysis, only the low preoperative rSO2 (< 60%) (OR 6.748, 95% CI 1.647-27.652, P = 0.008) remained as an independent predictor of delirium. Preoperative MCA MFV was not significantly associated with delirium after valvular heart surgery in elderly patients, while a low baseline rSO2 value was associated with a sevenfold increased risk of delirium.  
Ascending Aortic Aneurysm After Repair of Aortico-Left Ventricular Tunnel.  ;Ascending aortic aneurysm following aortico-left ventricular tunnel (ALVT) repair is an uncommon but life-threatening complication. A 27-year-old man had received patch closure for ALVT at infancy. Eighteen years later, aortic valve replacement for severe aortic regurgitation and direct suture for recurrent slit tunnel were performed. Another 9 years later, ascending aortic replacement was performed because of ascending aortic aneurysm. Thus we report an uncommon case of ascending aortic aneurysm 27 years after the repair of an ALVT.  
Additive prognostic significance of ejection fraction for ESC risk model in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients.  ;"The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) clinical risk model is reported in predicting sudden death of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). We examined the validity of this model and investigated the significance of ejection fraction (EF) in predicting the prognosis using ESC risk model in HCM patients. 305 HCM patients (198 males) were followed (median follow-up 4.8 years) for life-threatening arrhythmic events (sudden death, aborted sudden death, sustained VT/VF, appropriate ICD intervention for VT/VF) and were divided using ESC risk model into low- (Group L), intermediate- (Group I) and high- (Group H) risk groups. There was a significant difference in the events rate among the 3 groups (L, 0.9%/year; I, 3.9%/year; H, 6.8%/year; log-rank p < 0.001) in all study patients. Reduced EF (<50%) was identified in 27 (8.9%) cases. There was a significant difference in the events rate among the 3 groups in patients with reduced EF (L, 2.4%/year; I, 4.9%/year; H, 16.1%/year; log-rank p = 0.025). There was a significant difference in the events rate among 2 groups in patients stratified as Group H (preserved EF, 3.1%/year vs. reduced EF, 16.1%/year; log-rank p = 0.041). ESC risk model precisely predicts life-threatening events in patients with HCM. Adding EF to ESC risk model are useful for further risk stratification of life-threatening arrhythmic events.  "
Impact of gender on heart failure presentation in non-obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  ;"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a genetic cardiac disease that represents a broad spectrum of morphologic features and clinical presentations. However, little is known about the impact of gender differences in heart failure (HF) development in non-obstructive HCM. We assessed clinical and echocardiographic parameters according to gender in patients with non-obstructive HCM and evaluated the impact of gender on HF presentation and cardiovascular (CV) outcomes in this population. We investigated 202 consecutive patients with non-obstructive HCM. Clinical parameters and conventional echocardiographic measurements including tissue Doppler measurements were evaluated and compared according to gender. Additionally, left ventricular (LV) deformation was assessed with global longitudinal strain (GLS) utilizing 2D speckle tracking software. Of the 202 patients (age = 63 ± 14 years, male: female = 141: 61), 51 patients (24.8%) presented with HF and female patients had HF more frequently (52.5% vs. 12.8%, P < 0.001). Females were older, had a higher prevalence of atrial fibrillation, had increased left atrial volume (LAV), and a higher ratio of early diastolic mitral inflow to early annular velocity (E/e') than males (70 ± 12 years vs. 59 ± 14 years, P < 0.001 for age; 51.4 ± 19.3 mL/m2 vs. 40.0 [Formula: see text] 13.4 mL/m2, P < 0.001 for indexed LAV; 17.2 [Formula: see text] 6.0 vs. 13.0 [Formula: see text] 4.3, P < 0.001 for E/e'). While LV maximal thickness and LV ejection fraction were comparable between men and women, GLS was decreased significantly in female patients (- 13.5 [Formula: see text] 3.4% vs. - 15.6 [Formula: see text] 4.0%, P = 0.001 for GLS). Even after adjusting for clinical factors, female was independently associated with HF presentation (Odd ratio 5.19, 95% CI 2.24-12.03, P < 0.001). During a median follow-up duration 34.0 months, 20 patients (9.9%) had HF hospitalization or CV death. In a multivariable analysis, female gender was associated with higher risk of the composite of HF hospitalization or CV death and HF hospitalization alone than male (Adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 3.31, 95% CI 1.17-9.35, P = 0.024 for primary composite outcome of HF hospitalization or CV death; adjusted HR = 4.78, 95% CI 1.53-14.96, P = 0.007 for HF hospitalization). In patients with non-obstructive HCM, female patients presented with HF more frequently and showed a higher risk of CV events than male patients. LA volume, E/e' and LV mechanics were different between the genders, suggesting that these might contribute to greater susceptibility to HF in women with HCM.  "
Cardiac Surgery in Patients With Opioid Use Disorder: An Analysis of 1.7 Million Surgeries.  ;"BACKGROUND: Adverse repercussions associated with the current opioid epidemic have been documented in many surgical specialties. This study evaluated the impact of opioid use disorder (OUD) on in-hospital cardiac surgery outcomes by using a large national database. METHODS: Using the National Inpatient Sample, this study isolated patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting, valve repair, or valve replacement from 2009 to 2014. Patients were stratified by OUD status. Multivariable analysis was performed to evaluate the association between opioid use and postoperative outcomes. Patients were further stratified by surgery type. RESULTS: Overall, 1,743,161 patients underwent cardiac surgery, and 6960 patients had OUD (0.4%). Mean age was 47.2 and 65.8 years among those with and without OUD, respectively. Although in-hospital mortality did not differ among these groups, patients with OUD had a significantly higher incidence of stroke (8.3% vs 2.8%) and acute kidney injury (21.4% vs 16.2%), longer hospital stays (18 days vs 10 days), and higher hospitalization costs ($81,238 vs $58,654; all P < .01). However, after adjusting for patient and hospital-level factors, OUD was associated only with a longer hospital length of stay (2.2 days; 95% confidence interval, 1.19 to 3.20) compared with non-opioid users. CONCLUSIONS: OUD among cardiac surgery patients is associated with prolonged hospitalization and increased risk of postoperative morbidity, mainly driven by the patient's preoperative risk factors. Strategies to minimize these risk factors at the prehospitalization level is warranted to curb the opioid epidemic and improve overall outcomes in this vulnerable population.  "

Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing Following Open Repair for a Proximal Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm or Dissection.  ;"PURPOSE: There are limited data on cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPX) and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), following open repair for a proximal thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection. The aim was to evaluate serious adverse events, abnormal CPX event rate, CRF (peak oxygen uptake, (Equation is included in full-text article.)O2peak), and blood pressure. METHODS: Patients were retrospectively identified from cardiac rehabilitation participation or prospectively enrolled in a research study and grouped by phenotype: (1) bicuspid aortic valve/thoracic aortic aneurysm, (2) tricuspid aortic valve/thoracic aortic aneurysm, and (3) acute type A aortic dissection. RESULTS: Patients (n = 128) completed a CPX a median of 2.9 mo (interquartile range: 1.8, 3.5) following repair. No serious adverse events were reported, although 3 abnormal exercise tests (2% event rate) were observed. Eighty-one percent of CPX studies were considered peak effort (defined as respiratory exchange ratio of ≥1.05). Median measured (Equation is included in full-text article.)O2peak was <36% predicted normative values (19.2 mL·kgmin vs 29.3 mLkgmin, P < .0001); the most marked impairment in (Equation is included in full-text article.)O2peak was observed in the acute type A aortic dissection group (<40% normative values), which was significantly different from other groups (P < .05). Peak exercise systolic and diastolic blood pressures were 160 mm Hg (144, 172) and 70 mm Hg (62, 80), with no differences noted between groups. CONCLUSIONS: We observed no serious adverse events with an abnormal CPX event rate of only 2% 3 mo following repair for a proximal thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection. (Equation is included in full-text article.)O2peak was reduced among all patient groups, especially the acute type A aortic dissection group, which may be clinically significant, given the well-established prognostic importance of reduced cardiorespiratory fitness.

Altered 4-D magnetic resonance imaging flow characteristics in complex congenital aortic arch repair.  ;BACKGROUND: Interrupted aortic arch (IAA) is a rare but severe congenital abnormality often associated with bicuspid aortic valve (BAV). Complex re-interventions are often needed despite surgical advances, but the impact of aortic hemodynamics in repaired patients is unknown. OBJECTIVE: Investigate effect of IAA repairs on aortic hemodynamics, wall shear stress and flow derangements via 4-D flow MRI. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed age- and gender-matched cohorts (IAA [n=6], BAV alone [n=6], controls [n=6]) undergoing cardiac MRI including 4-D flow. Aortic dimensions were measured from standard MR angiography. We quantified peak systolic velocities, regurgitant fractions and wall shear stress in the ascending aorta (AAo), transverse arch and descending aorta (DAo) from 4-D flow, and we graded helix/vortex flow patterns from 3-D blood flow visualization. RESULTS: Children and young adults with IAA had a wide range of arch dimensions, peak systolic velocities, regurgitant fractions and flow grades. Peak transverse arch systolic velocities were higher in patients with IAA versus controls (P=0.02). Flow derangements in the AAo were found in patients with IAA (median grade=2, 5/6 patients, P=0.04) and BAV (median grade=3, 5/6 patients, P=0.03) versus controls. Flow derangements in the DAo were only seen in patients with IAA (median grade=1, 5/6 patients, P=0.04), and 5/6 people with IAA had helical flow in head and neck vessels. Wall shear stress was increased in people with IAA along the superior transverse arch and proximal DAo versus controls (P=0.02). CONCLUSION: Complex congenital aortic arch repairs can change aortic hemodynamics. Associated cardiac defects can further alter findings. Studies are warranted to investigate clinical implications in larger cohorts.

Degenerative Mitral Valve Repair Restores Life Expectancy.  ;BACKGROUND: Mitral valve repair (MVr) for severe, degenerative mitral regurgitation is the gold standard, because medical management carries poor prognosis. However, despite clear benefit of MVr, many eligible patients are untreated. This study investigated whether MVr restores patients to normal life expectancy, at any age of operation, by comparing long-term survival of patients after MVr with the life expectancy of the general United States population. METHODS: This retrospective study investigated 1011 patients with degenerative mitral regurgitation who underwent isolated MVr between 2003 and 2017. Parametric distribution analysis was applied to long-term post-MVr mortality data, and Weibull probability plots provided the best-fit distribution by Anderson-Darling Goodness-of-Fit testing. Confidence intervals of the estimated distribution were used to compare additional life expectancy after MVr to the general US population across multiple decades of life. Patients after MVr were categorized by age into decade (range, 20-89 years). RESULTS: The life expectancy of patients after MVr matched the life expectancy of the general US population at any age between 40 and 89 years. Lower-bound one-sided 95% confidence intervals for additional life expectancy were not appreciably different from corresponding median additional life expectancy of the general population. There were few deaths in the 20- to 39-year-old group, limiting predictability, but survival also appeared normative. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that degenerative MVr restores anticipated life expectancy to that of the general population, regardless of age. Although our findings underscore the importance of repair for degenerative mitral disease, larger studies with longer term follow-up are needed to reinforce this finding, particularly for younger patients.

Alcohol septal ablation in patients with severe septal hypertrophy.  ;OBJECTIVE: The current guidelines suggest alcohol septal ablation (ASA) is less effective in hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) patients with severe left ventricular hypertrophy, despite acknowledging that systematic data are lacking. Therefore, we analysed patients in the Euro-ASA registry to test this statement. METHODS: We compared the short-term and long-term outcomes of patients with basal interventricular septum (IVS) thickness <30 mm Hg to those with ≥30 mm Hg treated using ASA in nine European centres. RESULTS: A total of 1519 patients (57±14 years, 49% women) with symptomatic HOCM were treated, including 67 (4.4%) patients with IVS thickness ≥30 mm. The occurrence of short-term major adverse events were similar in both groups. The mean follow-up was 5.4±4.3 years and 5.1±4.1 years, and the all-cause mortality rate was 2.57 and 2.94 deaths per 100 person-years of follow-up in the IVS <30 mm group and the IVS ≥30 mm group (p=0.047), respectively. There were no differences in dyspnoea (New York Heart Association class III/IV 12% vs 16%), residual left ventricular outflow tract gradient (16±20 vs 16±16 mm Hg) and repeated septal reduction procedures (12% vs 18%) in the IVS <30 mm group and IVS ≥30 mm group, respectively (p=NS for all). CONCLUSIONS: The short-term results and the long-term relief of dyspnoea, residual left ventricular outflow obstruction and occurrence of repeated septal reduction procedures in patients with basal IVS ≥30 mm is similar to those with IVS <30mm. However, long-term all-cause and cardiac mortality rates are worse in the ≥30 mm group.

One-stop-shop totally percutaneous approach for severe aortic and mitral regurgitation in cardiogenic shock.  ;"Patients presenting with cardiogenic shock and severe combined aortic and mitral regurgitation represent a major clinical challenge. Therapeutic options are limited in this setting as they are often deemed inoperable due to prohibitive risk for surgery, while mechanical circulatory support is usually contraindicated or technically challenging. Medical therapy, on the other hand, is associated with high-mortality rates. Therefore, percutaneous therapies may represent an appealing alternative. Here, we present a ""one-stop-shop"" totally percutaneous approach for severe aortic and mitral regurgitation in a patient with cardiogenic shock.  "
Endovascular Repair of Ruptured Ascending Aorta Secondary to Embolized Transcatheter Aortic Valve.  ;Since its approval by the United States Food and Drug Administration in 2011, transcatheter aortic valve replacement has revolutionized the treatment of aortic valvular disease with a rapid increase in use. Potentially fatal aortic complications are rare, occurring in 0.2% to 1.1% of cases-all reported in the early perioperative period. We present a case of a late ascending aortic pseudoaneurysm with rupture secondary to erosion by an embolized transcatheter aortic valve occurring 6 years after implantation. The patient was successfully treated with a commercially available, off-the-shelf aortic endograft.

Aortic valve replacement for infective endocarditis in an adult with uncorrected tetralogy of Fallot and pulmonary atresia.  ;"Infective endocarditis is one of the complications encountered in patients with uncorrected tetralogy of Fallot; however, there have been only limited reports on surgical treatment of this condition. A 38-year-old man with uncorrected tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary atresia previously palliated with modified Blalock-Taussig shunt was diagnosed with aortic valve infective endocarditis and developed severe aortic regurgitation. He underwent urgent aortic valve replacement, during which intermittent hypothermic circulatory arrest was necessary to achieve adequate myocardial protection and bloodless surgical field due to massive arterial return into the left ventricle from the collateral pulmonary circulation.

Computed tomography for transcatheter tricuspid valve development.  ;"BACKGROUND: Patients with severe symptomatic tricuspid regurgitation (TR) are often deemed ineligible for surgical valve repair due to comorbidities. In this setting, transcatheter tricuspid valve replacement (TTVR) is undergoing development, but delivery technique and prosthesis design have yet to be optimized. We sought to assess the challenges of TTVR and the determinants of venous route using computed tomography (CT) analysis. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 195 end-diastolic cardiac CT performed prior to surgical correction of a severe TR (n = 38), transcatheter aortic valve replacement (n = 89), or left atrial appendage closure (n = 68) were analyzed. Patients with TR (n = 68; 19 primary and 49 secondary) were compared with patients without (n = 127). Continuous variables with normal and non-normal distributions were compared using Student t test or Mann-Whitney test respectively. The angle from the tricuspid annulus (TA) to the inferior vena cava was tighter (mean = 101 ± 18°) with a broader range of value (44° to 164°) than to the superior vena cava (mean = 143 ± 9°). Patients with TR had rounder TA (eccentricity index of 0.88 ± 0.08, p < 0.001), with a larger area (p < 0.0001), and septolateral (45.3 ± 8.0 mm, p < 0.0001) and anteroposterior (44.4 ± 7.4 mm, p < 0.0001) diameters than patients without. The distances from the TA to the coronary sinus, the right ventricular outflow tract, and the moderator band were respectively 11.4 ± 3.8 mm, 17.2 ± 3.4 mm, and 31.0 ± 6.7 mm, without differences between groups. CONCLUSION: The transjugular access for TTVR is straighter and more reproducible than the transfemoral access. Prosthesis development may be challenged by the close position of the coronary sinus, the presence of a moderator band, and the large TA size of patients with severe TR. KEY POINTS: • The tricuspid annulus is larger in patients with severe tricuspid regurgitation, confirming existing data. • The coronary sinus ostium is close to the tricuspid annulus, requiring a prosthesis with a short atrial length. • The transjugular venous route may be the preferred access to the tricuspid annulus, straighter with less inter-individual variations than the transfemoral route.

Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in Low-Risk Patients: A Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.  ;"INTRODUCTION: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has become the standard treatment option for patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis (AS) with high surgical risk and a reasonable option for intermediate surgical risk as an alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). The role of TAVR in lower risk patients is less established but has been the focus of recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs). We performed a meta-analysis of RCTs to assess TAVR outcomes among low surgical risk patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: Systematic search of RCTs was done using PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases. Statistical analysis was performed with RevMan v5.3 software using a random effects model to report risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). A total of three RCTs including 2698 patients (1375 TAVR and 1323 SAVR) were analyzed. Compared to SAVR, TAVR was not associated with all-cause mortality [RR 0.86 (95% CI 0.61-1.19); P = 0.36; I2 = 8%] or stroke [RR 0.82 (0.48-1.43); P = 0.49; I2 = 42%]. However, TAVR was significantly associated with lower risk of acute kidney injury [RR 0.27 (0.13-0.54); P = 0.0002; I2 = 0%], new-onset atrial fibrillation [RR 0.26 (0.18-0.39); P < 0.00001; I2 = 80%], and life-threatening or disabling bleeding [RR 0.35 (0.22-0.55); P < 0.00001; I2 = 57%], but a higher risk of moderate-severe paravalvular leak [RR 4.40 (1.22-15.86); P = 0.02; I2 = 26%] and permanent pacemaker insertion [RR 2.73 (1.41-5.28); P = 0.003; I2 = 83%]. CONCLUSIONS: There is no difference in all-cause mortality or stroke between TAVR and SAVR, but TAVR is associated with lower risk of other perioperative complications except for moderate-severe paravalvular leak and the need for permanent pacemaker implantation.

Echocardiographic assessment of mitral regurgitation.  ;Mitral regurgitation (MR) is one of the most frequent indications for valve surgery in developed countries, and echocardiographic assessment is an essential tool to evaluate its etiologies, severity, and therapeutic indications. The mitral valve apparatus is a complex structure composed of several parts: apart from the mitral valve leaflets and annulus, it also includes the chordae tendineae, papillary muscles, and left ventricular (LV) wall. MR can be caused not only by organic changes of the mitral valve leaflets or chordae (primary MR) but also by extreme mitral annular enlargement or mitral leaflet tethering due to displacement and malfunction of papillary muscles and LV wall (secondary MR). In secondary MR with LV dysfunction, a milder degree of MR can be associated with adverse outcomes compared with primary MR. Grading the severity is the first step in evaluation of indication for surgical/transcatheter interventions. As such, there are several techniques to assess the severity of MR using echocardiography. However, none of the techniques is reliable enough by itself, and it is always recommended to integrate multiple methods. In cases where echocardiographic assessment of MR severity is inconclusive, magnetic resonance may be helpful. In addition to the severity, anatomical information, such as localization in primary MR due to mitral valve prolapse and LV size in secondary MR due to LV dilatation/dysfunction, is an important concern in presurgical echocardiography. Transesophageal echocardiography and three-dimensional echocardiography are key techniques for anatomical evaluation including mitral valve and LV volumes. In transcatheter intervention for MR, echocardiography plays a pivotal role as a guide for procedures and endpoints. In this review article, the authors provide a comprehensive summary of current standards of echocardiographic assessment of MR.  
Valve-in-Ring Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement After Left Ventricular Assist Device Therapy.  ;Aortic regurgitation after left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation is a well-described problem that decreases the clinical effectiveness of LVAD therapy and may eventually prompt consideration of aortic valve replacement once the regurgitation becomes severe. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement is an attractive, less invasive option compared with surgical aortic valve replacement in these patients. We report a valve-in-ring transcatheter aortic valve replacement for a patient with severe aortic regurgitation associated with LVAD destination therapy. Our case demonstrates that this approach is feasible in humans and can yield excellent clinical results.

Early Structural Valve Deterioration of Tricuspid Pericardial Valve Caused by Native Valve Adhesion.  ;Although preservation of the subvalvular apparatus affects left ventricular function and late outcome in mitral valve replacement, there are some reports of early structural valve deterioration caused by the adhesion of native valves. We report the case of a 41-year-old woman who developed early structural valve deterioration after tricuspid valve replacement caused by the adhesion of native valves. It is a rare complication, but one to consider upon observing early rising of the pressure gradient or symptoms after tricuspid valve replacement like mitral valve replacement.  
Tricuspid regurgitation severity after atrial septal defect closure or pulmonic valve replacement.  ;OBJECTIVES: Cardiac surgery or catheter interventions are nowadays commonly performed to reduce volume loading of the right ventricle in adults with congenital heart disease. However, little is known, on the effect of such procedures on pre-existing tricuspid regurgitation (TR). We assessed the potential reduction in the severity of TR after atrial septal defect (ASD) closure and pulmonic valve replacement (PVR). METHODS: Demographics, clinical and echocardiographic characteristics of consecutive patients undergoing ASD closure or PVR between 2005 and 2014 at a single centre who had at least mild preoperative TR were collected and analysed. RESULTS: Overall, 162 patients (mean age at intervention 41.6±16.1 years, 38.3% male) were included: 101 after ASD closure (61 transcatheter vs 40 surgical) and 61 after PVR (3 transcatheter vs 58 surgical). Only 11.1% received concomitant tricuspid valve surgery (repair). There was significant reduction in the severity of TR in the overall population, from 38 (23.5%) patients having moderate or severe TR preoperatively to only 11 (6.8%) and 20 (12.3%) at 6 months and 12 months of follow-up, respectively (McNemar p<0.0001). There was a significant reduction in tricuspid valve annular diameter (p<0.0001), coaptation distance (p<0.0001) and systolic tenting area (p<0.0001). The reduction in TR was also observed in patients who did not have concomitant tricuspid valve (TV) repair (from 15.3% to 6.9% and 11.8% at 6 and 12 months, respectively, p<0.0001). On multivariable logistic regression including all univariable predictors of residual TR at 12 months, only RA area remained in the model (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.37, p=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: ASD closure and PVR are associated with a significant reduction in tricuspid regurgitation, even among patients who do not undergo concomitant tricuspid valve surgery.

Prevalence of atrial fibrillation before cardiac surgery and factors associated with concomitant ablation.  ;OBJECTIVE: Surgical ablation for atrial fibrillation concomitant with cardiac surgery is now a Class I recommendation for selected patients. Understanding how the revised recommendations will affect appropriate use of surgical ablation is challenging because the reported prevalence of preoperative atrial fibrillation depends on the definition used. The objective was to determine the prevalence of atrial fibrillation in the 3 years before cardiac surgery and the rate of concomitant surgical ablation. METHODS: Patients with and without a diagnosis of atrial fibrillation in the 3 years before surgical coronary artery bypass, aortic valve replacement, or mitral valve replacement/repair were identified in the 2014 Medicare Standard Analytical File. RESULTS: Patients had prior atrial fibrillation in 28.4% of 79,134 cardiac surgeries. Prior atrial fibrillation was associated with risk factors for increased cardiac surgical morbidity/mortality, including recent heart failure, renal failure, and lung disease. Black patients were less likely to have prior atrial fibrillation but more likely to have had infrequent care for it. Isolated coronary artery bypass had the lowest prevalence but highest absolute number of prior atrial fibrillation cases. Concomitant surgical ablation was performed in 22.1% of patients with prior atrial fibrillation. Patients with mitral valve surgery were 3-fold more likely to receive surgical ablation. Women were less likely to have prior atrial fibrillation but less likely to have surgical ablation when they did. CONCLUSIONS: Medicare beneficiaries had a substantially higher prevalence of atrial fibrillation diagnoses in the 3 years before cardiac surgery than previously published rates of preoperative atrial fibrillation. Concomitant surgical ablation was performed in less than one-quarter of patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing cardiac surgery for other indications.

Atrial fibrillation is not an independent predictor of outcome in patients with aortic stenosis.  ;"OBJECTIVES: To examine the prognostic significance of atrial fibrillation (AF) versus sinus rhythm (SR) on the management and outcomes of patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS). METHODS: 1847 consecutive patients with severe AS (aortic valve area ≤1.0 cm2 and aortic valve systolic mean Doppler gradient ≥40 mm Hg or peak velocity ≥4 m/s) and left ventricular ejection fraction ≥50% were identified. The independent association of AF and all-cause mortality was assessed. RESULTS: Age was 76±11 years and 46% were female; 293 (16%) patients had AF and 1554 (84%) had SR. In AF, 72% were symptomatic versus 71% in SR. Survival rate at 5 years for AF (41%) was lower than SR (65%) (age- and sex-adjusted HR=1.66 (1.40-1.98), p<0.0001). In multivariable analysis, factors associated with mortality included age (HR per 10 years=1.55 (1.42-1.69), p<0.0001), dyspnoea (HR=1.58 (1.33-1.87), p<0.0001), ≥ moderate mitral regurgitation (HR=1.63 (1.22-2.18), p=0.001), right ventricular systolic dysfunction (HR=1.88 (1.52-2.33), p<0.0001), left atrial volume index (HR per 10 mL/m2=1.13 (1.07-1.19), p<0.0001) and aortic valve replacement (AVR) (HR=0.44 (0.38-0.52), p<0.0001). AF was not a predictor of mortality independent of variables strongly correlated HR=1.02 (0.84-1.25), p=0.81). The 1-year probability of AVR following diagnosis of severe AS was lower in AF (49.8%) than SR (62.5%) (HR=0.73 (0.62-0.86), p<0.001); among patients with AF not referred for AVR, symptoms were frequently attributed to AF instead of AS. CONCLUSION: AF was associated with poor prognosis in patients with severe AS, but apparent differences in outcomes compared with SR were explained by factors other than AF including concomitant cardiac abnormalities and deferral of AVR due to attribution of cardiac symptoms to AF.

Paravalvular leak closure of acute mitral valve ring dehiscence during mitral valve-in-ring procedure.  ;The replacement of surgically corrected mitral valves, also known as percutaneous transcatheter repair, is a relatively young field. Even though these procedures are usually successful, they can present significant intraoperative or postoperative challenges. To our knowledge, we present the first case of acute focal dehiscence of mitral ring repair during the mitral valve-in-ring procedure.  
Three-dimensional echocardiography investigation of the mechanisms of tricuspid annular dilatation.  ;"Tricuspid annular (TA) size, assessed by 2D transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), has a well-established prognostic value in patients undergoing mitral valve surgery, with TA dilatation triggering simultaneous tricuspid annuloplasty. While TA dilatation is common in patients with dilated atria secondary to atrial fibrillation, little is known about the mechanisms of TA dilatation in patients with sinus rhythm (SR). This study aimed to identify echocardiographic parameters most closely related to the TA size as a potential tool for identification of patients prone to developing TA enlargement. 120 patients with SR underwent clinically indicated TTE, including 30 patients with normal hearts and 90 patients diagnosed with at least one right heart abnormality, defined as: right ventricular (RV) or right atrial (RA) dilatation, ≥ moderate tricuspid regurgitation (TR) and elevated systolic pulmonary artery pressure (sPAP). RA and RV end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes (EDV, ESV) and function were measured using commercial 3D software (TomTec). 3D RV long and short axes were used as surrogate indices of RV shape. Degrees of TR and sPAP were estimated by 2D TTE. 3D TA sizing was performed at end-diastole using 3D custom software. Linear regression analysis was used to identify variables best correlated with TA size, followed by multivariate analysis to identify independent associations. The highest correlations were found between TA area and: RA ESV (r = 0.73; p < 0.01), RV EDV (r = 0.58; p < 0.01), RV end-diastolic long and short axes (r = 0.53, 0.42; both p < 0.01), TR degree (r = 0.40; p < 0.01) and sPAP (r = 0.32; p < 0.01). Multivariate analysis revealed that RA ESV was the only parameter independently associated with TA area (p < 0.05, r = 0.85). In conclusion, RA volume plays an important role in TA dilatation even in patients with normal SR. Understanding of annular remodeling mechanisms could aid in identifying patients at higher risk for TA dilatation, especially those scheduled for mitral valve surgery.  "

METHODS: An observational retrospective cohort study in patients with infective endocarditis was performed in a public hospital in Spain from January 2013 to December 2017. RESULTS: Seventy-two patients were treated: 26 (36.1%) were under 65 years old, 28 (38.9%) were 65-79 years old, and 18 (25%) were aged 80 or older. Prosthetic valve endocarditis was less common in patients aged 65-79 years (3.6%) than in younger (23.1%; p = 0.047) or older (38.9%; p = 0.004) patients. In contrast, degenerative heart disease was more prevalent in the 65-79 year age group [64.3% compared to 15.4% (p < 0.001) in the youngest group, and 33.3% (p = 0.04) in the oldest]. Surgical interventions were similar in patients aged 65-79 (50%) and under 65 years (42.3%), but less common in people over 80 years (16.7%; p = 0.022).

Subtypes of Atrial Functional Mitral Regurgitation: Imaging Insights Into Their Mechanisms and Therapeutic Implications.  ;"Functional mitral regurgitation (MR) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) without left ventricular dysfunction, namely, atrial functional MR, has been increasingly recognized. Whether mitral annular dilatation causes MR in patients without left ventricular dysfunction has remained controversial; however, recent studies using novel imaging technologies, including 3-dimensional echocardiography, have shown that significant functional MR can sometimes occur in AF patients with significant dilatation of mitral annulus and left atrium. Additional contributors such as atriogenic leaflet tethering, annulus area to leaflet area imbalance resulting from insufficient leaflet remodeling and reduced annular contractility, increased valve stress by flattened saddle shape of the annulus, and left atrial dysfunction may be important triggers of atrial functional MR in the presence of dilated mitral annulus and left atrium. The prevalence of atrial functional MR is reported to be between 3% and 15% in AF patients and those with atrial functional MR are associated with worse clinical outcomes. Because there are few published data regarding therapeutic strategies of atrial functional MR, understanding the principles of therapeutic options and their target mechanisms is important with regards to clinical practice until sufficient evidence is established. In this review, the known mechanisms, clinical implications and, when possible, potential therapeutic options of atrial functional MR are discussed.  "
Impact of facilities accredited by both adult and pediatric cardiology societies on the outcome of patients with adult congenital heart disease.  ;"BACKGROUND: The emerging burden and need of hospital admission due to adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) will need many facilities with expertise in ACHD. Regional specialized ACHD centers are carrying this increasing patient burden. Although these centers are considered to perform better management than other institutes, their impact on outcome has not been fully evaluated. METHODS: We used the Japanese Registry of All cardiac and vascular Diseases (JROAD) and the JROAD Diagnosis Procedure Combination (DPC)/Per Diem Payment System dataset and certification data. We only analyzed adult (≥15 years old) patients with ACHD, defined by the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, diagnosis codes, between April 1, 2013, and March 31, 2014. We defined a ""minimal essential regional ACHD (MER-ACHD) center"" as an education institute accredited by adult and pediatric cardiology societies. The primary outcome is 30-day mortality. We investigated the impact of MER-ACHD centers on 30-day mortality by using generalized estimating equations. RESULTS: Of the 538 hospitals registered at JROAD that agreed to participate in the DPC discharge database study, 65 (12.1%) were MER-ACHD centers. Of 4818 patients (46.8% male; age, 50.1±21.4 years), 45.5% were admitted to a MER-ACHD center. Nearly half (48.1%) of the admissions were cases of atrial septal defect, followed by ventricular septal defect, tetralogy of Fallot, and congenital insufficiency of the aortic valve or bicuspid aortic valve. Multivariate analysis revealed a negative impact of emergency admission [1.051 (1.042-1.061)] and a positive impact of MER-ACHD centers [0.986 (0.973-0.999)] on 30-day mortality after adjustment of disease severity. CONCLUSION: We noted the impact of MER-ACHD centers on 30-day mortality. Further investigation is needed to establish appropriate regional ACHD center criteria to deliver appropriate ACHD management.  "

Impact of diastolic dysfunction on long-term mortality and quality of life after transcatheter aortic valve replacement.  ;"BACKGROUND: There is conflicting data as to whether diastolic dysfunction (DD) affects the prognosis of patients with aortic stenosis (AS) undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). METHODS: Consecutive patients undergoing TAVR underwent assessment of DD with preoperative echocardiography and NT-pro BNP. Long-term survival was ascertained every 6 months by clinic visits or phone. DD was graded according to the new American Society of Echocardiography recommendations. Health status was assessed at baseline and 30 days post-procedure using the KCCQ-12 questionnaire. Long-term survival was displayed using Kaplan-Meier curves according to NT-pro BNP levels and DD grades. RESULTS: We included 222 patients, mean age 78 (±8) years, median STS score 4 (interquartile range = 3-7), median follow-up time 385 days (IQR = 180-640). DD was absent in 25, Grade I in 13, Grade II in 74, Grade III in 24, and indeterminate in 86 patients. Advanced (Grades II-III) DD was associated with higher pre-procedural NT-pro BNP levels (p < .001), worse quality of life (p < .001) but similar surgical risk (p = .43). Advanced and indeterminate DD were associated with increased long-term mortality (25-28% vs. 5%, p = .02) and elevated NT-pro BNP levels (26.4% vs. 9.8%, p = .05). Improvements in quality of life measures were seen in all DD groups (median change in KCCQ score no or Grade I DD:14 [3-21] vs. Grades II-III DD: 15 [16-26; p = .37]). CONCLUSION: Preoperative NT-pro BNP levels and echocardiographic indices of indeterminate or advanced DD are associated with increased long-term mortality after TAVR but similar improvements in quality of life.

Low dose contrast CT for transcatheter aortic valve replacement assessment: Results from the prospective SPECTACULAR study (spectral CT assessment prior to TAVR).  ;"BACKGROUND: Computed tomographic angiography (CTA) based planning for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is essential for reduction of periprocedural complications. Spectral CT based imaging provides several advantages, including better contrast/signal to noise ratio and increased soft tissue contrast, permitting better delineation of contrast filled structures at lower doses of iodinated contrast media. The aim of this prospective study was to assess the initial feasibility of a low dose iodinated contrast protocol, utilizing monoenergetic 40 keV reconstruction, using a dual-layer CT scanner (DLCT) for CTA in patients undergoing TAVR planning. METHODS: 116 consecutive TAVR patients underwent a gated chest and a non-gated CTA of the abdomen and pelvis. 40 keV virtual monoenergetic images (VMI) were reconstructed and compared with conventional polychromatic images (CI). The proximal aorta and access vessels were scored for image quality by independent experienced cardiovascular imagers. RESULTS: Proximal aortic image quality as assessed by signal to noise (SNR) and contrast to noise ratio (CNR), were significantly better with 40 keV VMI relative to CI (SNR 14.65 ± 7.37 vs 44.16 ± 22.39, p < 0.001; CNR 15.84 ± 9.93 vs 59.8 ± 40.83, p < 0.001). Aortic root dimensions were comparable between the two approaches with a bias towards higher measurements at 40 keV (Bland Altman). SNR and CNR in all access vessel segments at 40 keV were substantially better (p < 0.001 for all peripheral access vessel segments) with comparable image quality. CONCLUSION: 40 keV VMI with low dose contrast dose spectral imaging is feasible for comprehensive preprocedural evaluation of access vessels and measurements of aortic root dimensions in patients undergoing TAVR.

Left ventricular mass regression in patients without patient-prosthesis mismatch after aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis.  ;OBJECTIVES: The relationship between the degree of a postoperative effective orifice area and temporal regression of a left ventricular mass after aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis is unclear in patients without patient-prosthesis mismatch. We therefore investigated the relationship and independent predictors of left ventricular mass regression. METHODS: Among 307 consecutive patients who underwent aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis between 2008 and 2013, 223 patients receiving a periodic inspection by echocardiography for at least 3 consecutive years after surgery without patient-prosthesis mismatch were enrolled in the present study. Temporal regression of left ventricular mass index was compared between two groups that were classified equally according to effective orifice area index obtained at a 1-week postoperative echocardiographic examination: < 1.20 cm2/m2 (n = 112) and > 1.20 cm2/m2 (n = 111). We also determined the predictors affecting left ventricular mass regression. RESULTS: No difference existed in the preoperative left ventricular mass index between the two groups (p = 0.431). Temporal regression of the left ventricular mass index was similar in the two groups. The independent predictors of left ventricular mass regression were male gender (p = 0.007) and preoperative left ventricular mass index (p = 0.003), but valve size was not (p = 0.641). CONCLUSIONS: There was no relationship between the degree of postoperative effective orifice area and temporal regression of the left ventricular mass in patients without patient-prosthesis mismatch. The independent predictors of left ventricular mass regression were male gender and preoperative left ventricular mass index.  
Aortic regurgitation assessment by cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging and transthoracic echocardiography: intermodality disagreement impacting on prediction of post-surgical left ventricular remodeling.  ;"Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is the primary clinical imaging modality for the assessment of patients with isolated aortic regurgitation (AR) in whom TTE's linear left ventricular (LV) dimension is used to assess disease severity to guide aortic valve replacement (AVR), yet TTE is relatively limited with regards to its integrated semi-quantitative/qualitative approach. We therefore compared TTE and cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) assessment of isolated AR and investigated each modality's ability to predict LV remodeling after AVR. AR severity grading by CMR and TTE were compared in 101 consecutive patients referred for CMR assessment of chronic AR. LV end-diastolic diameter and end-systolic diameter measurements by both modalities were compared. Twenty-four patients subsequently had isolated AVR. The pre-AVR estimates of regurgitation severity by CMR and TTE were correlated with favorable post-AVR LV remodeling. AR severity grade agreement between CMR and TTE was moderate (ρ = 0.317, P = 0.001). TTE underestimated CMR LV end-diastolic and LV end-systolic diameter by 6.6 mm (P < 0.001, CI 5.8-7.7) and 5.9 mm (P < 0.001, CI 4.1-7.6), respectively. The correlation of post-AVR LV remodeling with CMR AR grade (ρ = 0.578, P = 0.004) and AR volumes (R = 0.664, P < 0.001) was stronger in comparison to TTE (ρ = 0.511, P = 0.011; R = 0.318, P = 0.2). In chronic AR, CMR provides more prognostic relevant information than TTE in assessing AR severity. CMR should be considered in the management of chronic AR patients being considered for AVR.  "

Interdisciplinary consensus on indications for transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TF-TAVI) : Joint Consensus Document of the Arbeitsgemeinschaft Leitende Kardiologische Krankenhausärzte e.V. (ALKK) and cooperating Cardiac Surgery Departments.  ;Indications for TF-TAVI (transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation) are rapidly changing according to increasing evidence from randomized controlled trials. Present trials document the non-inferiority or even superiority of TF-TAVI in intermediate-risk patients (STS-Score 4-8%) as well as in low-risk patients (STS-Score < 4%). However, risk scores exhibit limitations and, as a single criterion, are unable to establish an appropriate indication of TF-TAVI vs transapical TAVI vs SAVR (surgical aortic valve replacement). The ESC (European Society of Cardiology)/EACTS (European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery) guidelines 2017 and the German DGK (Deutsche Gesellschaft für Kardiologie)/DGTHG (Deutsche Gesellschaft für Thorax-, Herz- und Gefäßchirurgie) commentary 2018 offer a framework for the selection of the best therapeutic method, but the individual decision is left to the discretion of the heart teams. An interdisciplinary TAVI consensus group of interventional cardiologists of the ALKK (Arbeitsgemeinschaft Leitende Kardiologische Krankenhausärzte e.V.) and cardiac surgeons has developed a detailed consensus on the indications for TF-TAVI to provide an up-to-date, evidence-based, comprehensive decision matrix for daily practice. The matrix of indication criteria includes age, risk scores, contraindications against SAVR (e.g., porcelain aorta), cardiovascular criteria pro TAVI, additional criteria pro TAVI (e.g., frailty, comorbidities, organ dysfunction), contraindications against TAVI (e.g., endocarditis) and cardiovascular criteria pro SAVR (e.g., bicuspid valve anatomy). This interdisciplinary consensus may provide orientation to heart teams for individual TAVI-indication decisions. Future adaptations according to evolving medical evidence are to be expected.

A simple method to visualize the bicuspid aortic valve pathology by cardiac computed tomography.  ;Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) disease is a spectrum of anomalies ranging from mild underdevelopment of a commissure to severe underdevelopment of two interleaflets triangles. Many different classifications of BAV, based on the echocardiographic, surgical or pathological appearance of the valve, and more recently on cardiac CT, have been proposed. We describe a simple technique, based on three-dimensional curved multiplanar reconstruction images, to obtain a pathology-like visualization of the full line of insertion (Hinge) of the aortic valve leaflets and of the interleaflet triangles with cardiac CT. This method could help to obtain a detailed categorization of any specific BAV anatomy based on the degree of underdevelopment (or on the absence) of one interleaflet triangle. Adherence to this concept could help to improve the imaging based analysis of BAV patients undergoing TAVR, and could lead to the adoption of a BAV classification based on the effective pathologic appearance of the valve also for patients undergoing TAVR.

Correlation between non-invasive myocardial work indices and main parameters of systolic and diastolic function: results from the EACVI NORRE study.  ;AIMS: The present study sought to evaluate the correlation between indices of non-invasive myocardial work (MW) and left ventricle (LV) size, traditional and advanced parameters of LV systolic and diastolic function by 2D echocardiography (2DE). METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 226 (85 men, mean age: 45 ± 13 years) healthy subjects were enrolled at 22 collaborating institutions of the Normal Reference Ranges for Echocardiography (NORRE) study. Global work index (GWI), global constructive work (GCW), global work waste (GWW), and global work efficiency (GWE) were estimated from LV pressure-strain loops using custom software. Peak LV pressure was estimated non-invasively from brachial artery cuff pressure. LV size, parameters of systolic and diastolic function and ventricular-arterial coupling were measured by echocardiography. As advanced indices of myocardial performance, global longitudinal strain (GLS), global circumferential strain (GCS), and global radial strain (GRS) were obtained. On multivariable analysis, GWI was significantly correlated with GLS (standardized beta-coefficient = -0.23, P < 0.001), ejection fraction (EF) (standardized beta-coefficient = 0.15, P = 0.02), systolic blood pressure (SBP) (standardized beta-coefficient = 0.56, P < 0.001) and GRS (standardized beta-coefficient = 0.19, P = 0.004), while GCW was correlated with GLS (standardized beta-coefficient = -0.55, P < 0.001), SBP (standardized beta-coefficient = 0.71, P < 0.001), GRS (standardized beta-coefficient = 0.11, P = 0.02), and GCS (standardized beta-coefficient = -0.10, P = 0.01). GWE was directly correlated with EF and inversely correlated with Tei index (standardized beta-coefficient = 0.18, P = 0.009 and standardized beta-coefficient = -0.20, P = 0.004, respectively), the opposite occurred for GWW (standardized beta-coefficient =--0.14, P = 0.03 and standardized beta-coefficient = 0.17, P = 0.01, respectively). CONCLUSION: The non-invasive MW indices show a good correlation with traditional 2DE parameters of myocardial systolic function and myocardial strain.  
Does isolated mitral annular calcification in the absence of mitral valve disease affect clinical outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve replacement?  ;AIMS : Mitral annular calcification (MAC) has been associated with adverse outcomes in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) but has been investigated in isolation of co-existent mitral regurgitation or mitral stenosis, which may represent important confounders. This study sought to investigate the effect of MAC with and without concomitant mitral valve disease (MVD) on clinical outcomes in patients treated with TAVR. METHODS AND RESULTS : Computed tomography (CT) and echocardiographic data in consecutive TAVR patients enrolled into a prospective registry were categorized according to presence or absence of severe MAC and significant MVD, respectively. A total of 967 patients with adequate CT and echocardiography data were included between 2007 and 2017. Severe MAC was found in 172 patients (17.8%) and associated with MVD in 87 patients (50.6%). Compared to TAVR patients without severe MAC or MVD, all-cause mortality at 1 year was significantly increased among patients with severe MAC in combination with MVD [adjusted hazard ratio (HRadj): 1.97, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.12-3.44, P = 0.018] and patients with isolated MVD (HRadj: 2.33, 95% CI: 1.56-3.47, P < 0.001), but not in patients with isolated severe MAC in the absence of MVD (HRadj: 0.52, 95% CI: 0.21-1.33, P = 0.173). CONCLUSION : We found no effect of isolated MAC on clinical outcomes following TAVR in patients with preserved mitral valve function. Patients with MVD had an increased risk of death at 1 year irrespective of MAC.

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement outcomes in mixed aortic valve disease compared to predominant aortic stenosis.  ;BACKGROUND: MAVD, defined as severe aortic stenosis with moderate or severe aortic regurgitation, is frequently encountered in clinical practice. However, the data regarding TAVR outcomes in MAVD are sparse. We compared Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR) outcomes between Mixed Aortic Valve Disease (MAVD) and Predominant Aortic Stenosis (PAS) patients. METHODS: Patients who underwent TAVR at Mayo Clinic from February 7, 2012 to December 16, 2016 were enrolled. The primary end point was all-cause mortality. Secondary end points were central or paravalvular regurgitation, device success, and Valve Academic Research Consortium (VARC)-2 defined post TAVR complications (access site complications, bleedings, myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiac arrest). RESULTS: A total of 622 patients were enrolled. Mean age was 81 ± 8.9 years, and 263 (42.3%) were female. Median follow-up duration was 1.5 years. One hundred and sixteen patients (18.6%) had MAVD. Central or paravalvular leak was higher in MAVD patients post-TAVR (15.5% vs 6.7%, P = 0.004). Device success and VARC-2 in-hospital complications were similar between the two groups. The cumulative probability of survival at 3 years was 71.3% in MAVD patients vs. 62.6% in PAS patients (Log-Rank P = 0.024). In a multi-variant logistic regression analysis, MAVD was an independent negative predictor of all-cause mortality (HR = 0.53, 95% CI 0.3-0.89, P = 0.015). CONCLUSIONS: A significant number of patients referred for TAVR have MAVD disease. Despite higher rates of paravalvular regurgitation, all-cause mortality at mid-term was lower in patients with MAVD compared with those with PAS. Our results show the safety and efficacy of TAVR in MAVD patients.

Interleukin 4: Its Role in Hypertension, Atherosclerosis, Valvular, and Nonvalvular Cardiovascular Diseases.  ;Hypertension is one of the major physiological risk factors for cardiovascular diseases, and it affects more than 1 billion adults worldwide, killing 9 million people every year according to World Health Organization. Also, hypertension is associated with increased risk of kidney disease and stroke. Studying the risk factors that contribute to the pathogenesis of hypertension is key to preventing and controlling hypertension. Numerous laboratories around to globe are very active pursuing research studies to delineate the factors, such as the role of immune system, which could contribute to hypertension. There are studies that were conducted on immune-deficient mice for which experimentally induced hypertension has been ameliorated. Thus, there are possibilities that immune reactivity could be associated with the development of certain type of hypertension. Furthermore, interleukin 4 has been associated with the development of pulmonary hypertension, which could lead to right ventricular remodeling. Also, the immune system is involved in valvular and nonvalvular cardiac remodeling. It has been demonstrated that there is a causative relationship between different interleukins and cardiac fibrosis.

Percutaneous interventions for mitral and tricuspid heart valve diseases.  ;Percutaneous mitral and tricuspid valve interventions are alternative treatment options for patients who are deemed to be at high surgical risk and/or inoperable. Transcatheter edge-to-edge mitral valve repair using the MitraClip and PASCAL system, which are designed to mimic the surgical Alfieri's stich, has changed the landscape for the treatment of symptomatic functional mitral regurgitation (MR). Previous studies have shown that the procedure can reduce symptoms and improve functional capacity with low rates of complication. Recently, two randomized controlled clinical trials have reported the effect of the MitraClip on outcomes for secondary MR. Next-generation devices, advanced techniques, and additional clinical data would further improve the outcomes following this procedure. Percutaneous direct annuloplasty using the Cardioband system is a relatively new technique that closely resembles surgical annuloplasty. Its role in treating secondary MR as well as its concomitant use with edge-to-edge mitral repair will continue to gain attention. The transapical off-pump mitral valve repair with neochord implantation, known as a NeoChord procedure, is also a new option to implant artificial chords in a minimally invasive manner in MR patients with leaflet prolapse or flail. Transcatheter mitral valve replacement is another emerging treatment option for selected patients. Although the development of transcatheter strategies for tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is still in the early stages, there is growing evidence to support the application of various approaches, including edge-to-edge repair and annuloplasty, to address unmet needs. In this review article, we will summarize the emerging minimally invasive interventions for mitral and tricuspid valves.

Impact of Mitral Surgery for Mitral Regurgitation on Coexisting Aortic Regurgitation.  ;BACKGROUND: There is no clear finding on the course of coexisting aortic regurgitation (AR) after treatment of mitral regurgitation (MR). We investigated the effect of mitral surgery for MR on coexisting AR. METHODS: Between January 2008 and December 2016, 75 patients underwent mitral surgery for MR coexisting mild AR. Of these, 65 patients who were available to follow-up postoperative echocardiographic tests 1 year after surgery were included in the present study. Patients were divided into two groups according to the degree of postoperative AR. We investigated the predictive factors for continued AR and perioperative cardiac function. RESULTS: In all, 22 patients' AR improved and became less than mild and 43 patients' persisted at mild or increased. The predictive factor for continued AR was left atrial diameter >50 mm (P = 0.021, odds ratio = 4.739, 95% confidence interval: 1.259-17.846) in multivariate logistic regression analysis. No patients underwent reoperation for continued AR in both groups. However, one patient was rehospitalized for heart failure in the continued AR group. CONCLUSION: Left atrial diameter may be an important prognostic factor for continued AR after mitral surgery for MR. MR with mild AR should be treated as soon as before the left atrium expands.  
Evaluation of stimulus-effect relations in left ventricular growth using a simple multiscale model.  ;Cardiac growth is the natural capability of the heart to change size in response to changes in blood flow demand of the growing body. Cardiac diseases can trigger the same process leading to an abnormal type of growth. Prediction of cardiac growth would be clinically valuable, but so far published models on cardiac growth differ with respect to the stimulus-effect relation and constraints used for maximum growth. In this study, we use a zero-dimensional, multiscale model of the left ventricle to evaluate cardiac growth in response to three valve diseases, aortic and mitral regurgitation along with aortic stenosis. We investigate how different combinations of stress- and strain-based stimuli affect growth in terms of cavity volume and wall volume and hemodynamic performance. All of our simulations are able to reach a converged state without any growth constraint, with the most promising results obtained while considering at least one stress-based stimulus. With this study, we demonstrate how a simple model of left ventricular mechanics can be used to have a first evaluation on a designed growth law.  
Left atrial mechanics in moderate mitral valve disease: earlier markers of damage.  ;While the impairment of left atrial (LA) mechanics in mitral valve disease is well known, the exact onset of reservoir, conduit, and contractile dysfunction in mitral stenosis (MS) and mitral regurgitation (MR) remains unclear. We aimed to clarify the LA deformation mechanics in patients with moderate mitral valve disease. We conducted a prospective observational study of 80 patients with moderate isolated MR, 80 patients with moderate isolated MS, and 64 age-matched controls without mitral valve disease. Strain (ɛ) and strain rate (SR) on speckle tracking echocardiography were assessed as indicators of LA and right atrium (RA) reservoir (ɛsys, SRs), conduit (ɛe, SRe), and contractile (ɛa, SRa) functions. Conventional echocardiographic parameters of the left ventricle (LV) were also assessed. Comparisons were conducted according to mitral valve pathology (MR patients, MS patients, controls). The mean LV ejection fraction, end-diastolic diameter, and global longitudinal strain did not differ across the groups. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure, LA volume indexed to body surface area, and LA mechanics were significantly impaired in mitral valve disease (patients vs controls). While LA ɛ did not vary between MR and MS, MR patients had better LA SRs and SRe but worse SRa (p < 0.01). SRe > - 0.65% had higher specificity for MS, with an area under the curve of 0.85 (p < 0.01). RA mechanics were significantly impaired in mitral valve disease (patients vs controls) but did not vary significantly with disease pathology (MS vs MR). Patients with moderate mitral valve disease exhibit early and pathology-specific changes in the LA deformation mechanics, manifesting mainly as impaired contractile-phase SR in MR and impaired conduit-phase SR in MS. Our findings highlight SR as a potentially useful early marker of LA dysfunction in relation to mitral valve disease.  
Impact of telephone follow-up and 24/7 hotline on 30-day readmission rates following aortic valve replacement -A randomized controlled trial.  ;BACKGROUND: Thirty-day all-cause readmissions are high after aortic valve replacement (AVR). We aimed to assess the effectiveness of a structured telephone follow-up (TFU) and a 24/7 hotline on reducing 30-day all-cause readmission (30-DACR) after AVR, on reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression and on improving perceived health state. METHODS: A prospective randomized controlled trial was conducted. Patients (n = 288) were randomly allocated to either post-discharge usual care or to care that provided TFU and access to a 24/7 hotline after AVR. Ancillary endpoints were time-to-event (readmission), proportion of avoidable versus unavoidable readmissions after AVR, and predictors of 30-DACR after AVR. RESULTS: 30-DACR was 22.3%. The structured TFU and 24/7 hotline intervention failed to reduce 30-DACR rates after AVR (P = 0.274). Symptoms of anxiety were significantly reduced 30 days after surgery (P = 0.031), an effect that did not persist one year after surgery (P = 0.108). Most readmissions occurred before 15 days post-discharge, and 75% of them were deemed to be unavoidable. Pleural drainage before hospital discharge (P = 0.027) and symptoms of anxiety before surgery (P = 0.003) were predictors of 30-DACR after AVR. CONCLUSION: The TFU and 24/7 hotline had no effect on reducing 30-DACR after AVR. However, we did measure reduced symptoms of anxiety the first month after AVR. Anxiety reduction appeared to be an important target for intervention, because we found it to be a risk factor for readmission. Future research should focus on the effectiveness of interventions to prevent avoidable unplanned readmissions. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrial.gov, NCT02522663.  
A risk prediction model in asymptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis: CURRENT-AS risk score.  ;AIMS: Early aortic valve replacement (AVR) might be beneficial in selected high-risk asymptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS), considering their poor prognosis when managed conservatively. This study aimed to develop and validate a clinical scoring system to predict AS-related events within 1 year after diagnosis in asymptomatic severe AS patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: We analysed 1274 asymptomatic severe AS patients derived from a retrospective multicentre registry enrolling consecutive patients with severe AS in Japan (CURRENT AS registry), who were managed conservatively and completed 1-year follow-up without AVR. From a randomly assigned derivation set (N = 849), we developed CURRENT AS risk score for the AS-related event (a composite of AS-related death and heart failure hospitalization) within 1 year using a multivariable logistic regression model. The risk score comprised independent risk predictors including left ventricular ejection fraction <60%, haemoglobin ≤11.0 g/dL, chronic lung disease (2 points), diabetes mellitus, haemodialysis, and any concomitant valve disease (1 point). The predictive accuracy of the model was good with the area under the curve of 0.79 and 0.77 in the derivation and validation sets (N = 425). In the validation set, the 1-year incidence of AS-related events was much higher in patients with score ≥2 than in patients with score ≤1 (Score 0: 2.2%, Score 1: 1.9%, Score 2: 13.4%, Score 3: 14.3%, and Score ≥4: 22.7%, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The CURRENT-AS risk score integrating clinical and echocardiographic factors well-predicted the risk of AS-related events at 1 year in asymptomatic patients with severe AS and was validated internally.

Early Outcomes of Surgery for Carcinoid Heart Disease.  ;"BACKGROUND: The prognosis of patients with metastatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (NEN) continues to improve with modern oncological therapy. In the subgroup of patients with carcinoid syndrome, the development of carcinoid heart disease (CaHD) severely impacts long term survival. Valve surgery has been demonstrated to improve survival and symptoms in patients with CaHD. We sought to assess the outcomes of surgery for CaHD from a single Neuroendocrine Service. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed outcomes of patients with CaHD and metastatic NEN who underwent valvular surgery over a 4-year period (2012-2016). RESULTS: Twenty (20) patients (mean age 64 years, range 29-77 years), all with metastatic small intestinal NEN treated with somatostatin analogues, underwent surgery. Tumour grade was: G1 (n=8), G2 (n=9), and unknown (n=3). Preoperative New York Heart Association (NYHA) class was III/IV in 15 patients (75%). The valves affected were: tricuspid (n=20; 19 replace, 1 repair), pulmonary (n=14; 14 replace), mitral (n=2; two replace) and aortic valve (n=2; two replace). Concomitant procedures included patent foramen ovale closure (n=9), right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) (n=4) augmentation and coronary artery bypass grafting (n=3). There were two operative deaths (10%) due to right heart and liver failure. At 6 weeks, all surviving patients had symptom improvement (NYHA I/II). Median follow-up was 2±1.5 years (<1 month to 5 years). One asymptomatic patient developed RVOT obstruction after pulmonary replacement. Two patients had valvular recurrence. One and 2-year survival were 74% and 48% respectively. Of 13 late deaths, 12 were cancer-related (two with uncorrected progressive pulmonary regurgitation). CONCLUSIONS: Surgery for CaHD can be performed with satisfactory early results, leading to an improvement of cardiac symptoms, survival and enabling subsequent oncologic treatment. Further studies are required to improve longer term outcomes in these complex patients with CaHD.  "
Safety and efficacy of hybrid vascular closure technique using both a suture- and collagen-mediated closure device after transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation.  ;OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the clinical utility and feasibility of a hybrid technique for obtaining vascular hemostasis by combining a suture- and a collagen-mediated system after transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TF TAVI) in a real-world setting. METHODS: In 75 consecutive TF TAVI procedures, we investigated a hybrid closing method to achieve hemostasis at the large bore puncture site using a combination of one presuture closure system (ProGlide) and one collagen-mediated system (Angio-Seal). Vascular complications at puncture site were recorded until discharge. RESULTS: Successful hemostasis by the hybrid technique was achieved in 74 out of 75 patients, and the method was well tolerated by all patients. In 73 patients, (97.3%) neither puncture site related complications nor serious early or late bleedings were observed during a median hospital stay of 2 days postprocedure. CONCLUSION: This single-center registry study indicates that a percutaneous hybrid closure technique is safe and efficacious in closing large bore arteriotomies. It is an easy and reliable technique that may contribute to simplifying TAVI procedures. STUDY REGISTRATION: The data was collected from an internal quality control registry on treatment of patients with valvular heart disease with or without coronary artery disease, No 2014/17280, Oslo University Hospital, Ullevål.  
Interplay of cardiac remodelling and myocardial stiffness in hypertensive heart disease: a shear wave imaging study using high-frame rate echocardiography.  ;"AIMS: To determine myocardial stiffness by means of measuring the velocity of naturally occurring myocardial shear waves (SWs) at mitral valve closure (MVC) and investigate their changes with myocardial remodelling in patients with hypertensive heart disease. METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirty-three treated arterial hypertension (HT) patients with hypertrophic left ventricular (LV) remodelling (59 ± 14 years, 55% male) and 26 aged matched healthy controls (55±15 years, 77% male) were included. HT patients were further divided into a concentric remodelling (HT1) group (13 patients) and a concentric hypertrophy (HT2) group (20 patients). LV parasternal long-axis views were acquired with an experimental ultrasound scanner at 1266 ± 317 frames per seconds. The SW velocity induced by MVC was measured from myocardial acceleration maps. SW velocities differed significantly between HT patients and controls (5.83 ± 1.20 m/s vs. 4.04 ± 0.96 m/s; P < 0.001). In addition, the HT2 group had the highest SW velocities (P < 0.001), whereas values between controls and the HT1 group were comparable (P = 0.075). Significant positive correlations were found between SW velocity and LV remodelling (interventricular septum thickness: r = 0.786, P < 0.001; LV mass index: r = 0.761, P < 0.001). SW velocity normalized for wall stress indicated that myocardial stiffness in the HT2 group was twice as high as in controls (P < 0.001), whereas values of the HT1 group overlapped with the controls (P = 1.00). CONCLUSIONS: SW velocity as measure of myocardial stiffness is higher in HT patients compared with healthy controls, particularly in advanced hypertensive heart disease. Patients with concentric remodelling have still normal myocardial properties whereas patients with concentric hypertrophy show significant stiffening.  "
Aortic valve replacement-induced changes in native T1 are related to prognosis in severe aortic stenosis: T1 mapping cardiac magnetic resonance imaging study.  ;"AIMS: Native T1 times from T1 mapping cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) are associated with myocardial fibrosis in aortic stenosis (AS). We investigated whether changing patterns in native T1 predict clinical outcomes after aortic valve replacement (AVR) in severe AS patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: Forty-three patients with severe AS (65.9 ± 8.1 years; 24 men) who underwent T1 mapping CMR at baseline and 1 year after AVR were prospectively enrolled. Upper limit of native T1 from healthy volunteers was used to define normal myocardium and diffuse fibrosis (native T1 < 1208.4 and ≥1208.4 ms, respectively). Participants were categorized into Group 1 (pre- and post-AVR normal myocardium; n = 11), Group 2 (pre-AVR diffuse fibrosis and post-AVR normal myocardium; n = 18), and Group 3 (post-AVR diffuse fibrosis; n = 14). Native T1 significantly decreased 1 year after AVR (pre-AVR, 1233.8 ± 49.7 ms; post-AVR, 1189.1 ± 58.4 ms; P < 0.001), which was associated with left ventricular (LV) mass regression (△native T1 vs. △LV mass index, r = 0.454, P = 0.010) and systolic function improvement (△native T1 vs. △LV ejection fraction, r = -0.379, P = 0.012). Group 2 showed greater functional improvements, whereas these benefits were blunted in Group 3. Group 3 had significantly worse outcomes than Group 1 [hazard ratio (HR), 9.479, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.176-76.409; P = 0.035] and Group 2 (HR 3.551, 95% CI 1.178-10.704; P = 0.024). CONCLUSION: AVR-induced changes in native T1 values are associated with LV systolic functional changes as well as prognosis in severe AS. Post-AVR T1 mapping CMR can be used as an imaging biomarker.

Warfarin induced leukocytoclastic vasculitis: an extraordinary side effect.  ;Warfarin is one of the most commonly used anticoagulants in the management of thromboembolic events. Herein we report a rare case of warfarin induced leukocytoclastic vasculitis in a patient with history of rheumatic heart disease and a mechanical mitral valve prosthesis who presented with heart failure and palpable purpura. Upon clinical suspicion of cutaneous small vessel vasculitis, a comprehensive laboratory panel was performed. Warfarin induced vasculitis was suspected when withdrawal of warfarin, due to rising INR, led to improvement of the skin lesions. The diagnosis was finally confirmed when re-instatement of warfarin reproduced the skin lesions and a skin biopsy showed evidence for leukocytoclastic vasculitis with eosinophilic infiltration. A third of cases of leukocytoclastic vasculitis are due to drug hypersensitivity which being a diagnosis of exclusion with varying manifestations, requires a high index of clinical suspicion. Since drug induced leukocytoclastic vasculitis may affect multiple organ systems and even cause mortality, clinicians must be aware of this rare adverse event, promptly discontinue the drug, and commence anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive treatment when necessary.

Bilateral papillary muscle repositioning: successful repair of functional mitral regurgitation in dilative cardiomyopathy.  ;"OBJECTIVES: Functional mitral regurgitation (FMR) in patients with non-ischaemic dilative cardiomyopathy (DCM) is associated with heart failure and poor outcome. Aggressively undersized annuloplasty as an annular solution for a ventricular problem ameliorates heart failure but may be associated with recurrent FMR and does not improve survival. We sought to analyse if moderately undersized annuloplasty with repositioning of both papillary muscles can lead to improved valve stability and outcome in patients with DCM and FMR. METHODS: In 66 patients with DCM-associated FMR (age 66 ± 12 years, ejection fraction 29 ± 6% and mean pulmonary artery pressure 35 ± 11 mmHg) and severe leaflet tethering (tenting height ≥10 mm) bilateral papillary muscle repositioning was added to moderately undersized ring annuloplasty (median size 30 mm). Concomitant surgery included tricuspid valve repair in 86% of patients and atrial ablation in 44%. RESULTS: The early mortality rate was 9%. Overall 5-year freedom from all-cause death, left ventricular assist device implantation or heart transplant was 58% (95% confidence interval 45-71%). Six patients underwent reoperation (redo repair n = 4). Reverse remodelling was observed during follow-up in 66% of patients with decreasing left ventricular end-diastolic diameters (66 ± 5 to 61 ± 12 mm; P < 0.001) and left ventricular end-systolic diameters (56 ± 9 to 51 ± 14 mm; P = 0.001). Subgroup analyses (partial versus complete ring, preoperative left ventricular end-diastolic diameters <65 mm vs left ventricular end-diastolic diameter ≥65 mm) documented similar survival rates. A competing risks regression analysis identified cerebral vascular disease (P = 0.01), use of a partial ring (P = 0.03) and absence of tricuspid valve repair (P = 0.03) as independent predictors of death. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of bilateral papillary muscle repositioning and moderately undersized ring annuloplasty leads to stable mid-term repair results and reverse remodelling in patients with DCM and FMR and severe leaflet tethering.

Approach to An Unusual Cardiac Mass: Mitral Annulus Caseoma.  ;Caseous calcification of the mitral annulus (CCMA) is known to be a rare variant of mitral annulus calcification, a chronic and degenerative process of the mitral valve fibrous ring. It usually carries a benign prognosis. The following case demonstrates a huge mitral annulus caseoma that complicated with severe mitral regurgitation and was treated with a successful surgery. The common consensus on the optimal management of CCMA is conservative medical management and avoiding unnecessary surgery. Therewithal, the current indications for surgical intervention include mitral valve dysfunction, strokes and uncertain diagnosis. Aggressive debridement, risk of left ventricular perforation and exposure of caseous debris to the systemic blood flow may increase the risk of a standard mitral valve surgery. Mitral valve replacement should be preferred compared with mitral valve repair.

Left Main Coronary Artery Dissection Complicating Valve Replacement Surgery.  ;Iatrogenic left main coronary artery dissection is a rare entity for cardiac surgery but could cause severe low cardiac output and a catastrophic outcome. There is no conclusive strategy about how to manage such a condition. Here, we report a middle-aged woman who manifested with severe low cardiac output after aortic and mitral valve replacement surgery. She was subsequently diagnosed with extensive left main coronary artery dissection involving the left anterior descending artery and left circumflex artery, which resulted in large extension of myocardial infarction. The complex and dangerous vascular lesion was successfully treated by bailout stenting.

Coronary Injury in Mitral and Aortic Valve Surgery: A Case Series Using Optical Coherence Tomography.  ;Coronary occlusion is a rare but well-described complication of heart valve surgery. The left circumflex coronary artery, especially when it is dominant, is particularly at risk owing to the proximity of the mitral valve annulus. We report three cases of acute coronary complications of different valvular surgical procedures diagnosed and treated in the cardiac catheterization laboratory. Intracoronary optical coherence tomography was used to identify the cause of coronary flow impairment and provided important insights into the mechanism of intraoperative vascular damage.  
A multi-institutional experience in vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome diagnosis.  ;"OBJECTIVE: Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (vEDS) is a rare disorder and 1 of 13 types of EDS. The syndrome results in aortic and arterial aneurysms and dissections at a young age. Diagnosis is confirmed with molecular testing via skin biopsy or genetic testing for COL3A1 pathogenic variants. We describe a multi-institutional experience in the diagnosis of vEDS from 2000 to 2015. METHODS: This is a multi-institutional cross-sectional retrospective study of individuals with vEDS. The institutions were recruited through the Vascular Low Frequency Disease Consortium. Individuals were identified using the International Classification of Diseases-9 and 10-CM codes for EDS (756.83 and Q79.6). A review of records was then performed to select individuals with vEDS. Data abstraction included demographics, family history, clinical features, major and minor diagnostic criteria, and molecular testing results. Individuals were classified into two cohorts and then compared: those with pathogenic COL3A1 variants and those diagnosed by clinical criteria alone without molecular confirmation. RESULTS: Eleven institutions identified 173 individuals (35.3% male, 56.6% Caucasian) with vEDS. Of those, 11 (9.8%) had nonpathogenic alterations in COL3A1 and were excluded from the analysis. Among the remaining individuals, 86 (47.7% male, 68% Caucasian, 48.8% positive family history) had pathogenic COL3A1 variants and 76 (19.7% male, 19.7% Caucasian, 43.4% positive family history) were diagnosed by clinical criteria alone without molecular confirmation. Compared with the cohort with pathogenic COL3A1 variants, the clinical diagnosis only cohort had a higher number of females (80.3% vs 52.3%; P < .001), mitral valve prolapse (10.5% vs 1.2%; P = .009), and joint hypermobility (68.4% vs 40.7%; P < .001). Additionally, they had a lower frequency of easy bruising (23.7% vs 64%; P < .001), thin translucent skin (17.1% vs 48.8%; P < .001), intestinal perforation (3.9% vs 16.3%; P = .01), spontaneous pneumothorax/hemothorax (3.9% vs 14%, P.03), and arterial rupture (9.2% vs 17.4%; P = .13). There were no differences in mortality or age of mortality between the two cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the importance of confirming vEDS diagnosis by testing for pathogenic COL3A1 variants rather than relying on clinical diagnostic criteria alone given the high degree of overlap with other forms genetically triggered arteriopathies. Because not all COL3A1 variants are pathogenic, the interpretation of the genetic testing results by an individual trained in variant assessment is essential to confirm the diagnosis. An accurate diagnosis is critical and has serious implications for lifelong screening and treatment strategies for the affected individual and family members.  "
Changes in Right Ventricle Function After Mitral Valve Repair Surgery.  ;BACKGROUND: Right ventricular (RV) dysfunction can occur after cardiac surgery and persist for years. We assessed perioperative RV systolic function in patients undergoing mitral valve (MV) repair and further compared minimally invasive robotic-assisted mitral valve repair (MIMVr) vs standard 'open' MV repair (MVr). Speckle tracking (RV free wall strain [RVS]) was used as a sensitive echocardiography method to assess RV function. METHODS: Retrospective analysis, over 3 years, of consecutive patients (n = 158) referred to Mayo Clinic (Rochester, MN, USA). Preoperative, pre-discharge and 1 year transthoracic echocardiograms were reviewed. A prospective pilot study was performed for sample size estimation. Primary outcome was RV free wall strain (RVS). RESULTS: Right ventricular free wall strain declined after MV repair surgery (-22.6 ± 7% vs -15 ± 6%, p < 0.001). There were smaller reductions in RVS in MIMVr vs MVr group (-6.0 ± 9% vs -10.3 ± 8%, p < 0.01), which persisted after adjusting for baseline values (RVS treatment effect 1.5%, p = 0.007). There was greater recovery in MIMVr vs MVr group at 1 year follow-up vs pre-surgery values (-3.4 ± 9% vs -8.1 ± 8% respectively, p < 0.001, RVS treatment effect 1.7%, p = 0.001). Bypass time was higher in the MIMVr group (80min ± 22 vs 40min ± 20, p < 0.0001). The echo findings remained significant correcting for age, pulmonary pressures and change in ejection fraction. CONCLUSIONS: Right ventricular systolic dysfunction is common after MV repair surgery. Deterioration in RV contraction is less pronounced following MIMVr vs MVr and is associated with enhanced RV functional recovery at 1 year, albeit not to preoperative levels. This may potentially be associated with clinical functional improvement but further studies are warranted to investigate this.

Mid-regional proatrial natriuretic peptide for predicting prognosis in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  ;OBJECTIVES: N-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) predicts mortality and the development of heart failure in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Mid-regional proatrial natriuretic peptide (MR-proANP) is a stable by-product of production of atrial natriuretic peptide. We sought to compare the prognostic value of MR-proANP and NT-proBNP in HCM. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled a cohort of patients with HCM from different European centres and followed them. All patients had clinical, ECG and echocardiographic evaluation and measurement of MR-proANP and NT-proBNP at inclusion. RESULTS: Of 357 patients enrolled, the median age was 52 (IQR: 36-65) years. MR-proANP and NT-proBNP were both independently associated with age, weight, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), wall thickness and left atrial dimension. During a median follow-up of 23 months, 32 patients had a primary end point defined as death (n=6), heart transplantation (n=8), left ventricular assist device implantation (n=1) or heart failure hospitalisation (n=17). Both NT-proBNP and MR-proANP (p<10-4) were strongly associated with the primary endpoint, and the areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for both peptides were not significantly different. However, in a multiple stepwise regression analysis, the best model for predicting outcome was NYHA 1-2 vs 3-4 (HR=0.35, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.77, p<0.01), LVEF (HR=0.96, 95% CI 0.94 to 0.98, p=0.0005) and MR-proANP (HR=3.77, 95% CI 2.01 to 7.08, p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: MR-proANP emerges as a valuable biomarker for the prediction of death and heart failure related events in patients with HCM.

Catheter ablation of supraventricular tachycardia after tricuspid valve surgery in patients with congenital heart disease: A multicenter comparative study.  ;"BACKGROUND: Tricuspid valve (TV) surgery is often required for adult congenital heart disease (ACHD), but may hinder catheter ablation when an artificial material or imbricated tissue covers the tricuspid annulus. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the outcomes of catheter ablation after TV surgery in a large ACHD cohort. METHODS: An international retrospective study involving 7 centers was conducted. Patients who did and did not undergo TV surgery were matched for age, lesion classification, and postsurgical duration. TV operations were classified as valve ring/replacement vs repair. RESULTS: One hundred thirty-six patients (42 ring/replacement, 39 repair, and 55 no TV surgery; median 32 years [IQR 20 - 46]) underwent 180 procedures targeting 239 tachycardias (cavotricuspid-isthmus dependent intraatrial reentrant tachycardia 36%, other intraatrial reentrant tachycardia 29%, focal atrial tachycardia 18%, and other supraventricular tachyarrhythmia 17%). Post-TV surgery, procedures were longer (4.3 hours vs 3.3 hours; P = .003) and required longer fluoroscopy time (31 minutes vs 18 minutes; P = .001). At least partial acute success was achieved in 81% of procedures in the TV ring/replacement group vs 94% in both TV repair and no TV surgery groups (P = .03). The difference was driven mainly by ablation of annular substrates, with acute success in 73% of TV ring/replacement, 92% of TV repair, and 94% of no TV surgery groups (P = .01). Over a median of 3.0 years, tachycardia recurred after 26% of procedures. TV ring/replacement predicted recurrence in the multivariable analysis (hazard ratio 2.4; 95% confidence interval 1.2-5.2; P = .009). CONCLUSION: After surgery for ACHD, catheter ablation success was lower and tachycardia recurrence was higher after TV valve ring/replacement surgery. The findings of this retrospective report support future larger multicenter series and prospective evaluation to determine the role of empirical annular substrate ablation.  "

Aortic valve approaches in the era of minimally invasive cardiac surgery.  ;The concept of minimally invasive cardiac surgery has been gradually adopted world-wide since its inception more than 2 decades ago. Recently, catheter intervention has been used in the treatment of structural heart disease. Most notably, minimally invasive transcatheter aortic valve implantation is now an established treatment option for aortic valve stenosis. There are three major approaches for minimally invasive aortic valve surgery: via median sternotomy, via the parasternal approach, and via the thoracotomy approach. All these approaches allow for a small skin incision and/or avoid full sternotomy. Moreover, several advanced variations with additional aortic procedures or totally endoscopic management have been developed. When considering each approach, low invasiveness must be balanced with safety, as surgeons broaden their insight of advanced medicine. Physical invasiveness is largely related to the surgical approach in minimally invasive surgery. We review the history and evolution of the different surgical approaches for minimally invasive aortic valve replacement.

Early Aortic Paravalvular Leak After Conventional Cardiac Valve Surgery: A Single-Center Experience.  ;"BACKGROUND: Paravalvular leak (PVL) is a well-known complication after aortic valve replacement (AVR). Although some studies have described the incidence of postoperative aortic PVL, there are conflicting data about the predictive factors and a paucity of evidence regarding their time course and impact on survival. METHODS: Data were collected from patients who underwent surgical AVR at Circolo Hospital in Varese, Italy from January 2014 to December 2017. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was performed in all patients before hospital discharge. Additionally, a second TTE was obtained during postoperative follow-up in subjects with early aortic PVL. RESULTS: A total of 514 patients were enrolled in the study. At hospital discharge, aortic PVL was present in 60 patients (11.7%); the majority (78.3%) of the PVLs were mild. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified smaller body surface area, female sex, and operating surgeon as the strongest predictors of early aortic PVL. Follow-up TTE was available for 50 patients (83.3%). Median time from the date of surgery to follow-up TTE was 2.2 years (0.4 to 4 years). Most aortic PVLs remained unchanged (50%) or disappeared (36%) over time. Only 2 patients (4%) had a progression of the leak. Overall, mortality was 8.4% (43 of 514). Survival was negatively affected by the presence of residual, mild to moderate, or moderate aortic PVL. CONCLUSIONS: Aortic PVL is not uncommon after standard AVR. Operating surgeon, smaller body surface area, and female sex are risk factors for the development of this complication. These leaks are usually mild and generally have a benign course. However, the presence of mild to moderate or more severe aortic PVL may influence postoperative survival.  "

Reversible right heart failure after redo operation of a post-traumatic Gerbode defect.  ;INTRODUCTION: Gerbode defect is a rare entity and represents a small percent of all congenital defects. If left untreated, right heart failure may occur. CASE REPORT: We describe a redo case of a 47-year-old patient complaining about the signs and symptoms of decompensating right heart failure after a surgically treated post-traumatic Gerbode defect 8 years prior. DISCUSSION: Although it is described as a congenital defect, in clinical practice, results mostly as an iatrogenic complication after heart valve surgery, endocarditis, nodal ablation, or post-traumatic defect. Surgical correction is the treatment of choice independently of the provided cause. Dimensions, the position of the defect, are very important factors for the interventional approach. At 12 months post-operatively, the patient remained completely asymptomatic. He has an active life and presents all the echocardiographic metrics within normal values. CONCLUSION: We strongly recommend that in cardiac areas where high wall tension is applied, durable materials such as Dacron should be used. We also believe that a well-documented discussion with the patient, about his medical condition and his therapeutic alternatives, is imperative.

Symptoms, Hope, Self-Management Behaviors, and Quality of Life Among Chinese Preoperative Patient With Symptomatic Valvular Heart Diseases.  ;Introduction: More than 42 million people are estimated to suffer from valvular heart disease (VHD) worldwide with a prevalence of 5.3% to 7.7% in the Chinese adult population. The purpose of this study was to examine the associations between symptoms, hope, self-management behaviors, and quality of life (QOL) for preoperative patients with symptomatic VHD in a rural area of China. Method: This was a descriptive comparative study that took place in Nanning, China, between January 2015 and March 2016. The sample was 128 preoperative patients with symptomatic VHD. Data were collected using the Symptom Distress Questionnaire, Herth Hope Index, Self-Management Scale, and Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire. Results: Data from 122 patients were included in the final analysis. Mean scores of hope, self-management, and QOL were 36.71, 55.27, and 55.56. Worse total scores of symptom severity (r = 0.57 to 0.69, p < .001) and self-management behaviors (r = -0.22 to -0.25, p < .05) were associated with poorer QOL. Fatigue, loss of appetite, and self-management behaviors explained 49.90% variance of QOL (p < .001). Discussion: Fatigue, loss of appetite, and self-management influenced QOL of patients with symptomatic VHD. Interventions aimed at strengthening self-management and relieving symptoms should be tailored for patients with symptomatic VHD base on their traditional animist belief and food culture in rural areas of China such as the Zhuang Autonomous Region.  
Interscallop indentation closure as an adjunctive technique in mitral valve repair for degenerative mitral valve disease.  ;BACKGROUND: Interscallop indentation closure is a useful adjunctive technique which presents several different effects in repairing degenerative mitral regurgitation. However, there are some concerns that it might reduce mitral valve area by restricting the posterior leaflet mobility. We aim to assess postoperative echocardiographic findings after mitral valve repair using this technique. METHODS: Between January 2009 and December 2015, 897 patients underwent mitral valve repair for degenerative mitral regurgitation at our institutions. We reviewed 98 patients in which we used indentation closure technique, and we analyzed operative and echocardiographic data. RESULTS: Ring annuloplasty and concomitant repair techniques such as leaflet resection and neochordal placement were used in all patients. Specific purposes of indentation closure included gap closure (n = 57), prolapse repair (n = 11), leaflet redundancy repair (n = 16), and leaflet deficiency repair (n = 12). Eleven patients had double indentation closure. Postoperative pre-discharge echocardiography showed no moderate or greater residual mitral regurgitation, mean transmitral pressure gradient of 3.4 ± 1.4 mmHg, and mitral valve area of 2.7 ± 0.7 cm2. Follow-up echocardiography performed at 43.7 ± 23.9 months after surgery showed six cases (6.4%) with recurrent moderate or greater mitral regurgitation, mean transmitral pressure gradient of 3.3 ± 1.3 mmHg, and mitral valve area of 2.5 ± 0.6 cm2. CONCLUSIONS: Interscallop indentation closure is a simple and effective adjunctive technique which can be used for several different purposes. It achieves excellent control of mitral regurgitation with preserved mitral valve area when it is used in addition to standard mitral valve repair techniques in selected cases.  
Planned vaginal delivery and cardiovascular morbidity in pregnant women with heart disease.  ;BACKGROUND: Although consensus guidelines on the management of cardiovascular disease in pregnancy reserve cesarean delivery for obstetric indications, there is a paucity of data to support this approach. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to compare cardiovascular and obstetric morbidity in women with cardiovascular disease according to the plan for vaginal birth or cesarean delivery. STUDY DESIGN: We assembled a prospective cohort of women delivering at an academic tertiary care center with a protocolized multidisciplinary approach to management of cardiovascular disease between September 2011 and December 2016. Our practice is to encourage vaginal birth in women with cardiovascular disease unless there is an obstetric indication for cesarean delivery. We allow women attempting vaginal birth a trial of Valsalva in the second stage with the ability to provide operative vaginal delivery if pushing leads to changes in hemodynamics or symptoms. Women were classified according to planned mode of delivery: either vaginal birth or cesarean delivery. We then used univariate analysis to compare adverse outcomes according to planned mode of delivery. The primary composite cardiac outcome of interest included sustained arrhythmia, heart failure, cardiac arrest, cerebral vascular accident, need for cardiac surgery or intervention, or death. Secondary obstetric and neonatal outcomes were also considered. RESULTS: We included 276 consenting women with congenital heart disease (68.5%), arrhythmias (11.2%), connective tissue disease (9.1%), cardiomyopathy (8.0%), valvular disease (1.4%), or vascular heart disease (1.8%) at or beyond 24 weeks' gestation. Seventy-six percent (n = 210) planned vaginal birth and 24% (n = 66) planned cesarean delivery. Women planning vaginal birth had lower rates of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, multiparity, and preterm delivery. All women attempting vaginal birth were allowed Valsalva. Among planned vaginal deliveries 86.2% (n = 181) were successful, with a 9.5% operative vaginal delivery rate. Five women underwent operative vaginal delivery for the indication of cardiovascular disease without another obstetric indication at the discretion of the delivering provider. Four of these patients tolerated trials of Valsalva ranging from 15 to 75 minutes prior to delivery. Adverse cardiac outcomes were similar between planned vaginal birth and cesarean delivery groups (4.3% vs 3.0%, P = 1.00). Rates of postpartum hemorrhage (1.9% vs 10.6%, P < .01) and transfusion (1.9% vs 9.1%, P = .01) were lower in the planned vaginal birth group. There were no differences in adverse cardiac, obstetric, or neonatal outcomes in the cohort overall or the subset of women with high-risk cardiovascular disease or a high burden of obstetric comorbidity. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that cesarean delivery does not reduce adverse cardiovascular outcomes and lend support to a planned vaginal birth for the majority of women with cardiovascular disease including those with high-risk disease.  
Commissuroplasty as a Main Operative Technique in Rheumatic Mitral Valve Repair: Surgical Experiences and Mid-Term Results.  ;"AIM: We aimed to evaluate the therapeutic effectiveness of commissuroplasty in mitral valve repair for rheumatic mitral valve disease. For this purpose, we summarise our experience with this technique and analyse the mid-term postoperative outcomes. METHOD: We retrospectively evaluated the records of patients with rheumatic valve disease who underwent mitral valve repair between January 2011 and January 2018 at our centre. Detailed follow-up data were collected. A Kaplan-Meier survival curve for survival free from reoperation and valve failure was constructed. Multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of relevant end points (death, reoperation, and valve failure). RESULTS: A total of 362 patients underwent rheumatic mitral valve repair during the study period. Mitral valve stenosis was the primary pathological feature. Almost all surgeries were accomplished via commissuroplasty. The mean duration of follow-up was 25.57 ± 19.91 months. Twenty-two (22) endpoint events were noted during follow-up. The 2- and 7-year rates of survival free from reoperation and valve failure were 93.9%±1.4% and 91.5%±2.0%, respectively. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that left atrial anteroposterior diameter >60 mm (hazard ratio, 5.2; p < 0.001) was an independent predictor of all endpoints. CONCLUSIONS: Most Chinese patients with rheumatic valve disease were treated effectively via commissuroplasty combined with other surgical procedures, and the mid-term postoperative outcomes were satisfactory.

Right ventricular outflow tract reconstruction with the Labcor® stentless valved pulmonary conduit.  ;"OBJECTIVES: The right ventricular outflow tract reconstruction is a common necessity in congenital cardiac surgery. As homograft availability is limited, alternatives need to be evaluated. The Labcor® conduit consists of a porcine tricomposite valve assembled inside a bovine pericardium tube. This study presents intermediate-term results for its utilization for right ventricular outflow tract reconstruction. METHODS: Labcor conduits were implanted in 53 patients (February 2009-July 2016). We analysed perioperative data, freedom from conduit failure and risk factors for conduit dysfunction. RESULTS: The most common diagnosis was Tetralogy of Fallot (n = 20, 37.7%). The median age at surgery was 10.0 [interquartile range (IQR) 4.9-14.3] years. Pulmonary artery plasty (n = 37, 69.8%) and augmentation of the right ventricular outflow tract (n = 16, 30.2%) were often part of the procedure. The median conduit size was 21 (range 11-25) mm. There was no in-hospital death. The median follow-up after surgery was 4.6 (IQR 3.4-5.6) years. Fourteen patients (27.5%) developed conduit failure with stenosis being the main cause. Freedom from conduit failure was 98.0% at 2 and 80.5% at 5 years. The median longevity of the conduit was 7.4 years (95% confidence interval 5.1-9.8 years). Younger age and smaller conduit size were related to conduit failure. CONCLUSIONS: Utilization of the Labcor conduit revealed acceptable intermediate-term results. The conduit appeared to be functioning sufficiently well within the first 5 years in the majority of patients. The higher rate of failure concerning smaller conduits might be associated with somatic outgrowth; however, conduit degeneration as common and long-term outcome still needs to be evaluated.  "

Prolonged pulmonary pulse transit time is associated with symptoms in patients with significant mitral stenosis and sinus rhythm.  ;"INTRODUCTION: Pulmonary pulse transit time (pPTT) is a novel noninvasive echocardiographic measure to assess pulmonary arterial hemodynamics. It has been shown to be shorter in precapillary pulmonary hypertension (PHT). Mitral stenosis (MS) is one of the causes of postcapillary PHT. We aimed to investigate pPTT in patients with MS and its relationship with symptoms. METHODS: We included 51 patients with MS (25 were asymptomatic, NYHA I, and 26 were symptomatic, NHYA II or III), and 50 controls, and evaluated their demographic characteristics and echocardiographic variables, including pPTT. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics, including age, sex, body mass index, and cardiovascular risk factors, were similar between the MS and the control group. The pPTT was longer in the MS group than in the control group (0.21 ± 0.08 vs 0.15 ± 0.05, P < .001). Patients with symptomatic MS had longer pPTT than asymptomatic patients (P = .005). The pPTT was positively correlated with left atrial volume index and systolic pulmonary artery pressure, and negatively with tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (r = .432; P < .001, r = .319; P = .001, r = -.293; and P = .003, respectively). CONCLUSION: The measurement of pPTT appears clinically relevant in patients with PHT. Further studies evaluating whether it is useful in distinguishing precapillary from postcapillary PHT are required.  "

Clinical application of stress echocardiography for valvular heart disease.  ;Stress echocardiography is widely used to assess several cardiovascular diseases, including ischemic heart disease, valvular heart disease (VHD), heart failure, congenital heart disease, and pulmonary hypertension. In valvular heart disease with asymptomatic severe or symptomatic non-severe status, stress echocardiography plays a central role in the management. As of 2017, the updated American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association and European Society of Cardiology/European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery VHD guidelines recommended stress testing to (1) confirm symptoms and (2) evaluate the hemodynamic response to exercise. In patients with undetermined VHD severity in the presence of low-flow status, it can also be helpful to determine whether the VHD is severe based on flow-dependent changes in response to stress. The clinical indications of stress echocardiography in VHD have expanded with growing evidence for prognosis and being an early marker for interventions. As a result, demand has increased in major cardiology societies for the standardization of stress echocardiography in VHD. Echocardiographic centers should be aware of the clinical potential of stress echocardiography to ensure its optimal application and performance in VHD. This article reviews the clinical application of stress echocardiography, including dobutamine, semisupine bicycle, treadmill, and leg-positive pressure for VHD patient management, and focuses on the current consensus regarding the use of stress echocardiography in VHD. Stress echocardiography is safe and should be encouraged, especially in heart valve clinics, to understand the complex mechanism in asymptomatic patients.

Transcatheter and Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement in Patients With Recent Acute Heart Failure.  ;"BACKGROUND: Patients with severe aortic stenosis and heart failure have poor prognosis, and their outcomes may be suboptimal even after transcatheter (TAVR) and surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). METHODS: This is an analysis of the nationwide FinnValve registry, which included patients who underwent primary TAVR or SAVR with a bioprothesis for aortic stenosis. We evaluated the outcome of patients with acute heart failure (AHF) within 60 days prior to TAVR or SAVR. RESULTS: The prevalence of recent AHF was 11.4% (484 of 4241 patients) in the SAVR cohort and 11.3% (210 of 1855 patients) in the TAVR cohort. In the SAVR cohort, AHF was associated with lower 30-day survival (91.3% vs 97.0%; adjusted odds ratio 1.801, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.125-2.882) and 5-year survival (64.0% vs 81.2%; adjusted hazard ratio 1.482, 95% CI 1.207-1.821). SAVR patients with AHF had higher risk of major bleeding, need of mechanical circulatory support, acute kidney injury, prolonged hospital stay, and composite end-point (30-day mortality, stroke and/or acute kidney injury). Patients with AHF had a trend toward lower 30-day survival (crude rates 95.2% vs 97.9%; adjusted odds ratio 2.028, 95% CI 0.908-4.529) as well as significantly lower 5-year survival (crude rates 45.3% vs 58.5%; adjusted hazard ratio 1.530, 95% CI 1.185-1.976) also after TAVR. AHF increased the risk of acute kidney injury, prolonged hospital stay, and composite end-point after TAVR. CONCLUSIONS: Recent AHF is associated with increased risk of mortality and morbidity after SAVR and TAVR. These findings suggest that aortic stenosis patients should be referred for invasive treatment before the development of clinically evident heart failure.  "
Transcatheter aortic valve deployment influences neo-sinus thrombosis risk: An in vitro flow study.  ;OBJECTIVES: We investigated the impact of (transcatheter heart valve) THV expansion at the level of the native annulus and implant depth on valve performance and neo-sinus flow stasis. BACKGROUND: Flow stasis in the neo-sinus is one of the identified risk factors of THV thrombosis. METHODS: A 29 mm CoreValve and 26 mm SAPIEN 3 were deployed under different expansions (CoreValve, SAPIEN 3) and implant depths (CoreValve) within a patient-derived aortic root in a pulse duplicator. Fluorescent dye was injected during diastole into the neo-sinus and imaged over 20 cardiac cycles. Washout times were computed as a measure of flow stasis for each deployment. RESULTS: The 10% CoreValve under-expansion improved neo-sinus washout over full expansion by 8% (p < .001), and higher CoreValve implant depth improved neo-sinus washout (p < .001). The 10% SAPIEN 3 under-expansion improved neo-sinus washout by 23% (p < .001). Under-expansion of both valve types caused higher pressure gradients and smaller effective orifice areas than full expansion. CONCLUSIONS: Neo-sinus flow stasis is influenced by THV expansion and implant depth (CoreValve). The 10% valve under-deployment (oversizing) may facilitate reduced flow stasis in the neo-sinus with minimal increase in pressure gradients. This strategy may be helpful for patient anatomies, which are in-between transcatheter valve sizes.  
Impact of stroke volume on severe aortic stenosis in patients with normal left ventricular function.  ;BACKGROUND: Low-flow (LF) aortic stenosis (AS) with a normal ejection fraction reportedly has a worse prognosis than normal-flow (NF) AS. We assessed whether the stroke volume affects early- and long-term survival of patients with AS undergoing aortic valve replacement. METHODS AND RESULTS: From 2007 to 2016, 179 patients with AS and a normal ejection fraction (≥ 50%) and without other valve diseases were divided into two groups according to the stroke volume index (SVI): NF group (SVI ≥ 35 ml/m2, n = 167) and LF group (SVI < 35 ml/m2, n = 12). Early- and long-term survival was compared between the two groups. Preoperative echocardiography showed that the end-diastolic diameter and aortic valve area were smaller in the LF than NF group (43 ± 1.9 vs. 48 ± 0.4 mm, p < 0.005 and 0.33 ± 0.14 vs. 0.49 ± 0.14 cm2/m2, p < 0.0005, respectively). Hospital mortality was significantly higher (16.7% vs. 1.8%, p < 0.05) and 5-year overall survival was lower (58 ± 17 vs. 84 ± 4.2 months, p < 0.005) in the LF than NF group. CONCLUSION: Patients with LF AS had worse operative and long-term outcomes than those with NF, even though they had preserved LV function.  
Fetal tricuspid regurgitation in second trimester of pregnancies at risk for fetal chromosomal defects.  ;PURPOSE: To determine the prevalence and screening performance for detection of Down syndrome of fetal tricuspid regurgitation in the second trimester of pregnancies at risk for fetal chromosomal defects. METHODS: A prospective study was carried out on pregnant women at risk for fetal chromosomal defects who had amniocentesis or cordocentesis for fetal karyotyping at 16 to 23 weeks' gestation, between February 2017 and January 2018. An assessment of the fetal tricuspid valve was conducted before any invasive procedure. Tricuspid regurgitation was defined as flow reversal for at least half of systole, with a maximum velocity of ≥100 cm/s. RESULTS: In the 486 cases studies, fetal tricuspid regurgitation was found in 21 (4.3%), and 10 fetuses had Down syndrome. The tricuspid regurgitation was found in 15 (3.2%) of the 462 euploid fetuses, in 5 (50%) of the Down syndrome fetuses, and in 1 (7.1%) of the fetuses with other chromosome abnormalities. Tricuspid regurgitation was found as an isolated marker in 2 of the 10 Down syndrome fetuses. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value to screen for Down syndrome were 50%, 96.8%, 25%, and 98.9%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Tricuspid regurgitation showed a high prevalence in fetal Down syndrome at the gestational age of 16 to 23 weeks and was an isolated marker in 20% of them.  
Prosthesis selection for aortic valve replacement in patients on hemodialysis.  ;OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of prosthesis selection in hemodialysis patients undergoing valve replacement for aortic valve stenosis. METHODS: From July 2008 to December 2016, 76 patients on hemodialysis underwent aortic valve replacement for aortic valve stenosis. Of these patients, 30 patients were treated by a mechanical valve and 46 patients were treated by a bioprosthesis. Early outcomes and long-term outcomes were compared. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients treated by a mechanical valve was younger than the patients treated by a bioprosthesis (p < 0.001). There were no significant differences in in-hospital mortality (p = 0.52). For the long-term outcomes, complications associated with bleeding were higher in patients who received a mechanical valve (p = 0.032). However, no significant difference was observed in mortality (p = 0.65) and major adverse cardiovascular cerebrovascular event (MACCE: p = 0.59). The actuarial survival rate with a mechanical valve was 56.7% (95% CI 36.4-72.8%) at 3 years and 48.6% (95% CI 28.9-65.8%) at 5 years. The actuarial survival rate with a bioprosthesis was 61.2% (95% CI 44.0-74.5%) at 3 years and 39.5% (95% CI 20.9-57.8%) at 5 years. No patients from both groups needed redo surgery for valvular deterioration. Further, there was no significant difference in long-term mortality (p = 0.91) and MACCE (p = 0.63) in a propensity score-matched patient comparison. CONCLUSIONS: Although bleeding complications were higher in patients who received a mechanical valve, there were no significant differences in early- and long-term mortality, and MACCE between patients treated by a mechanical valve and a bioprosthesis.  
"Right Transaxillary Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Using the ""Flip-n-Flex"" Technique.  ";"BACKGROUND: Right transaxillary transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAx-TAVR) is rarely performed due to challenging vascular tortuosity and unfavorable implantation angles. We explored this procedure using the newer-generation balloon-expandable SAPIEN 3 (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA) valve and our novel ""flip-n-flex"" technique. The safety and effectiveness of the procedure and the learning curve of our early experiences were investigated. METHODS: The first 10 consecutive patients undergoing right TAx-TAVR performed at our center from June 2016 to May 2018 were included in the study. Patients' preoperative characteristics, procedural outcomes, and clinical outcomes were studied. Intraoperative fluoroscopy times were also reviewed to analyze the procedural learning curve. RESULTS: The 10 patients were a mean age of 81.8 ± 8.7 years, and 5 patients (50%) were women. Mean Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk of Mortality was 12.0% ± 9.5%. Procedural success was achieved in all cases without vascular complications. Paravalvular leak was absent or mild in all patients. Two patients (20%) required permanent pacemaker implantation. The median postoperative length of stay was 4 days (range, 2-13 days). The 30-day mortality was 0%. Mean transvalvular gradient improved from 38.4 ± 12.6 mm Hg to 9 ± 4.4 mm Hg postoperatively. New York Heart Association Functional Classification improved in all patients. The fluoroscopy time showed marked reduction from 44.1 ± 8.2 minutes to 17.4 ± 2.9 minutes with the use of the flip-n-flex technique. CONCLUSIONS: Our early experience of right TAx-TAVR with the SAPIEN 3 valve demonstrated satisfactory outcomes and a quick learning as facilitated by the flip-n-flex technique. This could be a beneficial TAVR approach to suitable patients.  "
Comparative Outcomes of Transcarotid and Transsubclavian Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.  ;"BACKGROUND: Previous reports described successful use of transcarotid and transsubclavian approaches for the performance of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in patients with severe aortic stenosis who cannot be treated with transfemoral access. The purpose of the present study was to compare these two alternative approaches with respect to safety, efficacy, and procedural efficiency. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of all TAVR procedures performed through either a transcarotid or a transsubclavian approach at a single tertiary care medical center between January 2016 and October 2018 was performed. Outcomes are reported in accordance with the Valve Academic Research Consortium definitions. RESULTS: During the study period, 33 patients had transcarotid TAVR and 38 patients had transsubclavian TAVR. Transcarotid patients were older (mean age, 82.9 ± 7.2 vs 78.1 ± 8.2 years; P = .012), but otherwise the two groups were not significantly different with respect to preoperative characteristics. Valve deployment was similar between the groups (100% vs 97%; P = .348). Procedure time was shorter with the transcarotid approach (110 ± 32 vs 134 ± 45 minutes; P = .014). There was a lower mean fluoroscopy air kerma in the transcarotid group (682.82 ± 713.48 mGy vs 2141 ± 2055 mGy; P < .001), although fluoroscopy dose-area product did not differ between the groups. There was no difference between the groups with respect to in-hospital or 30-day mortality (0% vs 3%; P = .355), stroke (3% vs 8%; P = .393), or vascular complication (3% vs 4%; P = .840). CONCLUSIONS: The transcarotid and the transsubclavian approaches have similar safety and efficacy outcomes. The transcarotid approach had a shorter procedure duration and a trend toward lower fluoroscopy duration and radiation exposure.  "

Mechanical circulatory support with the Impella 5.0 and the Impella Left Direct pumps for postcardiotomy cardiogenic shock at La Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital.  ;OBJECTIVES: Postcardiotomy cardiogenic shock (PCCS) is associated with high mortality rates of 50-80%. Although veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation has been used as mechanical circulatory support in patients with PCCS, it is associated with a high rate of complications and poor quality of life. The Impella 5.0 and Impella Left Direct (LD) (Impella 5.0/LD) are minimally invasive left ventricular assist devices that provide effective haemodynamic support resulting in left ventricular unloading and systemic perfusion. Our goal was to describe the outcome of patients with PCCS supported with the Impella 5.0/LD at La Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed consecutive patients supported with the Impella 5.0/LD for PCCS between December 2010 and June 2015. Survival outcome and in-hospital complications were assessed. RESULTS: A total of 29 patients (63 ± 14 years, 17% women) with PCCS were supported with the Impella 5.0/LD. At baseline, 69% experienced chronic heart failure, 66% had dilated cardiomyopathy and 57% had valvular disease. The mean EuroSCORE II was 22 ± 17 and the ejection fraction was 28 ± 11%. Most of the patients underwent isolated valve surgery (45%) or isolated coronary artery bypass grafting (38%). The mean duration of Impella support was 9 ± 7 days. Weaning from the Impella was successful in 72.4%, and 58.6% survived to discharge. Recovery of native heart function was observed in 100% of discharged patients. Survival to 30 days and to 1 year from Impella implant was 58.6% and 51.7%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The Impella 5.0 and the Impella LD represent an excellent treatment option for critically ill patients with PCCS and are associated with favourable survival outcome and native heart recovery.

Clinical assessment of aortic valve stenosis: Comparison between 4D flow MRI and transthoracic echocardiography.  ;"BACKGROUND: The prevalence of valvular aortic stenosis (AS) increases as the population ages. Echocardiographic measurements of peak jet velocity (Vpeak ), mean pressure gradient (Pmean ), and aortic valve area (AVA) determine AS severity and play a pivotal role in the stratification towards valvular replacement. A multimodality imaging approach might be needed in cases of uncertainty about the actual severity of the stenosis. PURPOSE: To compare four-dimensional phase-contrast magnetic resonance (4D PC-MR), two-dimensional (2D) PC-MR, and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) for quantification of AS. STUDY TYPE: Prospective. POPULATION: Twenty patients with various degrees of AS (69.3 ± 5.0 years). FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCES: 4D PC-MR and 2D PC-MR at 3T. ASSESSMENT: We compared Vpeak , Pmean , and AVA between TTE, 4D PC-MR, and 2D PC-MR. Flow eccentricity was quantified by means of normalized flow displacement, and its influence on the accuracy of TTE measurements was investigated. STATISTICAL TESTS: Pearson's correlation, Bland-Altman analysis, paired t-test, and intraclass correlation coefficient. RESULTS: 4D PC-MR measured higher Vpeak (r = 0.95, mean difference + 16.4 ± 10.7%, P <0.001), and Pmean (r = 0.92, mean difference + 14.9 ± 16.0%, P = 0.013), but a less critical AVA (r = 0.80, mean difference + 19.9 ± 20.6%, P = 0.002) than TTE. In contrast, unidirectional 2D PC-MR substantially underestimated AS severity when compared with TTE. Differences in Vpeak between 4D PC-MR and TTE showed to be strongly correlated with the eccentricity of the flow jet (r = 0.89, P <0.001). Use of 4D PC-MR improved the concordance between Vpeak and AVA (from 0.68 to 0.87), and between PGmean and AVA (from 0.68 to 0.86). DATA CONCLUSION: 4D PC-MR improves the concordance between the different AS parameters and could serve as an additional imaging technique next to TTE. Future studies should address the potential value of 4D PC-MR in patients with discordant echocardiographic parameters. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 2 Technical Efficacy: Stage 2 J. Magn. Reson.

Global regurgitant volume: approaching the critical mass in valvular-driven heart failure.  ;"AIMS: Recent progress in the diagnosis of functional valve regurgitation forms a coherent perception of severity thresholds by quantitative assessment. However, thresholds focused on either valve in isolation-not accounting for the global haemodynamic burden arising from concomitant functional regurgitation of the mitral and tricuspid valves. We sought to determine whether the global regurgitant volume is associated with adverse cardiac remodelling and mortality. METHODS AND RESULTS: This long-term observational study included 414 patients on guideline-directed medical therapy. Baseline global regurgitant load defined as the sum of mitral and tricuspid regurgitant volume was assessed by the proximal flow convergence method. All-cause mortality during 5 years follow-up served as the primary endpoint. The median global regurgitant load was 30 mL (interquartile range 15-49) with 67% accounting for mitral and 33% accounting for tricuspid regurgitant volume. The global regurgitant load had significant impact on outcome with a crude hazard ratio of 1.46 (1.28-1.66; P < 0.001) for a 1-SD increase in global regurgitant volume, results that remained virtually unchanged after bootstrap or clinical confounder-based adjustment (P < 0.001 for adjusted models). Spline curve analysis showed a linearly increasing risk with a threshold of 50 mL and sustained increasing risk thereafter. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates the detrimental effect of the global regurgitant load in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. The threshold where heart failure is driven by the valve lesions is a global regurgitant volume of 50 mL with continuously increasing risk beyond that threshold. Future studies need to address whether an attempt to reduce the global regurgitant volume can improve outcome.  "

Pulmonary artery growth after Modified Blalock-Taussig shunt: A single center experience.  ;"OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates growth of pulmonary artery (PA) between different age groups after Modified Blalock-Taussig shunt (MBTS) based on a single center experience. METHODS: We retrospective analyzed outcomes of 90 patients undergoing MBTS in our institute from January 1, 2010 to May 1, 2018. Patients were divided into three groups: Group 1, ≦2 months, Group 2, >2 months, ≦24 wmonths, Group 3, >24 months. The outcome included PA growth, overall survival rates and postoperative complications. RESULTS: 23 patients were involved in Group 1, while 49 in Group 2 and 18 in Group 3. The diameter of the PA, McGoon ratio, Nakata index and the oxygen saturation increased significantly after MBTS. Compared to pre-MBTS, there was no statistically significant increase of McGoon ratio in Group 3 after performing MBTS, but it witnessed less secondary cardiac surgery rate compared with Group 2 (11.11% vs. 48.98%, P = 0.005). Cumulative survival rates of three groups were 60.53%, 85.70%, 94.40% at 1 year; 60.53%, 78.30%, 87.75% at 3 years and 60.53%, 78.30%, 87.75% at 5 years. Multivariable analysis showed diastolic blood pressure <30 mmHg [OR 14.14 (1.92-104.32), P = 0.009], cardiopulmonary bypass use [OR 16.79 (2.05-137.67), P = 0.009] and single ventricle anomaly [OR 8.80 (1.18-65.54), P = 0.034] were predictors of perioperative mortality. CONCLUSION: MBTS in our institute is a conventional and effective procedure for growth of PA especially for patients younger than 24 months. Patients with biventricular anomaly, no cardiopulmonary bypass use in surgery and relatively high postoperative diastolic blood pressure will likely offer a good prognosis.  "
A mechanistic investigation of the EDWARDS INTUITY Elite valve's hemodynamic performance.  ;OBJECTIVE: Rapid deployment surgical aortic valve replacement has emerged as an alternative to the contemporary sutured valve technique. A difference in transvalvular pressure has been observed clinically between RD-SAVR and contemporary SAVR. A mechanistic inquiry into the impact of the rapid deployment valve inflow frame design on the left ventricular outflow tract and valve hemodynamics is needed. METHODS: A 23 mm EDWARDS INTUITY Elite rapid deployment valve and a control contemporary, sutured valve, a 23 mm Magna Ease valve, were implanted in an explanted human heart by an experienced cardiac surgeon. Per convention, the rapid deployment valve was implanted with three non-pledgeted, simple guiding sutures, while fifteen pledgeted, mattress sutures were used to implant the contemporary surgical valve. In vitro flow models were created from micro-computed tomography scans of the implanted valves and surrounding cardiac anatomy. Particle image velocimetry and hydrodynamic characterization experiments were conducted in the vicinity of the valves in a validated pulsatile flow loop system. RESULTS: The rapid deployment and control valves were found to have mean transvalvular pressure gradients of 7.92 ± 0.37 and 10.13 ± 0.48 mmHg, respectively. The inflow frame of the rapid deployment valve formed a larger, more circular, left ventricular outflow tract compared to the control valve. Furthermore, it was found that the presence of the control valve's sub-annular pledgets compromised its velocity distribution and consequently its pressure gradient. CONCLUSIONS: The rapid deployment valve's intra-annular inflow frame provides for a larger, left ventricular outflow tract, thus reducing the transvalvular pressure gradient and improving overall hemodynamic performance.  
Elevated lymphatic vessel density measured by Lyve-1 expression in areas of replacement fibrosis in the ventricular septum of patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM).  ;Lymphatic microvessel density (LMVD) contributes to fibrosis in patients with myocardial infarction. However, the role of LMVD in the process of myocardial fibrosis in hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) patients is unclear. We studied LMVD in ventricular septal (VS) samples from 52 individuals (42 was HOCM patients who underwent a transaortic extended septal myectomy, and 10 traffic accident victims), and examined the relationships between the LMVD stained immunohistochemically with lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor (LYVE-1) antibodies, collagen volume fraction (CVF), and clinical characteristics. Compared with traffic accident victims, LMVD was significantly increased in VS of HOCM patients (132.0 ± 49.0 VS 57.8 ± 48.8/mm2, p = 0.000). HOCM patients with syncope had higher level of LMVD than without syncope [166.7 (131.0-201.1) VS 116.4 (80.7-152.1)/mm2, p = 0.017], and LMVD were positively correlated with Log (CVF) (r = 0.431, p = 0.004). On multiple variables regression analysis, LMVD was independently associated with Log (CVF) (r = 0.379, p = 0.009) and syncope (r = 0.335, p = 0.020). In conclusions, the LYVE-1-positive lymphatics have close associations with VS fibrosis in HOCM patients.  
Identification of a Multiplex Biomarker Panel for Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Using Quantitative Proteomics and Machine Learning.  ;Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is defined by pathological left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). It is the commonest inherited cardiac condition and a significant number of high risk cases still go undetected until a sudden cardiac death (SCD) event. Plasma biomarkers do not currently feature in the assessment of HCM disease progression, which is tracked by serial imaging, or in SCD risk stratification, which is based on imaging parameters and patient/family history. There is a need for new HCM plasma biomarkers to refine disease monitoring and improve patient risk stratification. To identify new plasma biomarkers for patients with HCM, we performed exploratory myocardial and plasma proteomics screens and subsequently developed a multiplexed targeted liquid chromatography-tandem/mass spectrometry-based assay to validate the 26 peptide biomarkers that were identified. The association of discovered biomarkers with clinical phenotypes was prospectively tested in plasma from 110 HCM patients with LVH (LVH+ HCM), 97 controls, and 16 HCM sarcomere gene mutation carriers before the development of LVH (subclinical HCM). Six peptides (aldolase fructose-bisphosphate A, complement C3, glutathione S-transferase omega 1, Ras suppressor protein 1, talin 1, and thrombospondin 1) were increased significantly in the plasma of LVH+ HCM compared with controls and correlated with imaging markers of phenotype severity: LV wall thickness, mass, and percentage myocardial scar on cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging. Using supervised machine learning (ML), this six-biomarker panel differentiated between LVH+ HCM and controls, with an area under the curve of ≥ 0.87. Five of these peptides were also significantly increased in subclinical HCM compared with controls. In LVH+ HCM, the six-marker panel correlated with the presence of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia and the estimated five-year risk of sudden cardiac death. Using quantitative proteomic approaches, we have discovered six potentially useful circulating plasma biomarkers related to myocardial substrate changes in HCM, which correlate with the estimated sudden cardiac death risk.

Gender-related differences in patients undergoing transcatheter mitral valve interventions in clinical practice: 1-year results from the German TRAMI registry.  ;"OBJECTIVES: Information on gender-related differences in terms of baseline characteristics and clinical outcome of patients undergoing MitraClip® implantation in daily clinical practice have been studied in smaller populations previously. This study sought to additionally evaluate gender-related differences in a larger German real-world patient population. METHODS AND RESULTS: We analyzed data from the prospective and multicenter German TRAMI Registry. Between 08/2010 and 07/2013 327 women and 501 men underwent MitraClip® implantation for significant mitral valve regurgitation. Female patients were significantly older and showed higher rates of frailty compared to men. In contrast, men had significantly higher rates of comorbidities compared to women. The majority of patients underwent MitraClip® implantation for secondary mitral regurgitation, with no significant gender-related differences. MitraClip® treatment was equally effective in terms of procedural results and residual mitral regurgitation in women and men and complication rates were low. However, in this real-world analysis severe bleeding complications were significantly higher in women (p = .02) and re-intervention rates were significantly higher in men after MitraClip® treatment (p = .02). Women showed less improvement in functional NYHA class after MitraClip® treatment compared to men at 1-year follow-up (FU; p < .001). No significant differences between female and male patients were found in 1-year mortality and in re-hospitalization rates. CONCLUSION: In this analysis from a large prospective, multicenter real-world registry MitraClip® implantation is safe and effective for treatment of significant mitral regurgitation with equal postprocedural results and mortality rates during 1-year follow-up. Men and women showed a persisting and significant clinical benefit at 1-year FU after treatment. Complication and re-intervention rates were low. Additional studies are needed to further evaluate our findings on increased bleeding complications and decreased functional improvement in women at 1-year follow-up after MitraClip® therapy.  "
Perioperative changes of the slope in the preload recruitable stroke work relationship by a single-beat technique after mitral valve surgery in functional mitral regurgitation with non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy.  ;"OBJECTIVES: The slope in the preload recruitable stroke work relationship is a highly linear, load-insensitive contractile parameter. However, the perioperative change of the slope has not been reported before. We examined the perioperative slope from a steady-state single beat in patients with functional mitral regurgitation and assessed the correlation with brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels. METHODS: The study included 16 patients with non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy and refractory heart failure: 10 patients underwent mitral valve plasty and left ventricular plasty (MVP + LVP group) and 6 patients who underwent mitral valve replacement and papillary muscle tugging approximation (MVR + PMTA group). The left ventricular ejection fraction was assessed by the modified Simpson method; the slope was assessed by the single-beat technique using transthoracic echocardiography. BNP levels were measured by chemiluminescent immunoassay. RESULTS: The left ventricular ejection fraction and slope did not significantly change from pre- to early post-surgery in the MVP + LVP group. Both the left ventricular ejection fraction and slope significantly increased 6 months after surgery in the MVR + PMTA group. Postoperative BNP level was low in the MVR + PMTA group. While the postoperative left ventricular ejection fraction did not correlate with BNP levels, the postoperative slope significantly correlated with BNP level after surgery in the MVP + LVP group and in the total functional mitral regurgitation group. CONCLUSIONS: The change of slope was dependent on surgical procedures. In functional mitral regurgitation, the slope may be a more sensitive parameter in reflecting the left ventricular contractile function than the left ventricular ejection fraction.  "
Management of Ruptured Left Ventricular Outflow Tract.  ;Left ventricular outflow tract pseudoaneurysm is a potentially fatal complication after aortic root replacement. Challenges surrounding multiple reoperations on the aortic root include sternal reentry, bleeding, valve positioning, compression of coronary arteries, and navigating concomitant interventions. We present a 27-year-old patient with mechanical valves in the aortic and mitral positions and a left main coronary artery drug-eluting stent for left main compression after being diagnosed with rheumatic heart disease at age 16. She underwent a fourth redo modified Bentall procedure with a homemade mechanical composite graft for the contained rupture of an left ventricular outflow tract pseudoaneurysm.  
Minimally Invasive Bicuspid Aortic Valve Repair Using Geometric Ring Annuloplasty.  ;A 51-year-old man with congestive heart failure, Sievers type 1 bicuspid aortic valve, and severe aortic insufficiency had an upper mini-sternotomy. The annulus was sized to 27 mm, and the nonfused cusp to a 21-mm bicuspid ring. Using the geometric annuloplasty ring, two 180° subcommissural ring post sutures, 3 nonfused looping annular sutures, and 4 fused annular sutures were placed. Plication sutures raised noncoronary leaflet to a reference effective height of 10 mm, and fused leaflet cleft was closed linearly to the same effective height and length. Post-repair echocardiography showed good leaflet mobility, no residual leak, and a mean valve gradient of 10 mm Hg.

Percutaneous Aortic Valve Closure in Patient With Left Ventricular Assist Device and Dilated Aortic Annulus.  ;Percutaneous transcatheter intervention for aortic regurgitation secondary to implantation of a continuous-flow left ventricular assist device remains challenging, because of the minimal global experience with these procedures. Two treatment options are available: transcatheter aortic valve replacement, which is not always feasible when a dilated aortic annulus is present, and percutaneous aortic valve occlusion. We report a successful percutaneous closure of the aortic valve using an oversized Amplatzer patent foramen ovale multifenestrated device (St Jude Medical, Saint Paul, MN) to treat aortic regurgitation associated with dilated aortic annulus in a patient with a continuous-flow left ventricular assist device.

Ultrasonic annular debridement in minimally invasive aortic valve replacement.  ;Here, we demonstrate the details of annular decalcification using an ultrasonic aspirator in minimally invasive aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis. In our debridement procedure, the aortic valve leaflets are excised with enough valve tissue left, not just at the annulus. The invisible annulus is exposed by traction of the remnant valve tissue, and the annular calcifications are scraped off using an ultrasonic aspirator. After an annular decalcification, the remnant valve tissue was completely resected using long scissors. No cases of in-hospital mortality, annular injury, stroke, or paravalvular leakage were found. In conclusion, ultrasonic aspirator allowed safe and secure annular debridement and could be a useful tool during minimally invasive aortic valve replacement.

Interventions for Secondary Mitral Regurgitation in Patients With Heart Failure: A Network Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Comparisons of Surgery, Medical Therapy and Transcatheter Intervention.  ;"BACKGROUND: Mitral regurgitation (MR) in heart failure (HF) notoriously carries a poor prognosis. While there are multiple interventional options for treatment, the optimal intervention remains controversial. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of surgery, medical therapy, and transcatheter intervention in secondary MR. METHODS: A systematic database search was performed to identify all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluate various interventions for secondary MR. We performed a Bayesian network meta-analysis to calculate odd ratios (ORs) and 95% credible intervals (CIs). The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality. Secondary endpoints were moderate-severe MR, HF-hospitalizations, and freedom from severe HF symptoms. RESULTS: We identified 12 RCTs (2316 total patients; age 67.6 ± 11; 63% males, and 74% with ischemic cardiomyopathy). There was a significant reduction of mortality at 24-months with transcatheter leaflet repair compared with medical therapy (OR = 0.57; 95% CI = 0.34-0.96). However, there were no significant differences among the competing treatments in all-cause mortality at the earlier time points of 30-days or 12-months (P > 0.05). Recurrent moderate-severe MR was significantly less with valvular interventions compared with medical therapy (P < 0.05), but there were no differences in the rates of HF-hospitalizations or persistent severe HF symptoms between the competing interventions (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with HF and secondary MR, transcatheter leaflet repair was associated with significantly reduced 24-month mortality compared with medical therapy. Valvular interventions were associated with lower rates of recurrent moderate-severe MR, but non-significant improvements in clinical outcomes. Further long-term studies are needed to identify the best route of intervention for secondary MR.  "
Relationship of oral conditions to the incidence of infective endocarditis in periodontitis patients with valvular heart disease: a cross-sectional study.  ;"OBJECTIVES: Infective endocarditis (IE) is a life-threatening infectious disease, but the pathogenesis of the disease remains uncertain. The objective of this study was to examine whether oral infectious conditions are associated with the occurrence of IE in valvular heart disease (VHD) patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 119 periodontitis (P) patients with or without VHD were enrolled, and cross-sectional analyses were performed. Patients were classified as follows: (1) mild-to-moderate P without VHD, (2) mild-to-moderate P with VHD, (3) severe P without VHD, or (4) severe P with VHD. A total of 78 VHD patients were classified as (1) VHD without IE or (2) VHD with IE. Conditional logistic regression analysis was performed to compute the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: No significant differences were observed between patients with or without VHD in oral conditions. A significant increase in the percentage of alveolar bone loss in VHD patients with IE was observed compared with that of patients without IE. The ratio of both Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) IgG titer > 1.68 and Pg fimA type II genotype in patients with IE was significantly higher than in patients without IE. There was a significant correlation between the occurrence of IE and clinical oral findings (number of remaining teeth: OR, 0.17; rate of alveolar bone loss > 40%: OR, 11.8). CONCLUSIONS: VHD patients with IE might have severe periodontitis compared with patients without IE, although further investigation will be needed because this is based on only 7 VHD patients with IE. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The patients with IE had fewer remaining teeth, more advanced bone resorption compared with those of patients without IE. These findings suggest a possible association between the occurrence of IE and periodontal infection.  "
Clinical experience with trans-catheter aortic valve implantation at a tertiary hospital in the Republic of Ireland.  ;INTRODUCTION: There is a paucity of published data on the clinical experience with trans-catheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in the Republic of Ireland. We sought to examine the clinical outcomes of patients with medium-term follow-up treated with TAVI at our institution. METHODS: A prospective TAVI registry was used to assess the baseline demographics, procedural variables and clinical outcomes of patients treated with TAVI between the inception of the programme in 2008 and November 2017. RESULTS: A total of 354 patients (mean age 80.9 ± 8.1 years, 58% male, mean STS score 6.1 ± 4.3%) were treated during the study period. Major in-hospital outcomes included in-lab death (n = 2, 0.6%), stroke (n = 8, 2.2%), device embolisation (n = 4, 1.2%), permanent pacemaker implantation (n = 22, 6.2%) and major vascular complication (n = 2, 0.6%). The median length of hospital stay was 4 days (IQR 2-8 days). The Kaplan-Meier estimate of freedom from death at 30 days and 1 year for the entire cohort was 97 ± 1% and 85.4 ± 2.3%, respectively. Trans-femoral access was associated with a significantly lower rate of death and/or stroke at 1 year compared to trans-apical access (84.9 ± 2.4% versus 60 ± 8.9%, p = 0.0005). There was no significant difference in freedom from death and/or stroke at 1 year between balloon-expandable and self-expanding valves (81.6 ± 2.6% versus 84.4 ± 7.4%, p = 0.63). CONCLUSION: This study documents low complication rates and favourable rates of survival following TAVI in a consecutive series of patients undergoing TAVI at a tertiary referral centre in the Republic of Ireland. These data support the application of this therapy in the Irish context.

Aortic and Pulmonary Valve Reconstruction Using Autologous Pericardium in Narrow Annuli.  ;"A 71-year-old woman with pulmonary artery aneurysm had a complication of pulmonary valve stenosis with estimated right ventricular pressure 135 mm Hg and severe aortic valve stenosis with peak pressure gradient 112 mmHg. Coronary angiography revealed stenosis of the left coronary arterial system. Because she presented with narrow pulmonary annulus (16.7 mm) and aortic annulus (19.7 mm), we decided to perform aortic and pulmonary valve reconstruction using autologous pericardium. We performed aneurysmorrhaphy of the pulmonary artery, dual-valve reconstruction, and coronary artery bypass grafting. Postoperative echocardiography showed good opening of dual valves without regurgitation; estimated right ventricular pressure was 23 mm Hg.  "
The Clinical Impact of Psoas Muscle Cross-Sectional Area on Medium-Term Mortality After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.  ;"AIM: Psoas muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) is a proposed marker of frailty associated with mortality after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). We assessed the impact of psoas CSA on medium-term mortality over 5 years in a large cohort, adjusted for pre-procedural variables. METHOD: This single-centre registry-derived analysis assessed 1,731 consecutive TAVI patients between 2007 and 31 April 2015 with available abdominal computed tomography scans. Sex-stratified, height-adjusted psoas CSA was measured mid-body of the fourth lumbar vertebra. Kaplan-Meier survival distributions across psoas CSA quartiles were compared. Cox and logistic regression models were used to assess baseline variables associated with the primary outcome, which was mortality within 5 years. RESULTS: Median age was 81 years (interquartile range, 77 - 85); 52.5% were women. The primary endpoint occurred in 555 patients over a mean follow-up of 775 days. Lower psoas CSA quartile patients were older, had a lower body mass index, lower creatinine clearance, and lower rates of previous cardiac surgery, with higher rates of diabetes, coronary artery disease, pacemaker, anaemia, hypoalbuminaemia, and higher European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation (EuroSCORE). Unadjusted survival by psoas CSA quartile was significantly different in men (log rank p=0.041) but not women (p=0.099). In Bonferroni-adjusted multivariate analysis, psoas CSA quartiles were not significantly associated with mortality. Hypoalbuminaemia (hazard ratio [HR], 2.10; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.53 - 2.87 [p<0.001]) and increasing age (HR, 1.03 per year; 95% CI, 1.01 - 1.05 [p=0.002]) were associated with increased risk; female sex (HR, 0.63; 95% CI 0.51 - 0.78 [p<0.001]), and hypercholesterolaemia (HR, 0.67; 95%, CI 0.54 0.83 [p<0.001]) with reduced risk. CONCLUSIONS: Psoas CSA was not significantly associated with mortality after adjusting for pre-procedural variables. Hypoalbuminaemia, sex, hypercholesterolaemia, and age were significantly associated with mortality after TAVI.  "
Repair of Aortic Valve Insufficiency and Ascending Aortic Aneurysm Using Geometric Ring Annuloplasty.  ;This video demonstrates aortic valve repair during ascending aneurysm replacement for a 71-year-old man with congestive heart failure, grade 3 aortic insufficiency, and a 5.4-cm ascending aneurysm. On testing, the noncoronary leaflet is prolapsing, the annulus is 27 mm, and the leaflets size to a 21-mm ring. The ring is sutured beneath the aortic valve annulus with nine horizontal mattress sutures. The noncoronary leaflet is plicated, correcting the prolapse. A 28-mm Dacron tube graft (Maquet Hemashield, Baden-Württemberg, Germany) is sutured to the supracoronary and distal aorta. After repair, aortic insufficiency is trivial with a mean systolic gradient of 9 mm Hg. The patient recovered uneventfully.  
Nakata index above 1500 mm2/m2 predicts death in absent pulmonary valve syndrome.  ;"OBJECTIVES: Absent pulmonary valve syndrome is a rare congenital heart disease with severe airway compression due to dilatation of the pulmonary arteries (PAs). We investigated risk factors for death and prolonged mechanical ventilation (>7 days) and a threshold PA size for these outcomes. METHODS: This retrospective 2-centre cohort study included 68 patients with complete repair between January 1996 and December 2015. RESULTS: Median age at repair was 3.9 months (1.3-8.7 months), and median weight was 5 kg (4-7 kg). The mortality rate before hospital discharge was 12%, and the mortality rate at last follow-up was 19%. In multivariable analysis, risk factors for death were higher Nakata index [hazard ratio (HR) 1.001, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.001-1.002; P < 0.001] and lower SpO2 (HR 1.06, 95% CI 1.02-1.09; P = 0.002). The accuracy of the Nakata index to predict death was excellent (area under the curve at 6 months: 0.92; P = 0.010). A Nakata index above 1500 mm2/m2 predicted mortality at 6 months with a sensitivity of 98% and a specificity of 82%. Twenty-five patients (37%) had prolonged mechanical ventilation. The only multivariable risk factor for prolonged ventilation was lower weight at repair (odds ratio 2.9, 95% CI 1.3-6.7; P = 0.008). Neither PA plasty nor the LeCompte manoeuvre had a protective effect on mortality or prolonged ventilation. A Nakata index above 1500 mm2/m2 remained a risk factor for mortality (P = 0.022) in patients who had a PA plasty or the LeCompte manoeuvre. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with absent pulmonary valve syndrome, the Nakata index predicts mortality with a cut-off of 1500 mm2/m2. Lower weight at repair is the only multivariable risk factor for prolonged ventilation. Neither PA plasty nor the LeCompte manoeuvre had a protective effect on these outcomes.  "
Coronary Embolism: A Systematic Review.  ;"BACKGROUND: Coronary embolism is a rare and potentially fatal phenomenon that occurs primarily in patients with valvular heart disease and atrial fibrillation. There is a lack of consensus regarding the diagnosis, treatment, and management of coronary embolism, leaving management at the discretion of the treating physician. Through this review, we aim to establish a better understanding of coronary embolism, and to identify treatment options - invasive and non-invasive - that may be used to manage coronary embolism. METHODS AND RESULTS: Our systematic review included 147 documented cases of coronary embolism from case reports and case series. The average age of our population was 54.2 ± 17.6 years. The most common causes of coronary embolism included infective endocarditis (22.4%), atrial fibrillation (17.0%), and prosthetic heart valve thrombosis (16.3%). Initial presentation was indistinguishable from an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) due to coronary atherosclerosis, and the diagnosis required a high level of suspicion and evaluation with angiography. Treatment strategies included, but were not limited to, thrombectomy, thrombolysis, balloon angioplasty and stent placement. Myocardial dysfunction on echocardiography was observed in over 80% of patients following coronary embolism. ""Good outcomes"" were reported in 68.7% of case reports and case series, with a mortality rate of 12.9%. CONCLUSION: Coronary embolism is an under-recognized etiology of myocardial infarction with the potential for significant morbidity and mortality. To improve outcomes, physicians should strive for early diagnosis and intervention based on the underlying etiology. Thrombectomy may be considered with the goal of rapid restoration of coronary flow.  "
Mid-Term Outcome for Anomalous Origin of the Left Coronary Artery From the Pulmonary Artery.  ;BACKGROUND: This study is a single-centre experience with surgical intervention of anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA). METHODS: A retrospective review was performed of patients who underwent ALCAPA repair between November 1991 and October 2017. RESULTS: A total of 138 patients with a median age of 36 months underwent ALCAPA repair. The median follow-up period was 3.5 years. Overall, 114 (82.6%) patients received coronary reimplantation, 21 (15.2%) underwent Takeuchi repair, and three (2.1%) were treated by closure of the ALCAPA plus coronary artery bypass graft. Concomitant mitral repair was performed in 50 patients with moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation (MR). Three (2.1%) patients died in hospital. Three (2.1%) patients needed extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support. Seven (5.0%) patients needed delayed sternal closure. In patients with decreased preoperative left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (<50%), the LVEF significantly improved from 25% to 33% at discharge (p = 0.001). The percentage of more than moderately significant MR decreased from 36.2% to 5.2% (p = 0.02). There was no late mortality. Two patients needed reoperation because of baffle leaks after Takeuchi repair. Three patients had severe MR. All patients had normal LVEF at last follow-up. The median normalisation time of left ventricular function was 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: Short-term and mid-term outcomes of surgical treatment for ALCAPA patients were excellent. The concomitant mitral valve repair did not increase the perioperative risk but had satisfactory mid-term outcomes. Normalisation of left ventricular function is expected within the first 6 months.

Patients with severe aortic stenosis and coexisting pulmonary hypertension treated by transapical transcatheter aortic valve replacement-Is there a need for increased attention?  ;"OBJECTIVES: Aim of this study is to elucidate the impact of pulmonary hypertension on patients treated with a transapical aortic valve replacement. BACKGROUND: In patients with aortic stenosis (AS) the coexistence of pulmonary hypertension (PH) is associated with increased peri-operative risk for surgical aortic valve replacement. For transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), it is unknown whether transapical TAVR (TA-TAVR) is associated with increased peri-interventional risk in PH patients. METHODS: We performed a single center analysis in 189 patients with severe AS with (AS + PH) or without PH (AS - PH) undergoing TA-TAVR. PH was defined by mean pulmonary artery pressure ≥25 mmHg assessed by right heart catheterization (exclusion of 64 patients due to missing results). As the primary endpoint a combination of 30-day mortality or cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was analyzed. RESULTS: Seventy three patients (58.4%) had PH. Increased peri-interventional risk in AS + PH patients was reflected by an increased rate of the primary endpoint in comparison to AS - PH patients (24.7 vs. 3.8%; p = .002). A higher proportion of acute kidney injury (34.2 vs. 15.7%; p = .025) was found in AS + PH patients while AS - PH patients showed a higher rate of bleeding in comparison AS + PH patients (18.5 vs. 6.8% p = .050). CONCLUSION: Patients with AS + PH treated by TA-TAVR are at increased peri-interventional risk for severe complications in comparison to AS - PH patients. Therefore, the identification of preventive therapeutic strategies is needed. CLASSIFICATIONS: TAVR, transapical, pulmonary hypertension, aortic stenosis.  "

High-Sensitivity Troponin T Predicts Postoperative Cardiogenic Shock Requiring Mechanical Circulatory Support in Patients With Valve Disease.  ;"BACKGROUND: Cardiogenic shock is a very serious postoperative complication in patients undergoing heart valve surgery. Mechanical circulatory support is a recognized method of treating patients with this complication. The aim of the presented study was to assess the usefulness of selected biomarkers in predicting the occurrence of postoperative cardiogenic shock requiring mechanical circulatory support. METHODS: This prospective study was conducted on a group of 712 patients undergoing heart valve surgery. The primary end-point at the intrahospital follow-up was postoperative cardiogenic shock requiring mechanical circulatory support. RESULTS: The postoperative cardiogenic shock requiring mechanical circulatory support occurred in 20 patients. At multivariate analysis high-sensitivity Troponin T measured immediately after surgery (OR 1.006; 95% CI 1.002-1.013; P 0.009) remained independent predictor of the primary end point. CONCLUSIONS: The postoperative hs-TnT can be used to predict a postoperative cardiogenic shock requiring mechanical circulatory support.  "
Computed Tomography-Determined Muscle Quality Rather Than Muscle Quantity Is a Better Determinant of Prolonged Hospital Length of Stay in Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.  ;RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Computed tomography (CT)-determined skeletal muscle measures have been used for predicting postoperative outcomes in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). We investigated the impact of CT-determined muscle quantity (measured as psoas muscle area [PMA] and psoas muscle index [PMI]) and quality (measured as psoas muscle density [PMD]) on hospital length of stay (LOS) after TAVI. METHODS: We retrospectively identified 182 consecutive patients who underwent TAVI between March 2013 and August 2017 with adequate preprocedural CT imaging. Baseline demographic and clinical data, the Society of Thoracic Surgeons score, the essential frailty toolset (EFT) frailty rating, and precontrast PMD, PMA, and PMI were obtained in all study patients. The primary outcome was prolonged postoperative LOS defined as greater than 14 days. RESULTS: Patients with prolonged LOS had a significantly higher Society of Thoracic Surgeons score (p < 0.001) and significantly lower PMD (p < 0.001) than those with LOS ≤14 days. More patients with prolonged LOS had concomitant peripheral vascular disease (p  = 0.001), had undergone percutaneous coronary interventions (p = 0.022), and had an EFT score ≥4 (p < 0.001) compared to those without prolonged LOS. Neither PMA (p = 0.123) nor PMI (p = 0.271) were associated with prolonged LOS. Multivariate analysis identified EFT score ≥4, the presence of peripheral vascular disease, and PMD as independent predictors of prolonged LOS. CONCLUSION: The precontrast CT-determined muscle quality measurement PMD is a simple and objective predictor of prolonged LOS after TAVI.  
Delirium is associated with higher mortality in transcatheter aortic valve replacement: systemic review and meta-analysis.  ;Post-operative delirium (POD) has been recognized as an independent risk factor for mortality. Recent studies suggest that POD is associated with higher mortality rates in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). However, a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature has not been performed. This study assessed the association between POD and TAVR by performing a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature. We comprehensively searched the databases of MEDLINE and EMBASE from inception to April 2018. Included studies were prospective or retrospective cohort studies that compared mortality among patients undergoing TAVR both with and without POD. Data from each study were combined using the random-effects, generic inverse variance method of DerSimonian and Laird to calculate risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Seven studies consisting of 20,086 subjects undergoing TAVR (1517 with POD and 18,569 without POD) were included in this meta-analysis. POD demonstrated a trend towards higher all-cause mortality (pooled odd ratio 1.52, 95% confidence interval 0.98-2.37, p = 0.062, I2 = 72%). POD was associated with a significant increased long-term mortality (pooled odd ratio 2.11, 95% confidence interval 1.21-3.68, p = 0.009, I2 = 62.5%). POD was associated with an increased risk of long-term all-cause mortality in patients undergoing TAVR. Our study suggests POD could be a potential risk factor of mortality among patients undergoing TAVR. Further studies implementing preventative and treatment strategies against delirium and its effect on POD and its associated mortality are needed.  
Combined Replacement and Subvalvular Repair for Functional Mitral Regurgitation: The New Frontier?  ;"Comment in Ann Thorac Surg. 2020 Jan;109(1):304.  "
Role of comprehensive geriatric assessment in low surgical risk older patients with aortic stenosis.  ;BACKGROUND: Among elderly with severe aortic stenosis (AS), Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) originally contributed to address to transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) patients not suitable to surgical aortic valve replacement(SAVR). Nevertheless, TAVI has recently been proposed also in lower surgical risk patients. AIMS: To evaluate predictors of TAVI procedure and clinical outcomes among these patients. METHODS: For each patient ≥ 65 years with severe AS referring to our Cardiac Surgery Division, CGA was performed, including functional and cognitive status, comorbidity burden, frailty, nutritional status, gait speed, hand-grip strength and number of medications. Surgical risk was evaluated according to the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) score (low-risk < 4%). Post-procedural outcomes (30-day survival and post-procedural complications) were obtained by medical records and a one-year follow-up assessed survival, and functional and cognitive performance. RESULTS: Among 154 subjects (mean age 82.9 years), 52 were at low-risk according to STS score. 32 patients were addressed to TAVI, 20 to SAVR. Variables significantly associated with TAVI-approach were lower gait speed (p 0.030) and higher number of medications (p 0.015). Short and long-term outcomes did not differ between groups. DISCUSSION: Among CGA variables, gait speed and number of medications were associated with the decision to perform TAVI instead of SAVR, even in patients at low surgical risk. 30-day and one-year survival and one-year functional and cognitive decline were similar between groups, despite a relevant prevalence of frailty in the TAVI group. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that gait speed and number of medications should be considered in selecting appropriate candidates to TAVI among low surgical risk patients.  
Malnutrition among elderly patients with severe aortic stenosis.  ;BACKGROUND: Most patients with aortic stenosis (AS) are elderly. To achieve favorable outcomes after interventional treatments, careful management including adequate nutritional support is required. However, there has been a lack of knowledge about the prevalence of malnutrition and factors related to it. AIMS: To explore the prevalence of malnutrition and its related factors in patients with severe AS. METHODS: This was a single-institution, cross-sectional study. A total of 300 consecutive older patients (mean age, 83.8 ± 0.5 years) with AS were prospectively enrolled. Nutritional status was evaluated with the Mini Nutritional Assessment-Short Form (MNA-SF). Cardiac, kidney, physical, cognitive functions, instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) as measured with the Frenchay Activities Index (FAI), medical history, and comorbidities were evaluated as potentially related factors. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors that were significantly associated with the MNA-SF. RESULTS: The mean (SD) score of the MNA-SF was 10.9 (2.5). 34 patients (11.3%) and 127 patients (42.3%) met the criteria for malnutrition and at risk of malnutrition, respectively. On multiple logistic regression analysis, female sex (OR 3.455, 95% CI 1.045-11.42, P = 0.042), NYHA class (OR 3.625, 95% CI 1.627-8.074, P = 0.002), left ventricular ejection fraction (/10%) (OR 0.961, 95% CI 0.932-0.991, P = 0.010), and FAI score (/10 points) (OR 0.911, 95% CI 0.864-0.961, P < 0.001) were significantly related to malnutrition. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of malnutrition was high among older persons with severe AS, and female sex, poor cardiac function, and lower IADL were independently related to it.  
Successful staged repair of pulmonary atresia, ventricular septal defect, and major aortopulmonary collateral arteries in an extremely low birth weight infant.  ;An extremely low birth weight infant (810 g) was born with pulmonary atresia, ventricular septal defect, and major aortopulmonary collateral arteries accompanied by pulmonary overcirculation, which eventually resulted in intestinal hypoperfusion and focal intestinal perforation from the very early stage of life. Based on the echographic findings, we performed banding operations twice to regulate the pulmonary blood flow on day 2 and day 9. At 6 months of age, a definitive repair simultaneous with unifocalization of major aortopulmonary collateral arteries was performed. At 1 year of age, the right ventricle/left ventricle pressure ratio was 0.44 after balloon angioplasty was performed for the right-sided pulmonary artery stenosis. The patient is in a stable condition and was followed-up for more than 2 years after definitive repair. This is the first known successful repair of pulmonary atresia, ventricular septal defect, and major aortopulmonary collateral arteries in an extremely low birth weight infant.  
Surgical intervention for ischemic mitral regurgitation: how can we achieve better outcomes?  ;"Ischemic mitral regurgitation (MR) is a common complication of myocardial infarction. Left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and distortion of the subvalvular apparatus are the main contributors to ischemic MR. Coronary artery bypass grafting alone, mitral valve replacement, and mitral valve repair, with or without subvalvular procedures, have been performed for moderate-to-severe ischemic MR. Several randomized studies on the surgical treatment of ischemic MR have been performed; however, the optimal surgical strategy remains controversial because none have demonstrated a clear survival benefit. Since the mechanisms of ischemic MR are complex and multifactorial, comprehensive preoperative assessment of LV function and geometry (both global and regional), mitral valve configuration, viability testing, and exercise echocardiography are needed. A better understanding of this complicated disease and of the advantages and limitations of each procedure may help us devise more effective patient-specific surgical treatment strategies and achieve better outcomes.

Elevated ventricular filling pressures and long-term survival in adults post-Fontan.  ;"OBJECTIVE: To assess the association between elevated ventricular-end diastolic pressures (VEDP) and pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP) on long-term survival in adult Fontan patients. BACKGROUND: The impact of ventricular filling pressures on long-term survival in adults post-Fontan palliation is unknown. METHODS: We included 148 adult Fontan patients (age ≥ 18 years) without atrioventricular valve prosthesis or pulmonary vein stenosis undergoing arterial and venous catheterization between December 1999 and November 2017. VEDP was defined as ≥12 mmHg and PAWP as >12 mmHg based on optimal cut-offs for prediction of mortality on receiver-operator curves (AUC 0.63 and 0.66, respectively). RESULTS: Mean age was 31.3 ± 9.2 years and 48.6% of patients were females. Most common congenital defects were tricuspid atresia (36.4%) and double-inlet left ventricle (28.3%); 59.5% patients had atriopulmonary Fontan connections. Mean VEDP was 11.5 ± 4.7 mmHg and PAWP 10.6 ± 4.5 mmHg (correlation coefficient .76). During a follow-up of 6.0 ± 4.8 years (median 5.4, IQR 1.4-9.4), there were 45 deaths (30.4%). Overall survival was lower in patients with VEDP ≥ 12 compared to those with VEDP < 12 mmHg (p = .02). Similarly, survival was lower in patients with PAWP>12 compared to patients with PAWP ≤ 12 mmHg (p < .0001). In the multivariate model, PAWP was an independent predictor of death (HR 1.1 per mmHg, 95% CI 1.02-1.15, p = .009) whereas VEDP was not (HR 1.1 per mmHg, 95% CI 1.0-1.13; p = .08). CONCLUSION: PAWP but not VEDP was independently associated with long-term overall mortality in adult Fontan patients. Perhaps PAWP rather than VEDP should be used in the risk stratification of these patients.  "
"Nucleotide ecto-enzyme metabolic pattern and spatial distribution in calcific aortic valve disease; its relation to pathological changes and clinical presentation.  ";"BACKGROUND: Extracellular nucleotide metabolism contributes to chronic inflammation, cell differentiation, and tissue mineralization by controlling nucleotide and adenosine concentrations and hence its purinergic effects. This study investigated location-specific changes of extracellular nucleotide metabolism in aortic valves of patients with calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD). Individual ecto-enzymes and adenosine receptors involved were analyzed together with correlation with CAVD severity and risk factors. RESULTS: Nucleotide and adenosine degradation rates were adversely modified on the aortic surface of stenotic valve as compared to ventricular side, including decreased ATP removal (1.25 ± 0.35 vs. 2.24 ± 0.61 nmol/min/cm2) and adenosine production (1.32 ± 0.12 vs. 2.49 ± 0.28 nmol/min/cm2) as well as increased adenosine deamination (1.28 ± 0.31 vs. 0.67 ± 0.11 nmol/min/cm2). The rates of nucleotide to adenosine conversions were lower, while adenosine deamination was higher on the aortic sides of stenotic vs. non-stenotic valve. There were no differences in extracellular nucleotide metabolism between aortic and ventricular sides of non-stenotic valves. Furthermore, nucleotide degradation rates, measured on aortic side in CAVD (n = 62), negatively correlated with echocardiographic and biochemical parameters of disease severity (aortic jet velocity vs. ATP hydrolysis: r = - 0.30, p < 0.05; vs. AMP hydrolysis: r = - 0.44, p < 0.001; valvular phosphate concentration vs. ATP hydrolysis: r = - 0.26, p < 0.05; vs. AMP hydrolysis: r = - 0.25, p = 0.05) while adenosine deamination showed positive correlation trend with valvular phosphate deposits (r = 0.23, p = 0.07). Nucleotide and adenosine conversion rates also correlated with CAVD risk factors, including hyperlipidemia (AMP hydrolysis vs. serum LDL cholesterol: r = - 0.28, p = 0.05; adenosine deamination vs. total cholesterol: r = 0.25, p = 0.05; LDL cholesterol: r = 0.28, p < 0.05; triglycerides: r = 0.32, p < 0.05), hypertension (adenosine deamination vs. systolic blood pressure: r = 0.28, p < 0.05) and thrombosis (ATP hydrolysis vs. prothrombin time: r = - 0.35, p < 0.01). Functional assays as well as histological and immunofluorescence, flow cytometry and RT-PCR studies identified all major ecto-enzymes engaged in nucleotide metabolism in aortic valves that included ecto-nucleotidases, alkaline phosphatase, and ecto-adenosine deaminase. We have shown that changes in nucleotide-converting ecto-enzymes were derived from their altered activities on valve cells and immune cell infiltrate. We have also demonstrated a presence of A1, A2a and A2b adenosine receptors with diminished expression of A2a and A2b in stenotic vs. non-stenotic valves. Finally, we revealed that augmenting adenosine effects by blocking adenosine deamination with deoxycoformycin decreased aortic valve thickness and reduced markers of calcification via adenosine-dependent pathways in a mouse model of CAVD. CONCLUSIONS: This work highlights profound changes in extracellular nucleotide and adenosine metabolism in CAVD. Altered extracellular nucleotide hydrolysis and degradation of adenosine in stenotic valves may affect purinergic responses to support a pro-stenotic milieu and valve calcification. This emphasizes a potential mechanism and target for prevention and therapy. .  "
Fracture of small Mitroflow® aortic bioprosthesis following valve-in-valve transcatheter aortic valve replacement with ACURATE neo valve-From bench testing to clinical practice.  ;Valve-in-valve (ViV) transcatheter procedures have emerged as a feasible, less-invasive treatment option for bioprosthetic structural valve deterioration. However, in the presence of a small bioprosthesis, a significant residual gradient after ViV procedures often occurs and has been associated with poorer clinical outcomes. We report the use of the self-expandable supra-annular ACURATE neo™ valve to treat degenerated Mitroflow (Sorin) aortic bioprosthesis with severe residual elevated gradients followed by valve fracture with a postdilation using a noncompliant balloon leading to significant reduction in residual gradients. In conclusion, the use of ACURATE neo™ valve followed by the controlled fracture of the surgical bioprosthesis frame with a noncompliant balloon is a safe and effective approach for patients with Mitroflow® failing valves and residual elevated gradient after transcatheter aortic valve replacement.  
Meta-Analysis and Meta-Regression of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation for Pure Native Aortic Regurgitation.  ;"AIM: To assess outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) for pure native aortic regurgitation (AR) and to evaluate whether 30-day all-cause mortality is modulated by patient characteristics, we performed a meta-analysis and meta-regression of currently available studies. METHOD: Studies enrolling ≥20 patients undergoing TAVI for AR were considered for inclusion. Study-specific estimates (incidence rates of outcomes) were combined using one-group meta-analysis in a random-effects model. Subgroup meta-analysis of studies exclusively using early-generation devices (EGD) and new-generation devices (NGD) and stepwise random-effects multivariate meta-regression were also performed. RESULTS: The search identified 11 eligible studies including a total of 911 patients undergoing TAVI for AR. Pooled analysis demonstrated an incidence of device success of 80.4% (NGD 90.2%, EGD 67.2%; p < 0.001), moderate or higher paravalvular aortic regurgitation (PAR) of 7.4% (NGD 3.4%, EGD 17.3%; p < 0.001), 30-day all-cause mortality of 9.5% (NGD 6.1%, EGD 14.7%; p < 0.001), mid-term (4 mo - 1 yr) all-cause mortality of 18.8% (NGD 11.8%, EGD 32.2%; p < 0.001), life-threatening/major bleeding complications (BC) 5.7% (NGD 3.5%, EGD 12.4%; p = 0.015), and major vascular complications (MVC) of 3.9% (NGD 3.0%, EGD 6.2%; p = 0.041). All coefficients in the multivariate meta-regression adjusting simultaneously for the proportion of diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, peripheral arterial disease, concomitant moderate or higher mitral regurgitation, and mean left ventricular ejection fraction (with significant coefficients in the univariate meta-regression) were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Thirty (30)-day all-cause mortality after TAVI for AR was high (9.5%) with a high incidence of moderate or higher PAR (7.4%). Compared with EGD, NGD was associated with significantly higher device success rates and significantly lower rates of second-valve deployment, moderate or higher PAR, 30-day/mid-term all-cause mortality, serious BC, and MVC.

Exercise haemodynamics after restrictive mitral annuloplasty for functional mitral regurgitation.  ;AIMS: Restrictive mitral annuloplasty (RMA) can provide a durable solution for functional mitral regurgitation (MR), but might result in obstruction to antegrade mitral flow. Aim of this study was to assess the magnitude of change in mitral valve area (MVA) during exercise after RMA, to relate the change in MVA to left ventricular (LV) geometry and function, and to assess its haemodynamic and clinical impact. METHODS AND RESULTS: Bicycle exercise echocardiography was performed in 32 patients after RMA. Echocardiographic data at rest and during exercise were compared with preoperative echocardiographic data. Clinical endpoints were collected following the study visit. MVA increased during exercise in 25 patients (1.6 ± 0.4 cm2 to 2.0 ± 0.6 cm2, P < 0.001), whereas MVA decreased in 7 patients (1.8 ± 0.5 cm2 to 1.5 ± 0.4 cm2, P = 0.020). Patients with an increased MVA showed a significant reduction in LV volumes at rest compared to preoperatively, and an increase in stroke volume and cardiac output (CO) during exercise. In patients with decreased MVA, LV reverse remodelling was absent and myocardial flow reserve limited. Patients with decreased exercise MVA had a higher increase in mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) with respect to CO and worse survival 36 months after the study visit (69±19% vs. 92±5%, P = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Both increased and decreased MVA were observed during exercise echocardiography after RMA for functional MR. Change in MVA was related to the extent of LV geometrical and functional changes. A decreased MVA during exercise was associated with a higher increase in mean PAP with respect to CO, and worse survival.  
Abnormal aortic flow profiles persist after aortic valve replacement in the majority of patients with aortic valve disease: how model-based personalized therapy planning could improve results. A pilot study approach.  ;"OBJECTIVES: Complex blood flow profiles in the aorta are known to contribute to vessel dilatation. We studied flow profiles in the aorta in patients with aortic valve disease before and after surgical aortic valve replacement (AVR). METHODS: Thirty-four patients with aortic valve disease underwent 4-dimensional velocity-encoded magnetic resonance imaging before and after AVR (biological valve = 27, mechanical valve = 7). Seven healthy volunteers served as controls. Eccentricity (ES) and complex flow scores (CFS) were determined from the degree of helicity, vorticity and eccentricity of flow profiles in the aorta. Model-based therapy planning was used in 4 cases to improve in silico postoperative flow profiles by personalized adjustment of size, rotation and angulation of the valve as well as aorta diameter. RESULTS: Patients with aortic valve disease showed more complex flow than controls [median ES 2.5 (interquartile range (IQR) 2.3-2.7) vs 1.0 (IQR 1.0-1.0), P < 0.001, median CFS 4.7 (IQR 4.3-4.8) vs 1.0 (IQR 1.0-2.0), P < 0.001]. After surgery, flow complexity in the total patient cohort was reduced, but remained significantly higher compared to controls [median ES 2.3 (IQR 1.9-2.3) vs 1.0 (IQR 1.0-1.0), P < 0.001, median CFS 3.8 (IQR 3.0-4.3) vs 1.0 (IQR 1.0-2.0), P < 0.001]. In patients after mechanical AVR, flow complexity fell substantially and showed no difference from controls [median ES 1.0 (IQR 1.0-2.3) vs 1.0 (IQR 1.0-1.0), P = 0.46, median CFS 1.0 (IQR 1.0-3.3) vs 1.0 (IQR 1.0-2.0), P = 0.71]. In all 4 selected cases (biological, n = 2; mechanical, n = 2), model-based therapy planning reduced in silico complexity of flow profiles compared to the existing post-surgical findings [median ES 1.7 (IQR 1.4-1.7) vs 2.3 (IQR 2.3-2.3); CFS 1.7 (IQR 1.4-2.5) vs 3.8 (IQR 3.3-4.3)]. CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal flow profiles in the aorta more frequently persist after surgical AVR. Model-based therapy planning might have the potential to optimize treatment for best possible individual outcome.

Nutritional status and risk of all-cause mortality in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement assessment using the geriatric nutritional risk index and the controlling nutritional status score.  ;"BACKGROUND: Nutritional status, a key marker of patient frailty, is an important prognostic factor after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Few investigations have evaluated the clinical usefulness of nutritional assessment tools for predicting the risk of mortality following TAVR. METHODS: A total of 412 patients with symptomatic severe AS who underwent TAVR between March 2010 and August 2017 were stratified into subgroups by their Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index [GNRI, low ≤ 98 vs. high > 98 (better nutritional status)] and Controlling Nutritional Status (CONUT) score [low ≤ 3 vs. high ≥ 4; (poorer nutritional status)]. The primary study outcome was all-cause mortality at 1 year. RESULTS: Patients with low GNRI score showed a significantly higher 1-year mortality rate as compared to those with high GNRI score (13.0% vs. 3.2%, respectively; P = 0.001). Similarly, patients with high CONUT score had a significantly higher rate of 1-year mortality than those with low CONUT score (15.7% vs. 6.2%, respectively; P = 0.005). However, in multivariable Cox proportional-hazards models, low GNRI was the only independent predictor of mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 3.77; 95% confidence interval 1.54-9.20; P = 0.004). Overall, integration of GNRI into conventional risk models of STS score or logistic EuroSCORE resulted in improved predictive value for mortality measured by the net reclassification improvement and the integrated discrimination improvement. CONCLUSIONS: In patients undergoing TAVR, low GNRI (but not high CONUT score) was independently associated with a higher risk of 1-year mortality. Further research is required to determine whether nutritional screening and management can improve clinical outcomes in patients undergoing TAVR.  "
Early outcomes of transcatheter mitral valve replacement for degenerated bioprosthesis in Japanese (MITRAL VIV study): a four-case series.  ;"OBJECTIVE: The mitral valve-in-valve procedure has been performed in the world. However, the early clinical outcomes in Japan remain unclear. Hence, we investigated the feasibility, safety, and efficacy in high-risk Japanese patients. METHODS: In May 2017, we launched the present clinical study of the mitral valve-in-valve procedure (MITRAL VIV study). The study enrolled four patients (three women; age range 69-85 years) with severe mitral regurgitation due to a degenerated mitral bioprosthesis. The median Society of Thoracic Surgeons score was 8.8 (range 8.4-9.8)%. RESULTS: In all patients, the mitral valve-in-valve procedure was successfully performed via a transapical approach at the initial attempt. The median grade of mitral insufficiency improved from grade 4 (range 3-4) to grade 1 (range 0-1) at days 7 and 30. The mean mitral pressure gradient of the median value changed from 7.0 (range 5.0-8.0) mmHg to 5.0 (range 5.0-9.5) mmHg at 7 days and 6.2 (range 4.0-11.0) mmHg at 30 days. The median New York Heart Association functional class improved from 2 (range 2-3) to 1 (range 1-3) at day 7 and to 1 (range 1-2) at day 30. We performed a bit deep implantation intentionally to avoid left ventricular outflow tract obstruction in one patient with a small aorto-mitral-annular angle. Neither mortality nor severe complications were observed at the last follow-up (range 207-513 days). CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, the safe mitral valve-in-valve procedure was feasible with cautious procedures.  "

Transcatheter aortic valve implantation in severe calcified annulus using the Lotus valve system: Increased incidence of fatal major vascular complications.  ;"OBJECTIVES: This study reports the outcome of a highly selected transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) population. BACKGROUND: In patients with aortic valve stenosis and severe calcification of the left ventricular outflow tract and/or the annulus, the Boston Scientific Lotus valve provided a low paravalvular leakage rate omitting the risk of annular rupture. METHODS: Until now more than 3,600 TAVI procedures were performed at our institution. Between 8/2015 and 2/2017, 634 TAVI procedures were performed, of which 80 TAVI patients with severe calcifications consecutively received the Lotus valve. Valve Academic Research Consortium (VARC)-2 criteria of these procedures were prospectively documented in our institutional TAVI registry. One year follow-up for the Lotus treated patients was completed. RESULTS: Mean age was 82.0 ± 5.5 years. Device success was 95.0%. Conversion was required in two cases (2.5%). New permanent pacemaker implantation rate was 33.3%. Vascular complications occurred more frequent in comparison to non-Lotus treated patients (13.8 vs. 8.1%; p < .05): five minor and six major vascular complications (6.3 and 7.5%), including four fatal aortic injuries (three acute aortic dissections type A, one rupture of the aortic arch). Seventy-two-hour and 30-day mortality rates were also higher in Lotus patients (6.3 and 12.5% vs. 0.3 and 2.5%; each p < .05). One-year mortality in Lotus patients was 22.5%. CONCLUSIONS: In TAVI procedures with the Lotus valve occurrence of vascular complications including lethal aortic injuries and mortality rates were considerably high. Furthermore, in every TAVI procedure careful examination of the aorta should be mandatory and be a part of planning it.  "
Prognostic impact and periprocedural complications of chronic steroid therapy in patients following transcatheter aortic valve replacement: Propensity-matched analysis from the Japanese OCEAN registry.  ;"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the effect of chronic steroid use on periprocedural complications and clinical outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). BACKGROUND: Chronic steroid use increases the risk of periprocedural complications and mortality during surgery. METHODS: We investigated 1,313 consecutive patients with aortic stenosis who underwent transfemoral (TF)-TAVR using data from a Japanese multicenter registry. The baseline characteristics, periprocedural complications including vascular complications (VCs), access route related VCs, and clinical outcomes were compared between patients in the steroid group and nonsteroid group. RESULTS: Major VCs and access route VCs occurred more in the steroid group than in the nonsteroid group (13.4 vs. 5.8%, p = .019; 20.9% vs. 9.8%, p = .004). Especially in the surgical cut-down group, the rate of access route VCs was differed between the two groups (28.0% vs. 7.5%, p = .003). The 30-day mortality rates were similar between the two groups (0% vs. 1.4%, p = .39). In the propensity score-matched model, the higher incidence of major VCs in the steroid group was maintained, although early mortality was similar in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Although chronic steroid therapy is not associated with increased early mortality, chronic steroid use may affect periprocedural VCs and access route VCs mainly due to surgical cut-down in patients following TF-TAVR.

Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: Role of Multimodality Imaging in Common and Complex Clinical Scenarios.  ;Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is an established therapy for patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis. Technological advances and the learning curve have resulted in better procedural results in terms of hemodynamic valve performance and intermediate-term clinical outcomes. The integration of anatomical and functional information provided by multimodality imaging has improved size selection of TAVR prostheses, permitted better patient selection, and provided new insights in the performance of the TAVR prostheses at follow-up. Furthermore, the field of TAVR continues to develop and expand the technique to younger patients with lower risk on the one hand, and more complex clinical scenarios, on the other hand, such as degenerated aortic bioprostheses, bicuspid aortic valves, or pure native aortic regurgitation. The present review article summarizes how multimodality imaging can be integrated in TAVR in clinical (sometimes complex) scenarios that have not been included in the landmark randomized clinical trials.  
Outcome of Patients with Low-Gradient Aortic Stenosis Undergoing Transcatheter or Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement.  ;BACKGROUND: Patients with low-gradient (LG) severe aortic stenosis (AS) have worse outcome following surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) than patients with high-gradient AS. We hypothesized that transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) may be a better treatment option for these patients. The aim of this study was to compare outcomes of patients with LG AS referred for TAVR and SAVR. METHODS: We analysed clinical, echocardiographic and outcome data in 50 consecutive patients (age 81 ± 6 years, 50% females) with LG AS (aortic valve area ≤ 1 cm2, mean aortic valve pressure gradient <40 mmHg and peak aortic jet velocity < 4 m/s) who underwent TAVR, and compared them with 80 patients (age 76 ± 7 years, 35% females) who underwent SAVR. RESULTS: Over 4 years of follow-up there was no difference in survival free of stroke, long-term dialysis or urgent rehospitalization and overall survival between patients undergoing TAVR or SAVR (12% and 61% vs. 19% and 67%, p = 0.9 and 0.8, respectively), even though TAVR patients were significantly older, had more comorbidities and had a higher EuroSCORE II. After adjustment for these covariates, TAVR was associated with better event-free survival (adjusted HR: 0.63, 95% CI 0.40-0.97, p = 0.044). CONCLUSION: Patients with LG AS had better adjusted event-free survival when referred to TAVR rather than to SAVR. SUMMARY: Symptomatic patients with low-gradient severe aortic stenosis are at high risk for surgical aortic valve replacement. In this study, Transcatheter, as compared to surgical aortic valve replacement, was associated with better adjusted event free survival in patients with low gradient aortic stenosis.

The impact of pre-existing peripheral artery disease on transcatheter aortic valve implantation outcomes: A systematic review and meta-analysis.  ;"BACKGROUND: Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) plays a decisive role in the preinterventional selection process of the optimal vascular access site in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). However, the impact of PAD on mortality and vascular complications (VCs) in TAVI-treated patients remains unclear. Accordingly, we aimed to assess the outcomes of patients with and without PAD undergoing TAVI, by performing a meta-regression analysis. METHODS: Studies published between January 2002 and March 2018 and reporting outcomes according to the presence of PAD in TAVI patients were identified. Outcome measures analyzed were short-, mid- and long-term mortality, and peri-procedural VC. The interaction between sheath size and PAD on outcomes was also assessed. RESULTS: A total of 26 studies (68,581 TAVI patients, of whom 17,326 with preprocedural PAD) were included in the analysis. Patients with PAD had higher risk of mortality at short- (HR 1.36, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.13-1.63, p = .0009), mid- (HR 1.18, 95% CI 1.08-1.30, p = .0005), and long-term (HR 1.36, 95% CI 1.24-1.48, p < .0001) follow-up, and higher risk of VC (RR 1.55, 95% CI 1.27; 1.89, p < .0001). Moreover, the adoption of smaller sheaths during TAVI procedures was associated with fewer VC both in PAD and non-PAD patients, but the latter group had a more pronounced benefit. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with pre-existent PAD are at increased risk of all-cause mortality and VC after TAVI. The adoption of smaller sheaths during the procedure seems to be associated with fewer peri-procedural VC both in PAD and non-PAD patients.  "
Intravenous administration of cardiac progenitor cell-derived exosomes protects against doxorubicin/trastuzumab-induced cardiac toxicity.  ;"AIMS: Combined administration of anthracyclines (e.g. doxorubicin; Dox) and trastuzumab (Trz), a humanized anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2; ErbB2), is an effective treatment for HER2-positive breast cancer. However, both agents are associated with cardiac toxicity. Human cardiac-resident mesenchymal progenitor cells (CPCs) secrete extracellular vesicles including nanosized exosomes which protect against myocardial ischaemia. Here, we investigated the effects of these exosomes using a novel model of Dox/Trz-mediated cardiotoxicity. METHODS AND RESULTS: CPCs were derived from cardiac atrial appendage specimens from patients who underwent heart surgery for heart valve disease and/or ischaemic heart disease, and exosomes were purified from CPC conditioned media. Proteomics analyses revealed that CPC exosomes contained multiple proteins involved in redox processes. Dox/Trz induced a significant increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) in rat cardiomyocytes, which was prevented by CPC exosomes. In vivo, rats received six doses of Dox (Days 1-11), followed by six doses of Trz (Days 19-28). Three doses of either exosomes or exosome suspension vehicle were injected intravenously on Days 5, 11, and 19 in the treatment and control groups, respectively. Dox/Trz induced myocardial fibrosis, CD68+ inflammatory cell infiltrates, inducible nitric oxide synthase expression, and left ventricular dysfunction. CPC exosomes prevented these effects. These vesicles were highly enriched in miR-146a-5p compared with human dermal fibroblast exosomes. Dox upregulated Traf6 and Mpo, two known miR-146a-5p target genes (which encode signalling mediators of inflammatory and cell death axes) in myocytes. CPC exosomes suppressed miR-146a-5p target genes Traf6, Smad4, Irak1, Nox4, and Mpo in Dox-treated cells. Specific silencing of miR-146a-5p abrogated exosome-mediated suppression of those genes leading to an increase in Dox-induced cell death. CONCLUSIONS: Human CPC exosomes attenuate Dox-/Trz-induced oxidative stress in cardiomyocytes. Systemic administration of these vesicles prevents Dox/Trz cardiotoxicity in vivo. miR-146a-5p mediates some of the benefits of exosomes in this setting.  "

Left ventricular ejection hemodynamics before and after relief of outflow tract obstruction in patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy and valvular aortic stenosis.  ;OBJECTIVE: There has been debate on the importance and pathophysiologic effects of the dynamic subaortic pressure gradient in hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. The study was conducted to elucidate the hemodynamic abnormalities associated with the dynamic pressure gradient in hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. METHODS: Eight patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy and 7 patients with valvular aortic stenosis underwent a detailed hemodynamic study of pressure flow relationships before and after myectomy or aortic valve replacement during operation. RESULTS: In aortic stenosis, the increased gradient after premature ventricular contraction was associated with an increase in peak flow (325 ± 122 mL/s to 428 ± 147 mL/s, P = .002) and stroke volume (75.0 ± 27.3 mL to 88.0 ± 24.0 mL, P = .004), but in hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy peak flow remained unchanged (289 ± 79 mL/s to 299 ± 85 mL/s, P = .334) and stroke volume decreased (45.9 ± 18.7 mL to 38.4 ± 14.4 mL, P = .04) on the postpremature ventricular contraction beat. After myectomy, the capacity to augment stroke volume on the postpremature ventricular contraction beats was restored in patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (45.6 ± 14.4 mL to 54.4 ± 11.8 mL, P = .002). CONCLUSIONS: The pressure flow relationship in hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy supports the concept of true obstruction to outflow, with a low but continued flow during late systole, when the ventricular-aortic pressure gradient is the highest. Septal myectomy can abolish obstruction and restore the ability to augment stroke volume, which may explain the mechanism of symptomatic improvement after operation.

Transcatheter aortic valve-in-valve implantation for failed surgical bioprosthetic valves. A minimalist approach without contrast aortography or echocardiographic guidance.  ;OBJECTIVES: To demonstrate safety, feasibility and short-term clinical outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve-in-valve (ViV) implantation under local anesthesia without contrast aortography or echocardiographic guidance. BACKGROUND: Transcatheter ViV implantation is an emerging treatment modality for patients with degenerative surgical bioprostheses. Given the radiopaque properties of the surgical aortic valve (SAV) frame, ViV procedures can often be performed with fluoroscopic guidance alone. METHODS: ViV implantation was performed in 37 patients with SAV failure under local anesthesia without contrast aortography. Clinical and echocardiographic data were obtained at baseline, discharge, and 30 days. RESULTS: Mean age was 74 ± 10 years and STS predicted risk of mortality was 5.6 ± 2.4%. Mean transaortic gradient decreased from 39.4 ± 15.5 mmHg to 13 ± 6.3 mmHg at discharge (p < .001), and 20 ± 7.5 mmHg at 30 days (p < .001 compared to baseline), aortic valve area increased from 0.9 ± 0.3 cm2 to 1.2 ± 0.4 cm2 at 30 days (p = .007). No patient had more than mild aortic regurgitation. Hospital discharge occurred at a median of 2.6 ± 4.4 days. At 30-day follow-up there were no deaths, myocardial infarctions, strokes, repeat hospital admissions for heart failure, or renal failure. One patient (2.7%) required a new pacemaker. 93% of the patients were in New York Heart Association functional class I or II. CONCLUSIONS: Transcatheter aortic ViV implantation for selected patients with degenerative surgical bioprostheses under local anesthesia without aortography or echocardiographic guidance is feasible and safe.

Changes in Physical Performance and Their Association With Health-Related Quality of Life in a Mixed Nonischemic Cardiac Population That Participates in Rehabilitation.  ;PURPOSE: Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation improves physical performance and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). However, whether improvements in physical performance are associated with changes in HRQoL has not been adequately investigated in a nonischemic cardiac population. METHODS: Patients who were ablated for atrial fibrillation, who underwent heart valve surgery or who were treated for infective endocarditis, and who participated in 1 of 3 randomized controlled rehabilitation trials were eligible for the current study. Change in physical performance and HRQoL were measured before and after a 12-wk exercise intervention. Physical performance was assessed using a cardiopulmonary exercise test, a 6-min walk test, and a sit-to-stand test. Health-related quality of life was assessed using the generic 36-Item Short Form Health Survey and the disease-specific HeartQoL questionnaire. Spearman correlation coefficient (ρ) and linear regressions quantified the association between changes in physical outcome measures and changes in HRQoL. RESULTS: A total of 344 patients were included (mean age: 60.8 ± 11.6 yr and 77% males). Associations between changes in physical outcome measures and HRQoL ranged from very weak to weak (ρ = -0.056 to 0.228). The observed associations were more dominant within physical dimensions of the HRQoL compared with mental or emotional dimensions. After adjusting for sex, age, and diagnosis, changes in physical performance explained no more than 20% of the variation in the HRQoL. CONCLUSION: The findings show that the positive improvement in HRQoL from exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation cannot simply be explained by an improvement in physical performance.

Impact of COPD on outcomes in hospitalized patients treated with transcatheter aortic valve implantation or surgical aortic valve replacement in Spain.  ;"OBJECTIVES: To describe the use of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) and conventional surgery (SAVR) among hospitalized patients with and without COPD, to compare the in-hospital mortality (IHM), length of hospital stay (LOHS) and cost between patients with COPD undergoing TAVI and SAVR and to identify factors associated to IHM among these patients. BACKGROUND: TAVI would be expected to be less invasive and safer than SAVR among COPD patients. METHODS: We analyzed patients whose medical procedures included TAVI and SAVR included in the Spanish National Hospital Discharge Database, 2014-2015. We stratified analysis by COPD status. Propensity score matching (1:2) was performed to assess the outcomes of TAVI vs. SAVR among COPD patients. RESULTS: We identified 2,141 and 16,013 patients who underwent TAVI (27.60% with COPD) and SAVR (19.31% with COPD) respectively. For TAVI, we found no differences in IHM according to COPD status. Patients undergoing SAVR and suffering COPD had higher IHM than patients without COPD (adj.OR 1.32; 95%CI 1.10-1.58). After propensity score matching, IHM (8.35% vs. 5.83%, p = .040) and LOHS (18.62 days vs. 13.62; p < .001) were higher in COPD patients who underwent SAVR than those who underwent TAVI. CONCLUSIONS: COPD patients undergoing TAVI did not have a worse prognosis compared to non-COPD patients during hospitalization. However, for SAVR, patients with COPD had significantly higher mortality than patients without this condition. COPD patients who underwent SAVR had higher IHM and LOHS than propensity score matched TAVI patients.  "
VitaFlow™ transcatheter valve system in the treatment of severe aortic stenosis: One-year results of a multicenter study.  ;"OBJECTIVE: This study reports the 1-year clinical outcomes of the VitaFlow™ transcatheter aortic valve system in the treatment of severe aortic stenosis. BACKGROUND: The VitaFlow™ system (MicroPort®, Shanghai, China) was developed as a novel transcatheter aortic valve replacement system to mitigate or circumvent some of the challenges associated with heavily calcified valves and bicuspid valves. METHODS: From September 2014 to November 2017, a prospective, multicenter, single arm study was conducted in 11 centers in China. The primary end point was all cause mortality at 12 months. RESULTS: One hundred and ten symptomatic aortic stenosis patients (60 men, 50 women; mean age 77.73 ± 4.78 years) at prohibitive or high risk for surgery were enrolled. Mean society of thoracic surgeons score was 8.84 ± 5.58%. All-cause mortality was 2.7% at 1-year. Major stroke, major vascular complication, coronary artery obstruction, new pacemaker implantation occurred in 2.7, 2.7, 1.8, and 19.1% at 1-year follow-up, respectively. No patients had moderate or severe paravalvular leak at 1-year. At 1 year follow-up, 97% of patients had New York heart association ≤II. Patients with bicuspid valves had similar outcomes as those patients with tricuspid aortic valve stenosis. CONCLUSIONS: The 12-month clinical results support the safety and efficacy of VitaFlow™ in the treatment of patients with severe aortic stenosis, including patients with bicuspid aortic valve.  "
"Hydrogen sulfide inhibits calcification of heart valves; implications for calcific aortic valve disease.  ";BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Calcification of heart valves is a frequent pathological finding in chronic kidney disease and in elderly patients. Hydrogen sulfide (H2 S) may exert anti-calcific actions. Here we investigated H2 S as an inhibitor of valvular calcification and to identify its targets in the pathogenesis. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Effects of H2 S on osteoblastic transdifferentiation of valvular interstitial cells (VIC) isolated from samples of human aortic valves were studied using immunohistochemistry and western blots. We also assessed H2S on valvular calcification in apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE-/- ) mice. KEY RESULTS: In human VIC, H2 S from donor compounds (NaSH, Na2 S, GYY4137, AP67, and AP72) inhibited mineralization/osteoblastic transdifferentiation, dose-dependently in response to phosphate. Accumulation of calcium in the extracellular matrix and expression of osteocalcin and alkaline phosphatase was also inhibited. RUNX2 was not translocated to the nucleus and phosphate uptake was decreased. Pyrophosphate generation was increased via up-regulating ENPP2 and ANK1. Lowering endogenous production of H2 S by concomitant silencing of cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE) and cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) favoured VIC calcification. analysis of human specimens revealed higher Expression of CSE in aorta stenosis valves with calcification (AS) was higher than in valves of aortic insufficiency (AI). In contrast, tissue H2 S generation was lower in AS valves compared to AI valves. Valvular calcification in ApoE-/- mice on a high-fat diet was inhibited by H2 S. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The endogenous CSE-CBS/H2 S system exerts anti-calcification effects in heart valves providing a novel therapeutic approach to prevent hardening of valves.

A prospective survey of the persistence of warfarin or NOAC in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation: a COmparison study of Drugs for symptom control and complication prEvention of Atrial Fibrillation (CODE-AF).  ;"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Efforts to reduce stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) have focused on increasing physician adherence to oral anticoagulant (OAC) guidelines; however, the high early discontinuation rate of vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) is a limitation. Although non-VKA OACs (NOACs) are more convenient to administer than warfarin, their lack of monitoring may predispose patients to nonpersistence. We compared the persistence of NOAC and VKA treatment for AF in real-world practice. METHODS: In a prospective observational registry (COmparison study of Drugs for symptom control and complication prEvention of Atrial Fibrillation [CODE-AF] registry), 7,013 patients with nonvalvular AF (mean age 67.2 ± 10.9 years, women 36.4%) were consecutively enrolled between June 2016 and June 2017 from 10 tertiary hospitals in Korea. This study included 3,381 patients who started OAC 30 days before enrollment (maintenance group) and 572 patients who newly started OAC (new-starter group). The persistence rate of OAC was evaluated. RESULTS: In the maintenance group, persistence to OAC declined during 6 months, to 88.3% for VKA and 95.5% for NOAC (p < 0.0001). However, the persistence rate was not different among NOACs. In the new-starter group, persistence to OAC declined during 6 months, to 78.9% for VKA and 92.1% for NOAC (p < 0.0001). The persistence rate was lower for rivaroxaban (83.7%) than apixaban (94.6%) and edoxaban (94.1%, p < 0.001). In the new-starter group, diabetes, valve disease, and cancer were related to nonpersistence of OAC. CONCLUSION: Nonpersistence was significantly lower with NOAC than VKA in both the maintenance and new-starter groups. In only the new-starter group, apixaban or edoxaban showed higher persistence rates than rivaroxaban.  "
Modified implantation height of the Sapien3™ transcatheter heart valve.  ;"Objectives: During transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), ideal positioning is crucial. The latest-generation balloon expandable Sapien3™ transcatheter heart valve (THV) comes with a marker, which is recommended to be exactly centered at the aortic annular level. We aimed to evaluate a higher ""aortic"" marker positioning.Material and methods: A total of 119 high-risk patients presenting with aortic stenosis were treated with the Sapien3™ THV. After having placed the THV more ""aortic"", clinical and hemodynamic data, especially postoperative pacemaker implantation and paravalvular leakages, were evaluated at 30-days according to VARC-2.Results: The Sapien3™ THV was implanted in 92 patients via the transapical, in 13 patients via the transaortic and in 14 patients via the tranfemoral access. Mean age was 80.6 ± 5.7 years. Aortic valve area increased significantly (0.9 ± 0.3 vs. 1.80 ± 0.35cm2, p < .0001) and mean pressure gradients decreased from 41.0 ± 15.0 to 10.4 ± 3.5 mmHg (p < .0001). The majority of patients showed no or mild paravalvular aortic regurgitation (99.1%, 112/113), confirmed by transthoracic echocardiography at 30-days: PVL was absent or trace in 91.2% (103/113), mild in 7.9% (9/113) and moderate in 0.9% (1/113), whereas no patient developed severe PVL. Thirty days mortality was 5.0% (6/119). All patients (n = 113) were in NYHA functional class I or II at 30 days and three patients (2.5%) needed pacemaker implantation.Conclusions: In conclusion, a modified higher ""aortic"" implantation of the Sapien3™ THV holds promise to further reduce paravalvular leakage as well as permanent pacemaker implantation in TAVI. This trial showed an extremely low postoperative pacemaker implantation rate of 2.5%.  "

Impact of pretransplant mitral annular calcification on the incidence of cardiac events after renal transplantation.  ;"BACKGROUND: Mitral annular calcification (MAC) is associated with increased risk of major adverse cardiac events. We hypothesized that MAC, identified on a pretransplant transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), is predictive of cardiac events following renal transplantation (RT). METHODS: In a retrospective cohort of consecutive RT recipients, pretransplant MAC presence and severity were determined on TTE performed within 1 year prior to transplant. MAC severity was quantified based on the circumferential MAC extension relative to the mitral valve annulus. Post-transplant cardiac risk was assessed using the sum of risk factors (range: 0-8) set forth by the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology Foundation consensus statement on the assessment of RT candidates. Subjects underwent pretransplant stress single-photon emission computed tomography myocardial perfusion imaging and followed for post-transplant composite outcome of cardiac death or myocardial infarction (CD/MI). RESULTS: Among 336 subjects (60.5% men; mean age 52 ± 12 years), MAC was present in 78 (23%) patients. During a mean follow-up of 3.1 ± 1.9 years, a total of 70 events were observed. Patients with MAC had a higher event rate compared with those without MAC (34.6% versus 17.8%, log-rank P = 0.001). There was a stepwise increase in CD/MI risk with increasing MAC severity (P for trend = 0.002). MAC-associated risk remained significant after adjusting for sex, duration of dialysis, sum of risk factors, ejection fraction and perfusion abnormality burden, providing an incremental prognostic value to these parameters (Δχ2 =4.63; P = 0.031). CONCLUSION: Among RT recipients, the burden of pretransplant MAC is an independent predictor of post-transplant risk of CD/MI. MAC should be considered in the preoperative assessment of RT candidates.  "

Infective Endocarditis in the Intravenous Drug Use Population at a Tertiary Hospital in Melbourne, Australia.  ;"BACKGROUND: Infective endocarditis has been associated with underlying cardiac pathology and streptococci infections. Intravenous drug use (IVDU) is increasingly implicated as a contributing factor, resulting in a shift to a younger patient demographic, tricuspid valve involvement, severe staphylococcal infection, and unique management challenges. The objective of this study was to describe the clinical features, management and outcomes of patients with IVDU-associated infective endocarditis in the Australian context. METHODS: A retrospective review of all episodes of IVDU-associated infective endocarditis at a tertiary hospital in Melbourne, Australia, from 2008 to 2015, was conducted. Included cases met Duke Criteria for 'definite' or 'possible' infective endocarditis, and had a history of IVDU within 3 months of presentation. Demographic data, substance use history, clinical features, surgical intervention, follow-up, and mortality data was collected. We explored factors associated with surgical intervention, recurrence and mortality. RESULTS: Fifty-five (55) episodes of IVDU-associated infective endocarditis were identified in 46 patients; the median age was 40 years and 58% were male. The tricuspid valve was most commonly affected (38%), and left heart pathology was documented in 53% of cases. Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus was the most common pathogen (67%). Thirty-six (36%) per cent of patients underwent surgical intervention, and all patients received antibiotics as a component of treatment, with a median duration of 42 days (IQR 21, 42 days). Heart failure and a vegetation larger than 1 cm were significantly associated with surgical intervention. Total mortality was 14.5%; surgical mortality was 10%. Opioid replacement therapy and the absence of psychiatric co-morbidities were protective factors for surgical intervention and disease recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to common perception, left-sided endocarditis was more common than tricuspid valve endocarditis. Left heart pathology is typically a more severe clinical entity, however, our study determined mortality rates remained similar when compared to right heart pathology. Further research is required to assess rates of left sided disease in the IVDU population, and elucidate the relationship between IVDU and left heart pathology.  "
The Role of 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography in the Diagnosis of Left-sided Endocarditis: Native vs Prosthetic Valves Endocarditis.  ;"BACKGROUND: 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18F-FDG-PET/CT) has emerged as a useful diagnostic tool for suspected infective endocarditis (IE) in patients with prosthetic valves or implantable devices. However, there is limited evidence regarding use of 18F-FDG-PET/CT for the diagnosis of native valve endocarditis (NVE). METHODS: Between 2014 and 2017, 303 episodes of left-sided suspected IE (188 prosthetic valves/ascending aortic prosthesis and 115 native valves) were studied. 18F-FDG-PET/CT accuracy was determined in the subgroups of patients with NVE and prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE)/ascending aortic prosthesis infection (AAPI). Associations between inflammatory infiltrate patterns and 18F-FDG-PET/CT uptake were investigated in an exploratory ad hoc histological analysis. RESULTS: Among 188 patients with PVE/AAPI, the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of 18F-FDG-PET/CT focal uptake were 93%, 90%, 89%, and 94%, respectively, while among 115 patients with NVE, the corresponding values were 22%, 100%, 100%, and 66%. The inclusion of abnormal 18F-FDG cardiac uptake as a major criterion at admission enabled a recategorization of 76% (47/62) of PVE/AAPI cases initially classified as ""possible"" to ""definite"" IE. In the histopathological analysis, a predominance of polymorphonuclear cell inflammatory infiltrate and a reduced extent of fibrosis were observed in the PVE group only. CONCLUSIONS: Use of 18F-FDG-PET/CT at the initial presentation of patients with suspected PVE increases the diagnostic capability of the modified Duke criteria. In patients who present with suspected NVE, the use of 18F-FDG-PET/CT is less accurate and could only be considered a complementary diagnostic tool for a specific population of patients with NVE.  "
"Characteristics and Outcomes of Patients With Severe Aortic Stenosis Discussed by the Multidisciplinary ""Heart Team"" According to Treatment Allocation.  ";"BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is an alternative and effective contemporary intervention to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) for patients with severe aortic valve disease at increased surgical risk. Guidelines recommend a multidisciplinary ""Heart Team"" (MHT) review of patients considered for a TAVI procedure, but this has been little studied. We reviewed the characteristics, treatments and outcomes of such patients reviewed by the MHT at our centre. METHODS: Data on consecutive patients with severe aortic valve stenosis discussed by the Auckland City Hospital MHT from June 2011 to August 2016 were obtained from clinical records. Patient characteristics, treatment and outcomes were analysed using standard statistical methods. RESULTS: Over the 5-year period 243 patients (mean age 80.2 ± 8.0 years, 60% male) were presented at the MHT meeting. TAVI was recommended for 200, SAVR for 26 and medical therapy for 17 patients, with no significant difference in mean age (80.2 ± 8.3, 80.4 ± 6.1, 80.4 ± 7.3 years, respectively) or EuroSCORE II (6.5 ± 4.7%, 5.3 ± 3.6%, 6.7 ± 4.3%, respectively). Over time, there was an increase in the number of patients discussed and treated, with no change in their mean age, but the mean EuroSCORE II significantly decreased (TAVI p = 0.026, SAVR p = 0.004). Survival after TAVI and SAVR was similar to that of the age-matched general population, but superior to medical therapy p = 0.002 (93% (n = 162), 84% (n = 21) and 73% (n = 18) at one year and 85% (n = 149), 84% (n = 21) and 54% (n = 13) at 2 years, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: An increasing number of patients were discussed at the MHT meeting with the majority undergoing TAVI, with a similar age and EuroSCORE II to those allocated SAVR or medical therapy. Survival following TAVI and SAVR was superior to medical therapy and similar to the age-matched general population. These findings suggest that the MHT process is robust, consistent and appropriately allocating a limited treatment resource.  "
Mitral valve replacement and trans-mitral myectomy for a child with Noonan syndrome accompanied by hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy.  ;A 4-year-old boy with Noonan syndrome accompanied by hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy presented with refractory heart failure owing to severe left ventricular outflow obstruction and mitral regurgitation. He underwent mitral valve replacement and trans-mitral myectomy. The pathology of the resected myocardium was consistent with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and the mitral valve leaflets were severely degenerated. Compared with a control patient who is a non-syndromic 4-year-old boy with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, mitral pathology was much more severe in Noonan syndrome. Regarding trans-mitral myectomy, residual pressure gradient at the mid-ventricular level made us think about more aggressive muscle resection with various approaches.

Outcomes of Patients after Implantation of the Pericardial All-Biological Valve No-React Aortic Conduit (BioIntegral) for Root Replacement in Complex Surgical Procedures.  ;"OBJECTIVE: Therapy of complex aortic root pathologies remains a great surgical challenge. Though different graft materials are available to replace the often-destroyed aortic root, long durability and freedom from reoperation of the latter are still under debate. The aim of our study was to investigate patients' postoperative outcome after implantation of the BioIntegral conduit in complex aortic root pathologies. METHODS: From February 2014 to May 2017, 33 consecutive patients (69.7% male) with a median age of 73 (57.5; 76.2) years underwent aortic root replacement with the BioIntegral conduit at our institution. Severe aortic valve endocarditis (78.8%) was the predominant indication for surgery. In 28 patients (84.9%), implantation was performed as redo or in 87.8% as urgent and emergent surgery. Primary end-point was the 30-day survival time, evaluated by Cox regression analysis. Secondary midterm outcome and graft-related reoperation were analyzed. RESULTS: Median follow-up for all patients was 178 (8; 659) days. Median EuroScore II was 19.9% (13.4; 29.9). Freedom from reoperation was 97%. The overall 30-day mortality rate was 33% mainly caused by multiorgan failure in six (18.2%) patients and cardiac failure in five (15.1%) patients. One further death occurred during follow-up at day 156. None was directly conduit-related. Graft reinfection after the 4th surgery with basal abscess formation occurred in only one patient (3%). Early echocardiographic assessment of the valve revealed good functional results. A higher EuroScore II was significantly associated with a poorer 30-day survival time (hazard ratio, 1.039; 95% confidence interval, 1.015-1.063, p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Aortic root replacement for complex pathologies is associated with substantial 30-day mortality, but survival of patients after discharge from hospital was stable. Early functional status of the BioIntegral valve was good. Though freedom from re-operation was low, long-term outcome and long-term functional status have to be further evaluated.  "
Successful repositioning of apically tethered transcatheter mitral valve replacement in the off-bypass, beating heart.  ;A 73-year-old man with severe, symptomatic secondary mitral regurgitation (MR) underwent successful transcatheter mitral valve replacement using the Tendyne™ mitral valve system. The device was deployed from the left ventricular (LV) apex and secured in position by a tether attached to an epicardial pad. Three days postoperatively, the patient developed hemolytic anemia and a paravalvular leak (PVL) associated with indentation of the LV apex. Adjustment of the tether tension and placement of an epicardial disc under the pad resulted in reduction in the PVL, and resolution of the hemolytic anemia.

Outcome for surgical treatment of infective endocarditis with periannular abscess.  ;"BACKGROUND: Surgical treatment of infective endocarditis (IE) with aortic periannular abscess (PA) is a challenging issue with high mortality and morbidity rate in the current era. The present study is to review the results of surgical treatment for IE-PA based on an anatomy-guided surgical procedure selection for either aortic valve replacement (AVR) or aortic root reconstruction (ARR). METHODS: Patients with IE-PA received surgical treatment in National Taiwan University Hospital during the years 2001-2017 were retrospectively reviewed. The selection of surgical procedure was based on the intraoperative anatomical finding. The AVR group consisted of isolated AVR or AVR with patch repair if PA involved less than one cusp of the annulus. The ARR group included aortic root replacement if PA involved more than one cusp, causing commissural/sub-commissural destruction. In-hospital mortality and mid-term outcome and the risk factors were examined. RESULTS: In-hospital mortality was 13% in the AVR group (24 patients) and 25% in the ARR group (8 patients) (p = 0.578). The composite adverse events (cardiac death, valve reoperation, or paravalvular leak) rate was 31% in the AVR group and 40% in the ARR group at one year; 48% in the AVR group and 40% in the ARR group at five years; 55% in the AVR group and 40% in the ARR group at ten years. CONCLUSION: Anatomy-guided surgical procedure selection for IE-PA is feasible. With the appropriate selection, ARR may be associated with fewer adverse events in mid-term follow-up. Careful intraoperative judgment and management and long-term follow-up are warranted for these patients.  "

Thrombectomy and reconstruction of the left vertebral artery after total arch replacement: never give up on postoperative stroke.  ;The patient was a 64-year-old man who had aortic regurgitation, ischemic heart disease, a transverse aortic aneurysm, and an abdominal-common iliac aneurysm. Concomitant operations including aortic valve replacement, coronary artery bypass grafting, and total aortic arch replacement with elephant trunk technique were performed successfully. The patient developed postoperative cardiac tamponade on the 5th postoperative day, resulting in bulbar palsy due to occlusion of the dominant left vertebral artery. Thrombectomy of the vertebral artery with reconstruction by a saphenous vein was performed. The patient's neurological symptoms improved after the operation. Revascularization of ischemic stroke may yield neurological improvement even in patients after cardiovascular surgery.

In Vitro Durability and Stability Testing of a Novel Polymeric Transcatheter Aortic Valve.  ;"Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has emerged as an effective therapy for the unmet clinical need of inoperable patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS). Current clinically used tissue TAVR valves suffer from limited durability that hampers TAVR's rapid expansion to younger, lower risk patients. Polymeric TAVR valves optimized for hemodynamic performance, hemocompatibility, extended durability, and resistance to calcific degeneration offer a viable solution to this challenge. We present extensive in vitro durability and stability testing of a novel polymeric TAVR valve (PolyNova valve) using 1) accelerated wear testing (AWT, ISO 5840); 2) calcification susceptibility (in the AWT)-compared with clinically used tissue valves; and 3) extended crimping stability (valves crimped to 16 Fr for 8 days). Hydrodynamic testing was performed every 50M cycles. The valves were also evaluated visually for structural integrity and by scanning electron microscopy for evaluation of surface damage in the micro-scale. Calcium and phosphorus deposition was evaluated using micro-computed tomography (μCT) and inductive coupled plasma spectroscopy. The valves passed 400M cycles in the AWT without failure. The effective orifice area kept stable at 1.8 cm with a desired gradual decrease in transvalvular pressure gradient and regurgitation (10.4 mm Hg and 6.9%, respectively). Calcium and phosphorus deposition was significantly lower in the polymeric valve: down by a factor of 85 and 16, respectively-as compared to a tissue valve. Following the extended crimping testing, no tears nor surface damage were evident. The results of this study demonstrate the potential of a polymeric TAVR valve to be a viable alternative to tissue-based TAVR valves.  "
Outcomes of Evolut R Versus CoreValve After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation: A Meta-Analysis.  ;BACKGROUND: Superiority of the new-generation, self-expanding Evolut R compared with the first-generation CoreValve on outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is unclear. This meta-analysis sought to investigate the outcomes of Evolut R vs CoreValve after TAVI. METHODS: A systematic review of studies comparing outcomes of Evolut R and CoreValve after TAVI was performed through PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Library. Crude risk ratios (RRs) were calculated with 95% confidence intervals using a random effects model. Outcomes of interest were mortality, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA), severe bleeding, acute kidney injury (AKI), major vascular complications (MVC), permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI), moderate or severe paravalvular regurgitation (PVR), and device failure. RESULTS: Six studies involving 11,530 patients (4,597 receiving Evolut R and 6,933 receiving CoreValve) were included. There was no significant difference in 30-day all-cause mortality between Evolut R and CoreValve (3.4% vs 5.0%, p = 0.10). The incidence of MI (0.2% vs 0.5%, p = 0.02), AKI (6.0% vs 9.2%, p = 0.001), moderate or severe PVR (6.4% vs 8.0%, p = 0.04), and device failure (3.5% vs 5.2%, p = 0.04) were significantly lower in Evolut R than CoreValve. There were trends toward less severe bleeding (7.2% vs 8.8%, p = 0.05) and PPI (18.6% vs 20.8%, p = 0.05) in Evolut R. The rates of stroke or TIA and MVC were similar between the two prostheses. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with CoreValve, Evolut R did not reduce 30-day all-cause mortality, but significantly improved periprocedural complications after TAVI.

Ayurvedic approach to treat Hridroga (valvular heart disease): A case report.  ;Kabhatika Hridroga (valvular heart disease) embodies a significant part of cardiovascular disease. There are many causes for valvular heart disease of which, the rheumatic fever is an important one. This study is a case report of a patient awaiting mitral valve transplant for valvular heart disease (i.e., mitral stenosis attributed to rheumatic fever), who responded well to Ayurvedic management. After 11 months of treatment, 3D cardiovascular cartography showed increase in mitral valve area from 1.3 sq cm to 3.52 sq cm (normal size is 4-6 sq cm). The present case report showed that Ayurveda has a great potential for the treatment of valvular heart disease and merits further research.  
Transcatheter tricuspid valve-in-valve replacement: Making it simpler.  ;"Transcatheter tricuspid valve-in-valve replacement (TTVR) represents an attractive therapeutic option in very high surgical risk patients with degenerated tricuspid bioprostheses. However, the procedural management of these patients might be challenging due to their comorbidities, long lasting heart valve disease and the presence of left-sided mechanical prostheses. Thus, a more ""minimally disruptive"" procedure would have several potential benefits in such a frail population. We present the cases of four patients admitted for congestive heart failure due to severe degeneration of their tricuspid bioprostheses who were treated with a minimalist TTVR. The protocol combined continuation of the oral anticoagulant treatment with no bridging therapy, the use of a single venous access with local anesthesia, rapid pacing via the stiff right ventricular wire, and transthoracic echocardiographic guidance and assessment, with no need for contrast injection. Our protocol aims at simplifying the TTVR procedure and might be a useful tool to avoid procedural complications and reduce hospital stay.  "

Cardiopulmonary Exercise Test Parameters at Three Months After Alcohol Septal Ablation in Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy Are Associated With Late Clinical Outcome.  ;BACKGROUND: Alcohol septal ablation (ASA) is an established interventional treatment for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) patients with drug refractory symptoms. This study investigated the prognostic value of cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) in relation to the late clinical outcome. METHODS: Twenty-one (21) HOCM patients underwent CPET before and 3 months after ASA and were followed yearly thereafter. Clinical success was considered to be a decrease of ≥1 (New York Heart Association or Canadian Cardiovascular Society) functional class. Cardiopulmonary exercise test parameters [maximal oxygen uptake (PeakVO2), % predicted VO2 (PeakVO2%), oxygen uptake at anaerobic threshold (AT), maximal workload (W), % predicted W (W%), ventilation (VE), % predicted VE (VE%), ventilation to maximal carbon dioxide production slope (VE/VCO2), % predicted maximal heart rate (HR%), and maximal systolic blood pressure (SBP)] were compared before and 3 months after ASA. RESULTS: After follow-up of 29 ± 13 months, 16 patients had a good clinical results (clinical responders), while five did not improve (clinical non-responders). The CPET parameters did not change in non-responders, while clinical responders showed significant improvement in VO2, VO2%, W, VE/VCO2, VE, VE%, as well as an increase in HR% and SBP at 3 months. CONCLUSIONS: The data confirmed a good association between the improvement in CPET parameters and the clinical results 3 months after ASA. This may therefore serve as an early marker of HOCM-ASA treatment success.

Extending the positive bias in Williams syndrome: The influence of biographical information on attention allocation.  ;"There is evidence that individuals with Williams syndrome (WS) show an attention bias toward positive social-perceptual (happy) faces. Research has not yet considered whether this attention bias extends beyond social-perceptual stimuli to perceptually neutral stimuli that are paired with positive (trustworthy) biographical information. Fourteen participants with WS (mean age = 21 years, 1 month) learned to associate perceptually neutral faces with trustworthy (positive), neutral, or untrustworthy (negative) biographical information, before completing a dot-probe task where the same biographical faces were presented. The performance of the WS group was compared to two typically developing control groups, individually matched to the WS individuals on chronological age and mental age, respectively. No between-group bias toward untrustworthy characters was observed. The WS group displayed a selective attention bias toward trustworthy characters compared to both control groups (who did not show such a bias). Results support previous findings that indicate WS individuals show a preference for positive social-perceptual stimuli (happy faces) at the neurological, physiological, and attentional levels. The current findings extend this work to include a ""top-down"" positive bias. The implications of a positive bias that extends beyond social-perceptual stimuli (or ""bottom-up"" processes) in this syndrome are discussed.  "
Use of left atrial appendage occlusion among older cardiac surgery patients with preoperative atrial fibrillation: a national cohort study.  ;"PURPOSE: Patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) undergoing cardiac surgery are at substantially increased risk for stroke. Increasing evidence has suggested that surgical left atrial appendage occlusion (S-LAAO) may have the potential to substantially mitigate this stroke risk; however, S-LAAO is performed in a minority of patients with AF undergoing cardiac surgery. We sought to identify factors associated with usage of S-LAAO. METHODS: In a nationally-representative, contemporary cohort (07/2011-06/2012) of older patients undergoing cardiac surgery with preoperative AF (n = 11,404) from the Medicare-linked Society of Thoracic Surgeons Adult Cardiac Surgery Database, we evaluated patient and hospital characteristics associated with S-LAAO use by employing logistic and linear regression models. RESULTS: In this cohort (average age, 76 years; 39% female), 4177 (37%) underwent S-LAAO. Neither S-LAAO nor discharge anticoagulation was used in 25% (""unprotected"" patients). The overall propensity for S-LAAO decreased significantly with increasing CHA2DS2-VASc (congestive heart failure; hypertension; age 75 years or older; diabetes mellitus; stroke, transient ischemic attack, or thromboembolism; vascular disease; age 65 to 74 years; sex category (female)) score (ptrend < 0.001). There was substantial variability in S-LAAO use across geographic regions, and S-LAAO was more commonly performed at academic and higher-volume valve surgery centers. CONCLUSIONS: Substantial variability in use of S-LAAO exists. In many instances, the procedure is being deferred in the patients that may be poised to benefit the most (i.e., those with increased CHA2DS2-VASc score-defined stroke risk).  "
Sacubitril/Valsartan in Adult Congenital Heart Disease Patients With Chronic Heart Failure - A Single Centre Case Series and Call for an International Registry.  ;BACKGROUND: An improvement in life expectancy in patients suffering from adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) has corresponded with a rise in heart failure incidence within this group. An area that has not been addressed in ACHD heart failure guidelines has been the use of combined inhibition of angiotensin receptor-neprolysin pathways. This case series sought to demonstrate tolerability and 6-month outcome measures of sacubitril/valsartan use in ACHD patients with a severely impaired systemic ventricle. METHODS: A prospective cohort analysis of ACHD patients between December 2016 and September 2017 with severe systemic ventricular systolic dysfunction, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II-III symptoms and eligible for commencement on a sacubitril/valsartan regime was undertaken. RESULTS: Five (5) consecutive patients were included in this cohort review, 80% male, mean age 41.8 (±19) years and mean systemic ventricular ejection fraction 27% (±3.6%). Two (2) patients with pre-existing D-TGA and atrial baffle repair, one patient with Tetralogy of Fallot repair and pulmonary valve replacement (PVR), one patient with left atrial isomerism and partial atrioventricular (AV) canal defect repair and mitral valve replacement (MVR) and the last patient had biventricular repair for pulmonary atresia with MVR and PVR. Forty per cent (40%) of patients had a systemic right ventricle. All patients had NYHA functional class of ≥II, were on optimal tolerated doses ACE-I or ARB prior to sacubitril/valsartan combination. Six (6) months post commencement of sacubitril/valsartan patients experienced a mean improvement of one functional class. CONCLUSIONS: Our experience suggests that sacubitril/valsartan therapy is well tolerated in ACHD heart failure patients and is associated with improvement in functional class.  
Aortic Root Enlargement and Aortic Valve Replacement for Calcified Supravalvular and Valvular Aortic Stenosis in Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia: A Case Report.  ;Familial homozygous hypercholesterolemia is a rare disease with diverse clinical presentations ranging from premature ischemic heart disease to aortic root stenosis but rarely presents with anginal symptoms due to supravalvular and valvular aortic stenosis. We report a 19-year-old male patient with familial homozygous hypercholesterolemia with progressive supravalvular and valvular aortic stenosis that ultimately required aortic root enlargement and aortic valve replacement using a mechanical prosthesis, despite aggressive medical therapy. Surgical importance of this rare condition is highlighted.  
Clinical Short-Term Outcome and Hemodynamic Comparison of Six Contemporary Bovine Aortic Valve Prostheses.  ;BACKGROUND:  Conventional stented valves (CV) remain gold standard for aortic valve disease. Bovine prostheses have been improved and rapid deployment valves (RDV) have arrived in the recent decade. We compare clinical and hemodynamic short-term outcome of six bovine valves. METHODS:  We retrospectively evaluated 829 consecutive patients (all-comers) receiving bovine aortic valve replacement (AVR). Four CV from different manufacturers (Mitroflow, Crown, Perimount, Trifecta) and two RDV (Perceval, Intuity) were compared in terms of pre-, intra-, and postprocedural data. A risk model for mortality was created. RESULTS:  All valves reduced gradients. From 23 mm, all CV showed acceptable gradients. Twenty-one millimeter Mitroflow/Perceval and 19 mm Crown showed above-average gradients. As baseline data differed, we performed propensity matching between aggregated isolated CV and RDV groups. Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), clamp, and surgery times were shorter with RDV (87.4 ± 34.0 min vs 111.0 ± 34.2, 54.3 ± 21.1 vs 74.9 ± 20.4, 155.2 ± 42.9 vs 178.0 ± 46.8, p < 0.001). New pacemaker rate (10.1 vs 1.3%, p = 0.016) and the tendency toward neurologic events (8.9 vs 2.5%, p = 0.086) were higher using RDV, induced mainly by the Perceval. Early mortality was equal (2.5 vs 1.3%, p = 0.560). Revision for bleeding, dialysis, blood products, length-of-stay, gradients, and regurgitation was also equal. Risk analysis showed that low valve size, low ejection fraction, endocarditis, administration of red cells, and prolonged CPB time were predictors of elevated mortality. CONCLUSION:  Isolated bovine AVR has low mortality. Valves ≥ 23 mm show comparable gradients while the valve model matters < 23 mm. RDV should be used with care. Procedure-related times are shorter than those of CV but pacemaker implantation and neurologic events are more frequent (Perceval). Early mortality is low and valve performance comparable to CV.  
Hammock Mitral Valve Repair in Infancy: Operative Steps Toward a Customized Reconstruction After Preoperative Planning.  ;Hammock mitral valve (MV) repair is historically technically difficult with a guarded prognosis. Surgical experience is extremely limited and variable outcomes are reported. The perioperative strategy and technical details of hammock MV repair in an infant who presented with severe mitral stenosis are described and review of the existing literature was undertaken.  
Previous coronary artery bypass graft is not associated with higher mortality in transcatheter aortic valve replacement: systemic review and meta-analysis.  ;Introduction: Patients with previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) are usually considered as high-risk groups perioperatively. Recent studies suggest that previous CABG is not associated with mortality in patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) who underwent transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). However, systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature has not been done. Thus, we conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the association between previous CABG and mortality in patients undergoing TAVR.Methods: We comprehensively searched the databases of MEDLINE and EMBASE from inception to July 2018. Included studies were published prospective or retrospective cohort studies that evaluated the effects of previous CABG status on mortality risk among patients undergoing TAVR. Data from each study were combined using the random-effects, generic inverse variance method of DerSimonian and Laird to calculate risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals.Results: Eleven cohort studies from March 2010 to April 2018 were included in this meta-analysis involving 7299 subjects with severe AS undergoing TAVR (1890 with and 5409 without previous CABG). Previous CABG was not associated with all-cause mortality (pooled risk ratio = 0.96, 95% confidence interval: 0.80-1.16, p=.66, I2=21%) and cardiovascular (CV) mortality (pooled risk ratio = 1.23, 95% confidence interval: 0.64-2.39, p=.72, I2=35%).Conclusions: Previous CABG is not associated with either all-cause mortality or CV mortality in patients with severe AS undergoing TAVR. TAVR should be considered as an alternative or first-line treatment option among severe AS patient, regardless of previous CABG status.  
Temporary oral anticoagulation after MitraClip - a strategy to lower the incidence of post-procedural stroke?  ;"Background: Incidence of stroke within 30 days after percutaneous mitral valve repair using the MitraClip varies from 0.7% and 2.6% between registries. Standard medical treatment after the MitraClip procedure, in the absence of risk factors requiring antithrombotic therapy such as atrial fibrillation, is dual antiplatelet therapy using aspirin and clopidogrel. ESC/EACTS and ACC/AHA surgical guidelines show a Class IIa indication for temporary antithrombotic therapy after mitral valve repair/bioprosthetic valve replacement within the first three months even in patients with no additional risk factors.Methods: 470 patients were treated with the MitraClip receiving oral anticoagulation (Coumadin: INR 2.0-3.0) instead of dual antiplatelet therapy for at least 30 days after the procedure. The incidence of stroke, as well as major adverse events such as bleeding, were analysed in comparison to large registries and multi-centre studies.Results: Incidence of stroke within 30 days was significantly reduced as compared to comparative cohorts (0.2% vs. Median 1.3% [0.7-2.6%]; p < .05). Cardiovascular risk factors such as age, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, diabetes, STS score and prior stroke did not differ significantly between cohorts (ns). Bleeding complications were not increased due to 30 days oral anticoagulation treatment (4.6% vs. Median 7.4% [3.4-13.6%]; ns).Conclusions: Temporary oral anticoagulation might be a strategy to reduce the incidence of stroke within the first 30 days after the MitraClip procedure. Bleeding events were not significantly altered due to temporary oral anticoagulation.  "

Fragmented QRS on electrocardiography as a predictor of myocardial scar in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  ;Background: Fragmented QRS (fQRS) and Q waves are ECG findings in patients with myocardial scar. fQRS is more sensitive than pathological Q waves in detecting myocardial fibrosis in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging is used for the diagnosis and for quantifying scar tissue in patients with HCM. Our aim was to correlate ECG parameters like fQRS and Q waves with the presence of late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) assessed by contrast CMR imaging to elucidate ECG markers which might predict scar tissue in HCM.Methods: This study is a retrospective analysis which included 39 patients who were diagnosed/suspected to have HCM on echocardiography and referred for contrast CMR imaging at our centre between 2010 and 2016. Presence of fQRS was correlated with scar demonstrated by LGE on CMR.Results: Twenty four (66.67%) patients had asymmetrical septal hypertrophy, 7 (19.44%) patients had apical involvement while 5 (13.89%) had concentric pattern. Only 4 (11.11%) patients had pathological Q waves in contiguous leads on surface ECG while fQRS in two contiguous leads was present in 23 (63.89%) patients. Presence of fQRS was more in patients with LGE on CMR than those without (84.61 versus 10%, p<.001). When presence of LGE in specific segments (anterior, lateral and inferior) was correlated with corresponding ECG leads, all the three segments showed significant correlation. The overall sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of fQRS for predicting scar tissue were 84.6, 90.0, 95.6 and 69.2%, respectively.Conclusion: fQRS on surface ECG can be used as an indirect marker to predict the presence of fibrosis in HCM.

A successful report of mitral valve repair for parachute-like mitral valve in adult.  ;A 65 year-old man was diagnosed with congestive heart failure secondary to severe mitral regurgitation resulting from a parachute-like asymmetrical mitral valve. We performed mitral annuloplasty and triangular resection of the thick tissue. The postoperative course was uneventful with no recurrence of mitral regurgitation.  
Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy and mitral regurgitation in Libman-Sacks endocarditis.  ;Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy in Libman-Sacks endocarditis is quite rare and the correct etiological relationship between them is unknown. Some changes may cause a secondary disorganization of the ordinary muscle structure, making a disarray pattern with irregular interwoven myocyte fibers. This case report describes one of the first cases of ventricular septal myectomy and mitral valve replacement for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy and mitral valve regurgitation associated with Libman-Sacks endocarditis.  
Outcome postponement as a potential patient centred measure of therapeutic benefit: examples in cardiovascular medicine.  ;Background: The impact of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) depends heavily on the presentation of the findings.Objective: Classically, RCT findings are presented in the form of absolute risk reduction (ARR), number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one adverse outcome, and relative risk reduction (RRR) or hazard ratio (the most favourable means for drug marketing). However, the estimation of average survival gain (i.e. outcome postponement between a trial intervention and comparator) is an alternative and informative means of presenting the findings of RCTs.Study selection: Recent cardiovascular RCTs evaluating ezetimibe added to simvastatin, evolocumab, canakinumab, ticagrelor, rivaroxaban, ivabradine, LCZ 696 (sacubitril/valsartan), and transfemoral aortic valve replacement are analysed and discussed.Findings: The average survival gains ranged between 4.9 days on a composite end point with ticagrelor versus clopidogrel in randomised patients with acute coronary syndrome and 117 days of life expectancy obtained with TAVR versus standard therapy in patients with severe aortic stenosis deemed ineligible for surgery.Conclusions: Using outcome postponement as an additional measure of treatment effect is likely to be more easily understood than hazard ratio or RRR by both patients and physicians and could help when evaluating drugs.  
Analytical quantification of aortic valve 18F-sodium fluoride PET uptake.  ;"BACKGROUND: Challenges to cardiac PET-CT include patient motion, prolonged image acquisition and a reduction of counts due to gating. We compared two analytical tools, FusionQuant and OsiriX, for quantification of gated cardiac 18F-sodium fluoride (18F-fluoride) PET-CT imaging. METHODS: Twenty-seven patients with aortic stenosis were included, 15 of whom underwent repeated imaging 4 weeks apart. Agreement between analytical tools and scan-rescan reproducibility was determined using the Bland-Altman method and Lin's concordance correlation coefficients (CCC). RESULTS: Image analysis was faster with FusionQuant [median time (IQR) 7:10 (6:40-8:20) minutes] compared with OsiriX [8:30 (8:00-10:10) minutes, p = .002]. Agreement of uptake measurements between programs was excellent, CCC = 0.972 (95% CI 0.949-0.995) for mean tissue-to-background ratio (TBRmean) and 0.981 (95% CI 0.965-0.997) for maximum tissue-to-background ratio (TBRmax). Mean noise decreased from 11.7% in the diastolic gate to 6.7% in motion-corrected images (p = .002); SNR increased from 25.41 to 41.13 (p = .0001). Aortic valve scan-rescan reproducibility for TBRmax was improved with FusionQuant using motion correction compared to OsiriX (error ± 36% vs ± 13%, p < .001) while reproducibility for TBRmean was similar (± 10% vs ± 8% p = .252). CONCLUSION: 18F-fluoride PET quantification with FusionQuant and OsiriX is comparable. FusionQuant with motion correction offers advantages with respect to analysis time and reproducibility of TBRmax values.  "

Sutureless versus Stented Bioprostheses for Aortic Valve Replacement: The Randomized PERSIST-AVR Study Design.  ;INTRODUCTION: Sutureless biological valves for surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR), characterized by the absence of anchoring sutures at the aortic annulus, are gaining popularity because of ease and reproducibility of implant, shorter operating times, and enhancement of minimally invasive approaches. The stentless configuration of the sutureless valve was designed to achieve optimal hemodynamic performance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PERSIST-AVR (PERceval Sutureless Implant versus STandard Aortic Valve Replacement) is a prospective, randomized, adaptive, open-label, international, postmarket trial (NCT02673697). The primary objective of the trial is to assess the safety and efficacy of the Perceval (LivaNova, London, UK) sutureless bioprosthesis among patients undergoing SAVR in the presence of severe aortic stenosis to demonstrate the noninferiority of Perceval as compared with standard sutured stented bioprosthetic aortic valve as an isolated procedure or combined with coronary artery bypass grafting. Sample size will be determined adaptively through interim analyses performed by an Independent Statistical Unit till a maximum of 1,234 patients, enrolled at ∼60 sites in countries where the device is commercially available. Patients will be followed up for 5 years after implant. The primary end point is the number of patients free from major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular-related events at 1 year. Additional secondary outcomes will be assessed up to 5 years. DISCUSSION: PERSIST-AVR is the first prospective, randomized study comparing in-hospital and postdischarge outcomes in a robust population of patients undergoing SAVR with either the Perceval sutureless bioprosthesis or a conventional sutured stented bioprosthesis up to 5 years.  
Predictors of Outcome for Aortic Valve Reimplantation Including the Surgeon-A Single-Center Experience.  ;"INTRODUCTION:  Aortic valve reimplantation is considered technically demanding. We searched for predictors of long-term outcome including the surgeon as risk factor. METHODS:  We selected all aortic valve reimplantations performed in our department between December 1999 and January 2017 and obtained a complete follow-up. The main indications were combined aortic aneurysm plus aortic valve regurgitation (AR), 69% and aortic dissections (15%). In 14%, valves were bicuspid. Cusp repair was performed in 27% of patients. One-third received additional procedures (coronary artery bypass grafting, mitral, or arch surgery). We performed multivariable analyses for independent risk factors of short- and long-term outcomes, including ""surgeon"" as variable. Twelve different surgeons operated on 193 patients. We created three groups: surgeons A and B with 84 and 64 procedures, respectively, and surgeon C (10 surgeons for 45 patients). RESULTS:  Cardiopulmonary bypass and clamp times were 176 ± 45 and 130 ± 24 minutes, respectively. In-hospital mortality was 2%. Postoperatively, 5% had mild and 0.5% had moderate AR. Kaplan-Meier's survival estimates, freedom from reoperation, and freedom from severe AR at 12 years were 97 ± 1, 93 ± 2, and 91 ± 3%, respectively. Age and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease appeared as risk factors for perioperative complications by univariate analysis. Age, coronary artery disease, and duration of cardiopulmonary bypass, but not surgeon, presented as risk factors by multivariable analysis. CONCLUSION:  The results suggest that if a David procedure is performed successfully, long-term durability may be excellent. They also suggest that good and durable results are possible even with limited experience of the operating surgeon.  "
Sex-specific aortic root anatomy in patients with bicuspid aortic valve undergoing TAVR in a Chinese cohort.  ;"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to investigate the sex-specific aortic root anatomy in patients with bicuspid aortic valve (BAV). PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective study includes 73 consecutive patients with BAV who underwent CT evaluation before transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) between July 2013 and April 2017 in the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University. RESULT: The size of the annulus, diameter and height of the sinotubular junction (STJ), height of the coronary artery ostia, and dimension of the aorta were measured. Women had significantly smaller annulus parameters (mean diameter: 23.4 ± 1.8 vs. 26.1 ± 2.1 mm; area: 425.3 ± 59.4 vs. 527.4 ± 84.6 mm2; perimeter: 74.3 ± 5.2 vs. 83.2 ± 6.4 mm), and STJ diameter (29.7 ± 3.1 vs. 32.6 ± 4.5 mm) than men (p < 0.01 for all), even after adjustment for their smaller body surface area (BSA). Dimension of aorta and height of right coronary artery were also significantly smaller in women, although not when indexing for the BSA. The left ventricular ejection fraction of women is significantly higher than that of men before discharge (60.2 ± 9.7% vs. 53.7 ± 13.6%, p = 0.01). There were no differences between women and men in the all-cause 30-day and 1‑year mortality. CONCLUSION: Women with BAV had smaller annulus and STJ diameter after indexing for BSA, reflecting a sex-specific difference. There were no differences in 30-day and 1‑year mortality between the two groups.  "
Six-Month Performance of a 3-Dimensional Annuloplasty Ring for Repair of Functional Tricuspid Regurgitation.  ;"BACKGROUND:  Functional tricuspid regurgitation (FTR) secondary to left-sided heart disease may lead to poor quality of life and reduced long-term survival. This study evaluated clinical and functional outcomes of patients undergoing tricuspid valve (TV) repair using a rigid three-dimensional ring (Contour 3D, Medtronic) concomitant with another procedure. METHODS:  From September 2011 to July 2015, 112 patients (mean age 70.9 ± 9.0 years) were enrolled at 10 centers in Europe, Israel, and the United States. Inclusion criteria were FTR ≥ moderate and/or tricuspid annular diameter (TAD) ≥ 40 mm. Echocardiography was planned before surgery and at discharge with echocardiographic and clinical follow-ups performed 6 months postoperatively. RESULTS:  Three fourths (74.4%) of patients had higher than moderate TR. Mean TAD was 41.0 ± 7.3 mm; 61.7% of patients were in the New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III/IV. The most common concomitant procedure was mitral valve repair (57 patients, 53.3%). The 30-day mortality rate was 0.9% (n = 1). The mean EuroSCORE II was 8.9 ± 8.4% (median: 5.9%; interquartile range: 3.5-11.5%). The observed to expected ratio (O/E) based on the median was 0.1. Six deaths occurred during follow-up (three cardiac related). Mean implanted ring size was 30.3 ± 2.7. At 6 months, 94.4% of patients showed ≤ mild TR, and 92.0% were in NYHA class I/II (p < 0.001 vs baseline for both). Mean pressure gradient across the TV was 2.0 ± 1.1 mm Hg; leaflet coaptation length was 7.5 ± 3.3 mm. CONCLUSION:  The Contour 3D annuloplasty ring used for treatment of FTR substantially reduced TR for up to 6 postoperative months with low mean pressure gradients across the TV and significant improvement in NYHA class.

Concomitant carotid endarterectomy and aortic valve replacement in a patient with high risk of perioperative stroke.  ;Surgical strategy for significant carotid artery stenosis complicated with severe aortic valve stenosis is still controversial. Herein, we report a case of 80-year-old female in whom 78% stenosis by the NASCET criteria in left internal carotid artery was pointed out during preoperative checkup for symptomatic severe aortic stenosis. Carotid endarterectomy was done concomitantly with aortic valve replacement. No neurological complication occurred perioperatively.  
Effects of Isolated Impaired Fasting Glucose on Brain Injury During Cardiac Surgery Under Cardiopulmonary Bypass.  ;Objective: To evaluate the effects of isolated impaired fasting glucose (IIFG) on brain injury in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) surgery. Methods: Patients with rheumatic heart valve disease who underwent elective mitral valve replacement were included and divided into control and IIFG groups. Pre-, intra-, and postoperative blood glucose levels, serum insulin levels, insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR), lactic acid levels, and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and S100B levels were measured. The cerebral oxygen extraction ratio (OER) was calculated. Cognitive function was assessed via the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Results: HOMA-IR levels were higher in the IIFG group than the control group 30 min after the beginning of CPB, at the termination of CPB, and 2 h after the termination of CPB. Cerebral OER and lactic acid increased intraoperatively in both groups, especially in the IIFG group. NSE and S100B levels were higher in the IIFG group than in the control group at the termination of CPB, 2 h after the termination of CPB, and at 24 h postoperatively. The MMSE scores did not significantly differ between the two groups. Delirium occurred in two patients in the IIFG group, and one in the control group. No other signs and symptoms of brain injuries were detected in either group. Conclusions: The increased postoperative NSE and S100B levels in the IIFG group compared with controls may be associated with severe insulin resistance and stress hyperglycemia. However, the IIFG group did not have clinical manifestations of brain injuries, including cognitive impairment.  
Three cusps are better than two: bicuspid aortic valve and implications for military service.  ;Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is the most common congenital cardiac malformation. It is an aortopathy and is associated with other congenital heart disease. Although there is no mortality increase with BAV, the natural history increases the risk of aortic valve disease, aortic dilatation and infective endocarditis over the time frame of a full military career. Military service theoretically increases the risk of aortic dilatation and endocarditis in BAV. Conversely, there are some who have BAV who would not suffer any complications during their military career. Currently, potential UK Army recruits undergo personal/family history and physical examination plus an ECG and, although this goes beyond American Heart Association guidelines, it does not screen specifically for BAV. This would necessitate a transthoracic echo for each potential recruit but would be a considerable increase in resources-both time and financial. In addition to the recruitment medical, military personnel undergo frequent medicals, which could identify those who develop significant valvular disease. Those with mild valve disease are at lowest risk of complication. Those with aortic dilatation only remain a concern.

Transcatheter aortic valve implantation without prior balloon valvuloplasty is associated with less pronounced markers of myocardial injury.  ;"BACKGROUND: Aortic valve stenosis is the most common valvulopathy in developed countries. Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is a therapeutic alternative in symptomatic patients at high or prohibitive perioperative risk. Predilatation by balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV) under rapid ventricular pacing (RVP) has been a routine part of TAVI. However, both RVP and BAV carry substantial risks and an increasing number of interventional centers are performing TAVI without predilatation (direct TAVI). A transient decrease of left ventricular function and elevated markers of myocardial injury after TAVI with predilatation were observed in previous studies. In this study, we investigated whether direct TAVI was associated with a similar increase in cardiac biomarkers and decrease in ejection fraction in a cohort of our patients. METHODS: Consecutive patients undergoing TAVI without predilatation using a self-expanding system at a single center between April 2013 and December 2015 were followed up for one year and were retrospectively analyzed regarding mortality, safety and efficacy endpoints as well as common laboratory and echocardiographic parameters. RESULTS: A total of 164 patients (83±6 years; 56% female) were included in the analysis. According to the Valve Academic Research Consortium 2 (VARC-2) criteria the technical success rate was 96.3% and 89.1% of patients remained free of a combined safety endpoint at 30 days. Mortality rates at 30 days and 1 year were 3.0% (N.=5) and 10.4% (N.=17), respectively. TAVI without predilatation was highly effective in lowering aortic valve peak velocity from 4.4±0.6 m/s before to 1.7±0.5 m/s (P<0.01), and mean pressure gradient across the valve from 48.7±15.1 mmHg to 8.3±4.5 mmHg (<0.05). Left ventricular function remained unaltered after the intervention (51±10% prior to TAVI and 51±9% post TAVI), whereas high sensitive troponin T (hs-TnT), a well-established marker for myocardial injury, increased significantly from 26 ng/L (interquartile range=18.00-44.00) to 119 ng/L (interquartile range=73.25-166.00, P<0.001) during this time. Notably, an increase in the plasma levels of hs-TnT >15 times the upper limit of normal was associated with mortality both one month and one year after TAVI. CONCLUSIONS: TAVI without predilatation is feasible, safe and effective for aortic valve replacement in symptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis who are at high perioperative risk. In contrast to a cohort of patients who underwent TAVI with predilatation previously published by another center, our patients did not suffer from transient impairment of left ventricular function. As a marker of myocardial injury, hs-TnT showed a less pronounced increase than reported previously. This might be a marker for a prognostic benefit as hs-TnT has been shown to be a strong predictor of outcome in patients undergoing TAVI. We conclude that direct TAVI is a less invasive option involving less myocardial stress.  "

Complex Valve Surgery in Elderly Patients: Increasingly Necessary and Surprisingly Feasible.  ;"OBJECTIVES: The increasing proportion of elderly patients in cardiac surgery poses additional challenges for the clinical management and leads to a higher operative risk due to multiple comorbidities of these patients. We reviewed the outcome of patients who were 75 years and older and underwent complex multiple valve surgery at our institution. METHODS: A retrospective review was performed to identify patients who were 75 years and older and underwent multiple valve surgery between January 2011 and May 2016 at our institution. Patients were assigned to one out of four subgroups: combined aortic and mitral valve surgery (group AM), aortic and tricuspid valve surgery (group AT), mitral and tricuspid valve surgery (group MT), and aortic, mitral, and tricuspid valve surgery (group AMT). RESULTS: A total of 311 patients underwent multiple valve surgery, of whom 119 (38.3%) were 75 years and older (median: 78 [25th-75th quartile: 76-80]). The estimated operative mortality (EuroSCORE II) in the overall cohort was 10.7%. The observed 30-day mortality was 4.2% (7% in group AM, 0% in group AT, 2.2% in group MT, 3.8% in group AMT; p = 0.685). Main complications were reexplorative surgery in 16%, adverse cerebrovascular events in 6.7%, prolonged mechanical ventilation in 10.1%, renal replacement therapy in 15.1%, nosocomial pneumonia in 15.1%, and pacemaker implantation in 18.5%. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the feasibility of complex multiple valve surgery in elderly patients. The observed perioperative mortality was lower than predicted. However, we observed a substantial rate of adverse events; therefore, careful patient selection is required in this high-risk patient population.  "
Mitral valve repair in Barlow's disease by chordal reconstruction using the adjustable slip-knot technique.  ;The adjustable slip-knot technique-a procedure for facilitating repair of the mitral valve prolapse-was first performed and reported by us in 2015. This technique comprises six steps: anchor institution in the papillary muscle, flexible band positioning, saline injection to confirm the prolapsing site, neochorda setting between the anchor and leaflet, fine adjustment of the neochordal length, and knot-fixing to confirm repair. Here, we have described the first case of successful mitral valve repair using the adjustable slip-knot technique in a 51-year-old man with Barlow's disease.  
Acute kidney injury after transcatheter aortic valve implantation and mortality risk-long-term follow-up.  ;"BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) complicating transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is relatively frequent and associated with significant morbidity. Previous studies have shown a higher 30-day and 1-year mortality risk in patients with periprocedural AKI. Our aim was to identify the prognostic impact of periprocedural AKI on long-term follow-up. METHODS: This is a single-center prospective study evaluating patients undergoing TAVI for severe aortic stenosis. AKI was defined according to the Valve Academic Research Consortium 2 definition, as an absolute increase in serum creatinine ≥0.3 mg/dL or an increase >50% within the first week following TAVI. Mortality data were compared between patients who developed AKI and those who did not. Logistic and Cox regressions were used for survival analysis. RESULTS: The final analysis included 1086 consecutive TAVI patients. AKI occurred in 201 patients (18.5%). During the follow-up period, 289 patients died. AKI was associated with an increased risk of 30-day mortality {4.5 versus 1.9% in the non-AKI group; hazard ratio [HR] 3.70 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.35-10.13]}. Although 1-year mortality was higher in the AKI group in univariate analysis, it was not significant after a multivariate regression. AKI was a strong predictor of longer-term mortality [42.3 versus 22.7% for 7-year mortality; HR 1.71 (95% CI 1.30-2.25)]. In 189 of 201 patients we had data regarding recovery from AKI up to 30 days after discharge. In patients with recovery from AKI, the mortality rate was lower (38.2 versus 56.6% in the nonrecovery group; P = 0.022). CONCLUSIONS: Periprocedural AKI following TAVI is a strong risk factor for short-term as well as long-term mortality (up to 7 years). Therefore more effort is needed to reduce this complication.  "
Tetralogy of Fallot With Absent Pulmonary Valve and Nonconfluent Pulmonary Arteries: A Management Conundrum.  ;Tetralogy of Fallot with absent pulmonary valve syndrome is a rare form of congenital heart disease. Among the different variations with this rare anomaly is nonconfluent pulmonary artery branches with anomalous origin of the left pulmonary artery from the ductus arteriosus. The authors present one such case which was diagnosed prenatally to have tetralogy of Fallot with absent pulmonary valve and identified postnatally to have nonconfluent pulmonary artery branches in addition. We discuss the conundrum of respiratory management in this patient pre- and postoperatively due to a unique ventilation perfusion mismatch problem, which varies between the two lungs.  
Telemonitored exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation improves physical capacity and health-related quality of life.  ;"INTRODUCTION: Cardiac rehabilitation improves physical capacity, health-related quality of life, and reduces morbidity and mortality among cardiac patients. Telemonitored exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation may innovate existing programmes and increase participation rates. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate if telemonitored exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation improves physical capacity, muscle endurance, muscle power, muscle strength and health-related quality of life in cardiac patients. METHODS: A follow-up study on moderate risk patients with ischaemic heart and heart valve disease referred to a 12-week telemonitored exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation intervention at Aarhus University Hospital (Denmark). Participants were encouraged to exercise 60 min three times weekly with moderate/high intensity for 20 min per session. Intensity and duration of training sessions were visualised on a smartphone and uploaded to a website. Participants received individual feedback from physiotherapists on their training efforts by telephone/email. Outcome measures were changes in physical capacity (peak oxygen uptake), muscle endurance, power, and strength, and health-related quality of life between baseline end of telemonitored exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation intervention, and at six and 12 months after end of telemonitored exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation. RESULTS: Thirty-four participants completed telemonitored exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation. We identified a significant increase in peak oxygen uptake of 10%, in muscle endurance of 17%, in muscle power of 7%, and in muscle strength of 10% after the telemonitored exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation programme. Health-related quality of life was significantly improved by 19% in the physical and 17% in the mental component scores. We found no significant improvement in peak oxygen uptake between baseline and 12 months follow-up, but a significant improvement in muscle endurance (0.3 watts/kg, 95% confidence interval; 0.2-0.4), muscle power (0.4 watts/kg; 0.2-0.5), muscle strength (0.5 N/m/kg; 0.1-0.9), physical health-related quality of life (five points; 2-8) and mental health-related quality of life (six points; 3-9). DISCUSSION: This study demonstrated that the self-elected type of physical exercise in cardiac rehabilitation with telemonitoring improved all outcome measures both on the short and long-term, except for peak oxygen uptake at 12 months follow-up.

Impact of maternal pulmonary insufficiency on fetal growth in pregnancy.  ;"Rationale: It is known that fetal growth is usually proportional to left-sided cardiac output (CO), which parallels the right-sided CO and that congenital right-sided lesions are usually associated with better perinatal outcomes than left-sided lesions.Objective: Our objective was to document whether newborns from mothers with severe residual pulmonary valve insufficiency (PI) after surgical tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) or pulmonary valve stenosis (PS) correction have lower birth weight (BW) than newborns from mothers with absent, mild, or moderate PI.Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study of women affected with repaired TOF and corrected PS with varied severity of residual PI. Exclusion criteria were: left ventricular dysfunction, left-sided valvular heart disease, other right-sided structural heart disease, chronic hypertension, substance addiction, and incomplete follow-up. Pregnancies were divided into three groups: absent or mild PI, moderate PI, and severe PI. A generalized linear model with normal dependent variable distribution was built and the parameter estimation made with Generalized Estimation Equations (GEE) to take into account repeated mother in data. Variables such as gestational age at birth, maternal age, smoking, and body mass index were tested with bivariate analyses to assess their effect on BW. Only gestational age remained in the adjusted model.Results: A total of 45 patients were included (33 TOF and 12 PS) and 97 pregnancies were reported: 22 miscarriages (22.7%) (15 TOF, 7 PS) and 75 successful pregnancies (57 TOF, 18 PS). The patients were divided into three groups: 1) absent or mild PI, 2) moderate PI, and 3) severe PI groups, which comprised, respectively, 29 (15 TOF, 4 PS), 20 (10 TOF, 1 PS), and 26 successful pregnancies (8 TOF, 7 PS). Using three levels of PI (absent or mild, moderate, and severe), the unadjusted model showed a significant effect of level of PI on BW (p = .0118), as well as the adjusted model (p = .0263) with gestational age as a covariate. The estimated mean newborn's BW was 3055.8 g in the severe PI group, 3151.0 g in the moderate PI group, and 3376.4 g in the absent or mild group when adjusted for gestational age. Hence, we estimated that the mean newborn's BW is 321 g lower in the severe PI group compared with absent or mild PI group ((CI: 572.3; -68.9), p = .0087).Conclusions: Pregnancy is usually well tolerated in repaired TOF and corrected PS. Severe PI either from repaired TOF or PS is at higher risk of lower newborn's BW. Special attention must be paid to the severity of PI. Fetal growth surveillance in the third trimester is warranted.

Imaging infective endocarditis: Adherence to a diagnostic flowchart and direct comparison of imaging techniques.  ;"Comment in J Nucl Cardiol. 2020 Apr;27(2):609-611.  "
Durability of the Mitroflow Pericardial Prosthesis: Influence of Patient-Prosthesis Mismatch and New Anticalcification Treatment.  ;"BACKGROUND: The Mitroflow pericardial bioprosthesis (MPB) has been recently associated with a high incidence of early structural failures, questioning its validity as cardiac valve substitute. We have therefore reviewed our experience with this device. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 398 patients with a mean age of 75 ± 7 years (58% above the age of 75 years) had aortic valve replacement with a Mitroflow prosthesis (2005-2015). Most patients had calcific aortic stenosis (86%) and were in sinus rhythm (89%). Mean EuroSCORE II was 5.5 ± 6.2. Mean follow-up was 4 ± 2 years (range: 4 months to 10 years), which was 100% complete. RESULTS: Hospital mortality was 6.5%; at discharge, 25% of patients had a moderate patient-prosthesis mismatch and none had a severe mismatch. Cumulative incidence of structural valve deterioration in the entire series was 2% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1-4) at 5 years and 7% (95% CI: 4-14) at 8 years. Significant factors influencing MPB durability were age ≤ 65 years (p < 0.001) and the presence of patient-prosthesis mismatch (p = 0.01). No cases of structural valve deterioration were observed in patients with the new prosthetic model incorporating an anticalcification treatment the first 4 years of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The Mitroflow prosthesis has shown satisfactory results in the first decade of use. Durability appears adversely influenced by patient age and patient-prosthesis mismatch. Thus, a careful valve size selection and implantation in patients >65 years of age appears to be associated with excellent valve durability in the aortic position. Whether the new anticalcification treatment will provide a more durable prosthesis must be verified at a longer follow-up.  "
[Antagonistic function of the heart muscle : Part II: Clinical implications].  ;In the hypertrophic heart the myostructural afterload in the form of endoepicardial networks is predominant, which enhances myocardial hypertrophy. The intrinsic antagonism is derailed. Likewise, the connective tissue scaffold, i.e. the stromatogenic afterload, is enriched in the response to the derailment of antagonism in a hypertrophic heart up to regional captivation of the heart musculature. Due to the selective susceptibility of the auxotonic, contracting oblique transmural myocardial network for low dose negative inotropic medication, this promises to attenuate progress in myocardial hypertrophy. Volume reduction surgery is most effective in reducing wall stress as long as the myocardium is not critically fettered by fibrosis. The use of external mechanical circulatory support is then effective if the heart is supported in its resting mode, which means around a middle width and at minimal amplitude of motion. The takotsubo cardiomyopathy might possibly reflect an isolated, extreme stimulation of the intrinsic antagonism as a response to hormonally induced sensitization of the myocardium to catecholamine. A particular significant conclusion with respect to the diseased heart is that clinical diagnostics need new impulses with a focus on the analysis of local motion patterns and on myocardial stiffness reflecting disease-dependent antagonistic intensity. This would become a relevant diagnostic marker if corresponding (noninvasive) measurement techniques would become available.  
Mechanical Heart Valve Replacement in a Low-Middle Income Region in the Modern Era: Midterm Results from a Sub-Saharan Center.  ;BACKGROUND: The management of patients with mechanical heart valves remains a major concern in populations with limited resources and medical facilities. This study reports the clinical outcomes of patients who underwent mechanical valve implantation in a sub-Saharan center over an 8-year period. METHODS: A total of 291 mechanical valves were implanted in 233 patients in our institution between February 2008 and June 2016. A total of 117 patients underwent mitral valve replacement (MVR, 50.2%), 57 had aortic valve replacement (AVR, 24.4%), and 59 underwent both AVR and MVR (double valve replacement [DVR], 25.7%). The mean age at surgery was 27.6 ± 13.4 years (range, 7-62 years). Rheumatic etiology was found in 80.6% of the patients. Hospital mortality, late deaths, and valve-related events were reviewed at follow-up (839 patient-years, range: 1-9.4 years, complete in 93%). RESULTS: The 30-day mortality was 4.7% (11/233). The overall survival at 1 and 6 years for the whole cohort was 88.8 ± 2.1% and 78.7 ± 3.3%, respectively. The 6-year survival for AVR, MVR, and DVR was 89.3 ± 4.8%, 73.2 ± 5.4%, and 79.3 ± 5.8%, respectively (p = 0.15). The freedom from neurologic events and anticoagulation-related bleeding at 6 years was 93.1 ± 2.1% and 78.9 ± 3.7%, respectively. No patient had reoperation at follow-up. No case of prosthetic valve thrombosis was identified. Eight full-term pregnancies were reported. CONCLUSION: This preliminary experience reports acceptable midterm results after mechanical heart valve implantation in our region. Both accurate surgical evaluation and strategies, either financial or social, facilitating patient's education and medical assistance are crucial to ensure good results. Long-term follow-up and further studies comparing current nonthrombogenic options are warranted to draw reliable conclusions.  
Is two better than one? Re-evaluating the surgical approval process for TAVR.  ;DOI: 10.1002/ccd.27666 PMID: 30019822 [Indexed for MEDLINE]  
Impact of Patient-Prosthesis Mismatch following Aortic Valve Replacement on Long-Term Survival and Quality of Life.  ;BACKGROUND: The impact of patient-prosthesis mismatch (PPM) after aortic valve replacement (AVR) on long-term survival and quality of life (QoL) remains controversial. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of PPM on long-term survival and QoL in a large cohort of patients treated with isolated stented biological AVR in a single-center experience. METHODS: We analyzed data of 632 consecutive patients following isolated stented biological AVR between 2007 and 2012 at our institution. We evaluated the QoL (393 evaluable patients) using the Short Form 12-item Health Survey (SF-12) questionnaire via telephone call and the impact of PPM on long-term survival (533 evaluable patients) by Kaplan-Meier's estimate. RESULTS: Severe PPM (<0.65 cm2/m2) had a negative impact on physical component summary (PCS) score (SF-12) compared with patients with moderate or no PPM (p = 0.014), while the mental component summary (MCS) score (SF-12) was not affected by the degree of PPM (p = 0.133). Long-term survival was not different among the three different PPM groups investigated (p = 0.75). CONCLUSION: Severity of PPM demonstrated no influence on long-term survival and MCS score (SF-12), but it was associated with a lower PCS score (SF-12) in patients with severe PPM.  
Congenital heart defects: the 10-year experience at a single center.  ;"Objective: We aimed to evaluate congenital heart disease (CHD) cases according to EUROCAT subgroup classification that were diagnosed during the prenatal period in our center.Methods: CHDs that were prenatally diagnosed using ultrasonography and confirmed by fetal echocardiography were reviewed over a 10-year period. Subgroup classification was finalized at the post-partum period in terms of the EUROCAT guide 1.3. Congenital heart defect subtypes and obstetric outcomes (gestational week at delivery, birth weight, gender, extracardiac structural abnormalities, karyotype results if performed) were analyzed.Results: The data of 180 cases with CHD were examined. Left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOT) was the most common CHD subtype (57/180; 31.6%), which included 48, five, and four cases of hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS), coarctation of the aorta, and aortic valve atresia/stenosis, respectively. Eighteen pregnancies were terminated; the most common CHD subtype among patients of terminated pregnancies was hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) (n = 7, 38.8%). The most common extracardiac malformations were a single umbilical artery, esophageal atresia, and situs inversus in our study group. Eighteen of the 96 (18.75%) neonates with CHD died during the neonatal period. The most common CHD subtype was HLHS (7/18; 38%) among the newborns who died after birth.Conclusion: Prenatal diagnosis of a CHD and subgroup classification is very important for clinical decision making, including prenatal management, recommendations for termination of the pregnancy, postnatal management of the patient, and for early referral to pediatric cardiology and cardiovascular surgery centers.

Relation of Preoperative and Postoperative Echocardiographic Parameters With Rejection and Mortality in Liver Transplant Patients.  ;OBJECTIVES: Survival in liver transplant after end-stage liver disease is associated with major cardiac functions. In a significant number of patients with end-stage liver disease, cardiac dysfunctions may be observed, which can include high-output heart failure, cardiac valve disease, and pulmonary venous and arterial hypertension. All of these affect perioperative survival. The aim of our study was to determine whether preoperative and postoperative echocardiographic parameters, specifically right heart-related tricuspid regurgitation, estimated systolic pulmonary arterial pressure, and tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion, are associated with rejection and mortality in liver transplant patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adult patients (> 18 years old) who underwent liver transplant at our center between January 2011 and March 2017 were included in the study, with 64 patients retrospectively screened. The echocardiographic images that were taken immediately before and immediately after liver transplant were evaluated. The patients were divided into 2 groups according to rejection data and mortality. All parameters were analyzed for both variables. RESULTS: For the 24 patients with liver rejection and 40 patients without liver rejection, there were no statistically significant differences in terms of demographic data, echocardiographic parameters, and laboratory data. However, when patients were evaluated according to survival, there was a statistically significant difference between these 2 groups concerning the echocardiography parameters of systolic pulmonary arterial pressure (P = .005), tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (P = .001), and postoperative right ventricular width (P = .01). CONCLUSIONS: Echocardiography, being a simple and easily accessible technique that is reliable in excluding pulmonary hypertension diagnosis, can be used as a guide in the evaluation of right ventricular function and tricuspid regurgitation, particularly in patients who are not hemodynamically stable before and after liver transplant.  
Prognosis of Transcatheter Closure Compared with Surgical Repair of Paravalvular Leak after Prosthetic Valve Replacement: A Retrospective Comparison.  ;OBJECTIVE: Paravalvular leak (PVL) after valve replacement remains clinically challenging. Percutaneous closure is an effective therapy for patients with PVLs because reoperation is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality. The purpose of this study was to retrospectively compare the clinical outcome of transcatheter closure and surgical repair in patients with a PVL. METHODS: From January 2000 to May 2016, 131 patients with PVL were treated at three major medical centers in China. Perioperative characteristics and outcomes of the procedure were reviewed. RESULTS: Sixty-eight (51.9%) patients with PVLs were treated with percutaneous transcatheter closure (group I). The procedure was successful in 67 (98%) with no hospital deaths. Sixty-three (48.1%) patients with PVLs had a reoperation (group II). Five of the surgical patients had a third open-heart operation for residual regurgitation, and one underwent successful percutaneous closure. Six patients died in the hospital postoperatively. All patients in group II but only 11 in group I needed perioperative blood transfusions. The procedural time and hospital stay after the procedure were significantly shorter in group I than in group II. At the 1-year follow-up, cardiac function improved by ≥ 1 New York Heart Association functional class in 55 (82%) patients in group I and in 39 (68%) patients in group II. CONCLUSIONS: Transcatheter closure was shown to be a safe, effective therapeutic option in patients with PVL. It was associated with a lower hospital mortality rate, shorter procedural time, and fewer blood transfusions than surgical treatment in selected patients.

Pulmonary Resection for Lung Cancer Following Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation for Severe Aortic Valve Stenosis: A Case Report.  ;An 82-year-old woman was referred to our hospital because of dyspnea on effort. Echocardiography revealed severe aortic valve stenosis (AS). Simultaneously, chest computed tomography (CT) revealed a 19-mm nodule in the lower lobe of the right lung, and bronchoscopic biopsy revealed adenocarcinoma. She underwent transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) for severe AS. Three weeks later, she underwent lower lobectomy of the right lung and mediastinal dissection for the lung cancer. Her postoperative course was good, and she was discharged 8 days postoperatively. In conclusion, we encountered a patient who successfully underwent pulmonary resection for lung cancer following TAVI for severe AS. We suggest that pulmonary resection following TAVI is an acceptable choice for lung cancer in patients with severe AS because of the lack of a need for cardiopulmonary bypass, the high safety and efficacy of two-stage therapy, and the short period between the two therapies.  
Stanford Type A Acute Aortic Dissection with Intimal Intussusception.  ;In case of complete circumferential dissection of the ascending aorta, the dissected flap has the potential to fold backwards, causing several complications. We report two cases of Stanford type A acute aortic dissection (AAD) whose intimal flaps intussuscepted into the left ventricular outflow tract.Case 1: A 41-year-old man with AAD in whom transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed the dissected flap as folded back into the left ventricular outflow tract, causing severe aortic regurgitation (AR) with rapidly progressing acute pulmonary edema. Despite performing salvage surgery, the patient could not be rescued.Case 2: An 81-year-old man with annuloaortic ectasia developed Stanford type A AAD. TTE showed an extremely mobile intimal flap intussuscepting into the left ventricular outflow tract. However, AR was not severe as it was prevented by the flap itself. The patient was rescued by performance of the modified Bentall procedure.  
"""Vascular Outlining"": Augmented Imaging for Transfemoral Access-A Preclinical Investigation.  ";"BACKGROUND: Advanced visualization software tools have been used in clinics to improve the safety and accuracy of transcatheter procedure. Imaging techniques have greatly evolved during the era of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). In a retrospective analysis, we investigated the feasibility of augmented fluoroscopy for iliofemoral access using a novel ""Vascular Outlining"" roadmapping technology. METHODS: The Vascular Outlining prototype device (Philips Healthcare) application was used with iliofemoral angiography of 10 patients undergoing transfemoral TAVI. The software processes any conventional angiographic sequences, extracting the static outline of vessels and projecting the two-dimensional vessel margins as a roadmap on live fluoroscopy. Post-processed results were clinically assessed to determine whether the technical performance of the tool is sufficient. RESULTS: Augmented imaging was possible in all investigated angiography sequences. The analysis of software-generated images showed accurate projection of the two-dimensional outline of the iliofemoral vessels as an overlay on the live fluoroscopy image in most cases. Overlay inaccuracy was only observed in cases with low contrast or patient movement. CONCLUSION: In static and contrasted angiography sequences, ""Vascular Outlining"" showed accurate image overlay. We identified that the quality of the vascular outline is dependent on the opacification of the contrast injection and the stability of the patient on the table. With further development. this application might increase the accuracy of femoral puncture and reduce the incidence of vascular complications. Clinical trials are needed to confirm these hypotheses.

Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia: Anesthetic Challenges and Review of Literature.  ;"Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH; Fredrickson IIa) is a rare autosomal dominant hereditary disease associated with increased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. We hereby report anesthetic challenges in a rare case of HoFH having severe progressive aortic stenosis, mitral regurgitation, diffuse aortic and carotid vessel involvement, and severe left ventricular dysfunction. The patient underwent a Konno aortoventriculoplasty with mechanical prosthesis along with mitral valve repair.  "
Prolonged Intensive Care Unit Stay Following Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.  ;"PURPOSE: Postoperative intensive care unit (ICU) stay after cardiac surgeries has been extensively studied, but little attention has been given to ICU stay following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). This study examined ICU stay after TAVR. METHODS: Two hundred and forty-five patients who underwent TAVR between April 2010 and October 2016 were studied retrospectively. We investigated the status of ICU stay, the predictors of prolonged ICU stay (PICUS), and its impact on short- and long-term outcomes. Prolonged ICU stay was defined as post-TAVR ICU stay longer than 2 days (day of TAVR + 1 day). RESULTS: Length of ICU stay was 2.6 ± 4.9 days, and PICUS was identified in 14.7% of the patients. The predominant reason for PICUS was congestive heart failure or circulatory failure (41.7%). Pulmonary dysfunction and nontransfemoral approach were independent predictors of PICUS (pulmonary dysfunction: odds ratio = 2.64, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.05-7.35; nontransfemoral approach: odds ratio = 2.81, 95% CI: 1.15-6.89). Prolonged ICU stay was associated with higher rate of 30-day combined end point (PICUS vs non-PICUS: 44.4% vs 3.3%, P < .0001), longer postoperative hospital stay (49.9 ± 141.9 days vs 12.0 ± 6.0 days, P < .0001), and lower rate of discharge home (77.8% vs 95.2%, P = .0002). Patients with PICUS had worse long-term survival (P < .0001), and PICUS was a predictor of mortality (hazard ratio: 4.21, 95% CI: 2.09-8.22). CONCLUSION: Prolonged ICU stay following TAVR was found in 14.7%, and pulmonary dysfunction and nontransfemoral approach were associated with PICUS. Short- and long-term prognoses were worse in patients with PICUS than those without.  "
Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy Complicating Percutaneous Pulmonary Valve Implantation in a Child.  ;Takotsubo cardiomyopathy describes a sudden onset cardiomyopathy with acute impairment of left ventricular function and spontaneous resolution over time. Only a few cases of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy in childhood have been described. We report the case of a 12-year-old girl with repaired tetralogy of Fallot who experienced acute onset of left ventricular dysfunction without coronary arterial involvement, suggesting Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, during an interventional catheterization procedure. Cardiogenic shock necessitated mechanical circulatory support with extracorporeal membrane oxygenator for ten days and mechanical ventilation for 12 days. The girl recovered without sequelae. Percutaneous pulmonary valve implantation was performed four months later without complications. Unusual aspects of this case include the use of mechanical circulatory support during the recovery phase of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy in a patient with congenital heart disease.  
A Unique Intracardiac Shunt: Identifying Complex Anatomy in Reoperative Adult Congenital Heart Disease.  ;Adult patients with repaired congenital heart disease are presenting with previously unseen types of residual lesions and consequences of prior repair. Patients with d-transposition of the great arteries repaired with atrial switch operations are returning with dysrhythmias and atrioventricular valve disease requiring intervention. We present the challenging case of a young adult with a residual shunt identified on preoperative three-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography, the precise anatomy of which was only characterized intraoperatively.
